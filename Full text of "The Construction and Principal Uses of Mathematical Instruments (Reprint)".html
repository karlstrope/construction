FOREWORD 



'Mathematicks are now become a popular Study, and make a part of the Education of almost 
every Gentleman.' 

Thus Stone began the preface to his translation of Nicolas Bion's master-work over two hundred 
years ago, and thus today, but less neatly, speak our Ministers of Education, our Commissions, 
our Pundits and our Authorities. 

Nicolas Bion (165?— 1733) was a most successful, if not overly original, maker of scientific instru- 
ments. He had however the rare gift of explaining clearly to the general reader how things worked. 
His Traite de la Construction et Principaux Usages des Instruments de Mathematique was first published 
in 1709 and had run into five editions in French by 1752, it had also been published in German and, 
as late as 1799, the Directoire was seriously considering republishing the work. 

Edmund Stone (1700-1768) published his first translation of Bion in 1723, and, thanks to this 
and the influence of his patron, became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1725. Stone's patron was 
the Duke of Argyll on whose estates his father was employed as gardener. In 1758 he published 
a further edition of the work in response to popular demand with A Supplement concerning a further 
account of some of the most useful Mathematickal Instruments as now Improved. 

This work gives the method of construction and the clearest possible description of the use of 
nearly every measuring and calculating instrument in use during the seventeenth and eighteenth 
centuries. 

Stone added several important instruments to Bion's nearly exhaustive list, for example: the 
description and use of the Gunter's Scale, the Plain Scale, Everard's and Coggeshall's Slide Rules, 
the English Sector, the Proportional Compasses, the Sea Quadrant, the English Theodolite, the 
Circumferentor, the Surveying Wheel or Way-Wiser, the Gunners' Callipers and Gunter's 
Quandrant. Other specialised authors describe one or two such instruments, but nowhere else 
can be found such a wide-ranging, detailed, clear and never prolix description of the instruments 
that served the Age of Reason. 

This is a book to be read together with the Voyages of Dampier and of Anson, with Robinson 
Crusoe, with the letters of Lord Chesterfield to his Son; it is a book that to my mind could be of 
great use in the class-room, to seize the imagination of the ingenious young, readily bored by 
arithmetic without apparent purpose; it is a book that in our Apocalyptic times would be of 
greater use as a manual of survival than many dealing with present day technology. 

In my own experience it gives clearer and simpler solutions to problems of dialling, surveying 
and the applied mathematics than any other work to which I have easy access. 

Its only disadvantage up to now has been its rarity and its price, and to that, this reprint provides 
the happy solution. It becomes once more a tool, a work-book that need not be kept sterilized in a 
library or a show-case for fear of theft or damage, it is a tool that can be used. 

It is obviously essential to Museums to historians and students, to collectors of mathematical 
instruments, to artisans and to such dealers as have the leisure and inclination to study their stock 
in trade from other than a mercantile point of view.

To his O R A C E, 

JOHN, 

Duke of Argyll and Greemvich, &amp;c. 

Lord Steward of His Majefty's Houfliold, 




My Lord, 

HE Subject of the following Treatife feems of Importance enough 
to claim Your Grace's Patronage j and of Ufe enough to deferve it. 
It made it's firft Appearance under that of his Highnefs the Duke of 
Orleans : and, to render it's fecond equally Magnificent, craves now 
to be introduced under that of Your Grace. Indeed, as the firft De- 
fign of it's appearing in Englijh was laid in Your Grace's Family ; and as it was 
carried on and finifhed in the fame, it feems to have fome Title to Your Grace's 
Countenance : It naturally feeks Protection where it found it's Birth, and lays claim 
to the Privileges of a Native of your Family, as well as thofe of a Domeftick. 
What I have faid of my Book, holds almoft equally good of myfelf. I have 
been, the greateft part of my Life, an humble Retainer to Your Grace. In Your 
Family it was, I firft caught an Affection for Mathematicks ; and it was under 
Your Countenance, that I took occafion to Cultivate them. Your Grace therefore 
has a kind of Property in all I do of this kind, and it would be an Injuftice to lay 
it at any other Feet. 

ANOTHER Perfon would have here taken Occafion to expatiate on Your 
Grace's Character : Dedicators, Your Grace very well knows, are great Dealers in 
that Way ; and look on it as one of the Privileges of their Place, to praife their 
Patrons without Offence. Accordingly, Your Grace's Lineage would have been 
traced up to the earlieft Times, and the Virtues of Your Noble Anceftors drawn 
out to View. Your Grace's perfonal Merit, mining and confpicuous as it is, would 
have been fet off in it's full Light, and Your Heroick and Virtuous Atchievements 
painted in all their Colours. Flanders, Bavaria, Spain, and Scot/ana 1 , would have 
been called in, as Witneffes of Your Glory ; of Your Prudence, as a General ; and 
Your Bravery, as a Soldier : Nor would Your Integrity, as a Minifter ; Your Mag- 
nificence, as a Nobleman ; or Your Love of Liberty and Your Country, as a Pa- 
triot, have been omitted. For myfelf, My Lord, it is my Bufinefs rather to ad- 
mire than applaud You : Panegyrick is a thing out of my Province ; and Your 
Grace would be a fufferer by the beft Things I could fay. Were I allowed to 
touch on any Thing, it fhould be Your Private rather than Your Popular Cha- 
racter, rather as you are a Gentleman, than as a General, or a Hero. If You 

have 



The DEDICATION. 

have every thing Great and Heroick in the latter j You have all that is Beautiful 
and Amiable in the former. To enumerate every thing of this Kind vifible in your 
Grace, would be to give a detail of a whole Syftem of Virtues j and to draw your 
Picture at full, would be little lefs than to collect into one Piece what is Great and 
Good in a thoufand : A Work fitter for a Volume than a Dedication. 

M Y Zeal for Your Grace had like to have driven me beyond either my Duty 
or Defign. It was my Refolution not to fay any thing that might look like Praife ; 
but I find one cannot do common Juftice to Your Grace, without running into the 
Appearance of it. I am fenfible there is no Topick lefs inoffenfive to You, than 
that of Your own Merit : but the Misfortune is, there is none fo engaging or fo 
copious. 'Tis pity You mould value Praife fo little ; when You deferve it fo much : 
For hence, a Perfon, who would not be Ungrateful, is under a Neceflity of be- 
coming Troublefome. I have reafon to fear Your Grace's Refentments, for hav-

ATHEMATICKS are now become a popular Study, and 
make a part of the Education of almojl every Gentleman. Indeed, 
they are fo ufeful, fo entertaining and extenfive a Branch of Know- 
ledge, that it is no wonder they Jhould gain Ground ; and that un- 
common Countenance they now find, mufl be ejleemed as an Injlance of 
the Felicity of the Age, and the good Senfe of the People. Mathe- 
maticks have wherewith to gratify all Tafies, and to employ all Ta- 
lents. Here the greatejl Genius has room to exert his utmojl Faculties, and the meanefi 
will not fail to find fomething on a Level with his. Their Theory, affords a noble Field 
for the Speculative Part of Mankind j and, their Practice, an ample Province for the 
Men of Action and Bufinefs. 

THE Majlers in Mathematicks have not been wanting in their Rejpect to the reft 
of Mankind : They have frankly communicated their Knowledge to the World; and have 
publijhed Treatifes on every Branch of their Art : Infomuch, that a Man who has a 
Difpofition to this Study, will find himfelf abundantly fupplied with Helps, to what 
Part foever he applies himfelf There feems, then, but little wanting to Mathematicks, 
confidered as a Science : If there be any Defect, it is when confidered as an Art. 1 
mean, Mathematicks appears more acceffible, as well as more extenfive, on the Side of 
their Theory than on that of their Practice. Not that the latter has been lefs laboured 
by Authors than the fo?'mer, but becaufe a fufficient Regard does not feem to have been 
had to the Inftruments, whereon it wholly depends. 

Mathematical Instruments are the Means by which thofe Sciences 
are rendered ufeful in the Affairs of Life. By their AJJifiance it is, that fubtile and 
abjlract Speculation is reduced into Act. They connect, as it were, the Theory to the 
Practice, and turn what was bare Contemplation, to the mofi fubfiantial Ufes. The 
Knowledge of thefe is the Knowledge of Practical Mathematicks : So that the De- 
fcripttons and Ufes of Mathematical Inftruments, make, perhaps, one of the mqft 
ferviceable Branches of Learning in the World. The Way then to render the Knowledge 
of Mathematicks general and diffufive, is by making that of Mathematical Inftru- 
ments fo : With a View of which kind, our Author feems to have engaged in the follow-

The Tranflator's PREFACE. 

ing Traitife -, at leaft, it was from a View of this kind, that I undertook to trahftate 
it. 

T HE Defign of the Work, however ufiful, yet feems to be New among us. Parti- 
cular Authors have indeed touched on particular Parts : One, for Inftance, having de- 
scribed the Globe j another the Sector ; and a third the Quadrant : but for a general 
Courfe, or Collection of Mathematical Inftruments, / know of none that has attempted 
it. It is true, in Harris'* Lexicon, we have the Names of mojl of them ; and in 
Moxon'5 Dictionary the Figures of many : But the Accounts given of them in both 
are fo port, lame, and deficient, that there is but little to be learned from either of 
them. 

I chofe M. BIO N'i Book for the Ground-Work of mine, as judging it better 
to make ufe of a good fafe Model provided to my Hands, than run the Rifque of pro- 
ceeding upon my own Bottom. The French Inftruments defcribed by him, are, in the 
main, the fame with thofe ufed among us. Such Englifh Inftruments as he has omitted, 
I have been careful to fupply : And throughout, have taken the Liberty not only to make 
up his Deficiencies, but amend his Errors. 

THOSE who deftre an Inventory of the Work, have it as follows : 

IT is divided into Eight Books, and each of thefe fub divided into Chapters. To the 
whole are prefixed Preliminary Definitions neceffary for the underftanding of what 
follows. 

IN the Firft Book are laid down the Conftruclion and Principal TJfes of the moft 
Jimple and common Inftruments, as CompafTes, Ruler, Drawing- Pen, Porte-Craion, 
Square, Protractor. And to thefe I have added five other Articles, of the Carpenter's 
Joint-Rule, the Four-foot Gauging-Rod, Everard'j Sliding-Rule, CoggefliaU'i Slid— 
ing-Rule, the Plotting-Scale, an improved Protractor, the Plain-Scale, and Gunter'j 
Scale. 

THE Second Book contains the Conftruclion and Principal Ufes of the French 
Sector, (or Compafs of Proportion) thofe of various Gauging-Rods. To this Book I 
have added the Conftruclion and principal Ufes of the Englifh Sector. 

THE Subject of the Third Book is very much diverfified. Under this are found the 
Conftruclion and Ufes of fever al curious and diverting as well as ufeful Inftruments ; 
particularly CompafTes of various kinds, Parallel-Rules, the Parallelogram or Penta- 
graph, &amp;c. Under this Head are alfo laid down feveral Things not eafily to be met 
with elfewhere : As, the Manner of arming Load-Stones ; the Compofition of divers 
Microfcopes, with feveral other curious Amufements. To the firft Chapter of this Book 
I have added the Defcriptions and Ufes of the Turn-up CompafTes and Proportional 
CompafTes, with the Seftor-Lines upon them, as alfo the Manner of projecting them, 

IN the Fourth Book you have the Conftruclion and Ufes of the principal Inftruments 
ufed in taking Plots, meafuring or laying out Lands, taking Heights, Diftances, accef- 
fible or inacceftible ; Staffs, for inftance, Fathoms [or Toifes], Chains, Surveying- 
CrofTes, Recipient- Angles, Theodolites, Semi-Circles, the Compafs, with their Ufes 
in Fortification. To this Book I have added three Articles of the Englifh Theodolite, 
Plain-Table, Circumferentor, and Surveying- Wheel. What I have there added of 
the Ufes of thofe Inftruments, though but Jhort, yet I flatter my f elf will be fowid more 
Iiftruclive than much larger Accounts of them in the common Books of Surveying. 

THE Fifth Book contains the Conftruclion of feveral different kinds of Water-Levels ; 
with the Manner of reel if y ing and ufing them, for the Conveyance of Water from one 
Place to another. In this Book are alfo found the Conftruclion a?id Ufes of Inftruments 
for Gunnery ; And to thefe I have added the Conftruclion and Ufe of the Englifh Cal- 
lipers. 

IN 



The Tranflator's PREFACE, vii 

IN the Sixth Book are contained the Conjlrutfiotl and Ufes of Aftronomical Infiru- 
ments j as the Aftronomical Quadrant, and Micrometer, with an Injlrument of Mr 
tie la Hire'* for J hewing the Eclipfes of the Sun and Moon, and Mr Huygens'j 
Second Pendulum-Clock for Aftronomical Obfervations. In this is alfo Jloewn the 
Manner of making Celejiial Obfervations according to Mr de la Hire and Caffini. To 
this Book I have added four Chapters, containing the Defcription and general Ufes of 
the Globes, with the manner of making them : The Defcription and Ufes of the Ptole- 
maick and a Cdpernican Sphere, the Orrery, and a Micrometer, better than that de- 
fcribed by the Author, and of Gunter'j Quadrant. 

THE Seventh Book contains the ConJlruSlion and Ufes of the Sea-Compafs, the 
Azimuth-Compafs, Sea-Quadrant, Fore-Staff, and other Injlrument s for taking Alti- 
tudes at Sea ; as likewife the Conjlruclion and Ufes of the Sinical-Quadrant, and Mer- 
catorV Charts. 

IN the Eighth Book are found the Conjlrudlions and Ufes of all kinds o/* Sun-Dials, 
whether fixed or portable -, with the Injlrument s ufed in drawing them ; as alfo a Moon- 
Dial, Nocturnal, &amp;c. To this is fubjoined a Jhort Defcription of the principal Tools 
ufed in making Mathematical Instruments : And, lajllyj I have added, byway of Ap- 
pendix, the Conjlruclion of the great Eclipfe of the Sun, that will happen May the i ith, 
j 724, by the Sector.

Definitions necejfary for underflanding this Treatife. 

^MPOl N T is that which hath no Parts, and confequently is indivifible. 
A Line is Length without Breadth, whofe Original is from a 
Point 

There are three kinds of Lines ; viz*. Right Lines, Curve Lines, 
and Mixed Lines. 

A Right Line is the fhorteft of all thofe that can be drawn from 
one Point to another. 

A Curve Line is that which doth not go directly from one of its 
Extremes to the other, but winds about. 

A Mixed Line is that which hath one Part ftrait, and the other 
crooked. 

Lines compared as to their Pofitions or Situations, are either parallel, perpendicular, or 
oblique. 

Parallel Lines are fuch that always keep the fame Diftance to each other, and which, if 
both ways infinitely produced, will never meet, whether they be Right Lines, or Curves. 

Perpendicular Lines are thofe that meeting, incline no more to one fide than to the other ; 
and therefore they make two equal Angles, which coufequently will be Right Angles. 

Oblique Lines are thofe, which meeting one another, form oblique and unequal Angles, 
that is, acute and obtufe Angles. 

Moreover, Lines have other Denominations ; which are as follow : 

An upright, plumb, or vertical Line, is that which, if produced, would pafs through the 
Center of the Earth, as the String of a fufpended Plummet. 

A horizontal Line, or Line of apparent Level, is a right Line that touches the Surface of 
the Earth in one Point, or which isparallel to a Tangent in that Point. 

A Line of true Level is that, whofe Points are all equally diftant from the Center of the 
Earth, as the Circumference of the fame. 
A finite Line is that whofe Length is determined.

There are alfo occult Lines, drawn with the Points of Com pedes, or more properly with 
a Pencil, becaufe then they may be eafier rubbed out: Thefe Lines mult not be feen when 
the Work is finifhed, unlefs they are left to mow how the Operation is performed ; and 
then they are dotted, which is done with a .Dotting- Wheel. 
Fig. io. The Lines that mufb remain, and which are called apparent Lines, are drawn with Ink, 

put into a drawing Pen, as plain and fmall as poffible, by means of the Screw belonging 

to it. 
Fig. 9. A Tangent is a Line touching a Figure, and not cutting it •, as the Line A B. 

Fi^ % o. A Subtenfe, or chord Line, is that which joins the Extremes of an Arc •, as the Line C D. 

Fig. 11. An Arc is a Part of a Circumference ; as t\\t Arc D F E. 

The different kinds of Curve Lines are infinite ; but the fimpleft, mod regular, and tafiefl 
to draw, is a Circle. 
p; g ,, A circular Line, or the Circumference of a Circle, is a Curve •, all the Parts of which are 

equally diftant from one Point in the middle of it, which is called the Center of the Circle. 

Ri«-ht Lines, drawn from the Center of a Circle to the Circumfererence, are called Radii, 
or Semidiameters •, as N O. 

Thofe Chords that pafs through the Center of a Circle, are called Diameters ; as M P. 
The Circumference of every Circle is fuppofed to be divided .into 360 equal Parts, called 

Degrees. 

The Number 360 was chofen by Geometricians for the Divifion of a Circle, becaufe it 
may be more exactly fubdivided into many equal Parts, without any Remainder, than any 
other* : as for example s half of 360 is 180, ^ is 120, ~ is 90, \ is 72, 4 is 6o, and fo of other 
of its aliquot Parts. 

Every Degree is divided into 60 equal Parts, called Minutes, every Minute into 60 Se- 
conds, and every Second into 60 Thirds, &amp;c. which are thus diftinguifhed 40 s 3.5' 49" 57"' 
fignify forty Degrees, thirty-five Minutes, forty-nine Seconds, and fifty- feven Thirds. The 
aforefaid Divifion ferves for meafuring of Angles \ but the Sub-Divifions into Seconds and 
Thirds are not ufed, unlefs in great Circumferences. 

The Opening of two different Lines cutting one another, or meeting in the fame Point, 
is called an Angle, 
fig. 12. When two Lines cut, or meet each other in one Point on a Plane, the Angle they make 

with each other, is called a plane-Angle, or a plain- Angle. 

When the Lines that make a plain-Angle, are ftrait Lines, the Angle is called a Right- 
lined Angle. 
Fig. 13. If the two Lines forming an Angle, are Curves, the Angle is called a Curve-lined Angle. 

Fig. 14. If one of the Lines is a Curve, and the other a ftrait Line, the Angle is called a Mixed- 

lined Angle. 

The two Lines that make an Angle, are called its Sides ; the Point wherein they cut or 
meet each other, being the Vertex. 

When an Angle is exprelTed by three Letters, that in the middle reprefents the Angle, and 
the other two the Sides. 

In producing or leffening the Sides of an Angle, the Quantity of the faid Angle is not at all 
altered thereby -, for the Magnitude of an A ngle is not meafured by the Magnitude of its Sides. 

The Meafure of a Right-lined Angle is the Portion of a Circle comprehended between 
its Sides, whofe Vertex is the Center of "the Circle : It matters not how big the Radius of 
Fig. 15. the Circle be •, becaufe whether the circular Arcs, comprehended between the Sides A B, 

A C, of the Angle be bigger or leffer, they ftill have the fame Number of Degrees. 

If, for example, the Arc of a fmall Circle be 60 Degrees, which is the fixth part of the 
whole Circumference, the Arc of a greater Circle will likewife be 60 Degrees, or the fixth 
part of the Circumference of the greater Circle, and the Angle B A C will be 60 Degrees. 

Every Angle is either a right, acute, or obtufe Angle, 
pjg ,5, The Meafure of a right Angle is an Arc of 90 Degrees, which is l of the Circumference 

of a Circle. 
Fig. 17. An acute Angle is leffer than 90 Degrees. 

pi„ l8&lt; An obtufe Angle is more than 90 Degrees. 

There can be no Angle of 180 Degrees, which is the Semi-Circumference of a Circle ; 
for two right Lines fo pofited, cannot cut, but will meeat each other directly, and confe- 
quently will make but one right Line, which will be the Diameter of a Circle, 
pj- , ,. The Sine of an Angle or Arc, is half the Chord of double the fame Arc : as for example, 

to have the Sine of the Angle DAE, or of the Arc D E (which is the Meafure of it) by 
doubling the Arc E D, you will have the Arc E D F, whofe Chord is E F, whereof E H, its 
half, is the right Sine of the Angle DAE: the Line DG is the Tangent of the fame Angle, 
and the Line A G is its Secant. 

Two Arcs together making a whole Circle, have the fame Chord ; for it is maniftfr, 
that the Line EF is as well the Chord of the greater Arc EBCF, as of the lelftr 
oneEDF. 

* Our Author Jhould have faid, Leffer Number, 

For 



under/landing this Treatife. 



For the fame reafon two Arcs, which together make a Semicircle, have but ohe right 
Sine; as the Line E H is as well the Sine of the obtufe Angle E A I, or of the Arc E B 1, 
which is its Meafure, as of the acute Angle E A D, or of the Arc E D. 
The fame may be faid of Tangents and Secants. 

The Sine of 90 Degrees, which is the Radius or Semidiameter, as D A, is called the 
Sinus Totus. 

A Surface, or Superficies, is that which hath only Length and Breadth. 
There are two kinds of Surfaces, viz. Plane and Curve. 

A Plane Surface is that to which a right Line may be applied all manner of ways ; as the Fig. 19. 
Top of a very fmooth Table. 

A Curve Surface is that to which a right Line cannot be applied all manner of ways j Fig. 20, 
they are either Convex, or Concave •, as the Outfide of a Shell is Convex, and the Infide 
Concave. 

Term, or Bound, is that which limits any thing -, as Points are the Bounds of Lines, Lines 
the Bouncis of Surfaces, and Surfaces the Bounds of Solids. 
A Figure is that which is bounded every way. 

Figures that be terminated under only one Bound, are Circles, and Ellipfes, or Ovals, 
which are bounded by only one Curve Line. 

Figures terminated by feveral Bounds, or Lines, are the Triangle or Trigon, which hath Fig. 21. 
three Sides and three Angles. 

The Square, or Tetragon, which hath four. Fig. 22. 

The Pentagon, five. Fi g . 23 . 

The Hexagon, fix. Fig . 2+ . 

The Heptagon, feven. 
The Octagon, eight. 
The Nonagon, nine. 
The Decagon, ten. 
The Undecagon, eleven. 
And the Dodecagon, twelve. 

All the aforefaid Figures, and thofe having a greater Number of Sides : are called by the 
general Name of Polygon, which fignifies Figures having many Angles •, and for diftinguifh- 
ing them, there is added the Number of Sides : as a Decagon may be called a Polygon of ten 
Sides ; likewife a Dodecagon is called a Polygon of twelve Sides, and fo of others. 

Figures, whofe Sides and Angles are equal (as thofe before-named) are called regular 
Polygons. 

Thofe Figures, whofe Sides and Angles are unequal, are called Irregular Polygons. 
Triangles are diftinguifhed by their Sides or their Angles. 

As to their Sides •, that Triangle which hath its three Sides equal, is called an Equilateral p,g t ^ 
Triangle, and is alfo equiangular. 

That Triangle which hath only two equal Sides, is called an Ifofceles Triangle. 
And that which hath three unequal Sides, is called a Scalene Triangle. As to their An- 
gles •, a Triangle, which hath one right Angle, is called right-angled ; and the Side op- 
polite to the right Angle, is called the Hypothenufe. 

That which hath one Angle obtufe, is called an obtufe angled Triangle. 
That which harh all the Angles acute, is called an acute angled Triangle. 
Quadrilateral Figures, or Figures having four Sides, have different Appellations. 
It the oppofite Sides are parallel, the quadrilateral Figure is called by the general name 
of Para'Ulogram. 

If a Parallelogram hath four equal Sides, and the four Angles rjght ones, it is called a Fig. 31. 
Square. 

If all the Sides are not equal, but the four Angles right ones, it is called an oblong, right Fig. 32. 
angled Parallelogram, or fimply a Rectangle. 

A right Line drawn in a Parallelogram, from one of the Angles to the oppofite one, is 
called a Diagonal ; as the Line AJ3. 

If the four Sides be equal, and alfo the oppofite Angles, but not right ones, it is called a Fig. 33. 
Rhombus, or Lozange. 

If two oppofite of the four Sides are equal, and the oppofite Angles alfo equal, but not 
right ones, the quadrilateral Figure is called a Rhomboides. Fig. 34. 

Alfo a Square is equiangular and equilateral ; an Oblong is equiangular, but not equila- 
teral ; a Rhombus is equilateral, but not equiangular : 
And a Rhombodies is neither equilateral nor equiangular. 

Every quadrilateral Figure, that hath neither its Oppofite Sides, Parallel, or Equal, is Fig. 35. 
called a Trapezium. 

A Circle is a plane Figure, comprehended under one Line, which is called its Circumfe- Fig. 36. 
rence, which is equally diftant from a Point in the middle, called the Center. 

A Semicircle is a Figure terminated by the Diameter and the Semicircumference. Pi gi 37# 

A Portion, or Segment of a Circle, isa Figure comprehended by a part of the Circumfe- 
rence, and a Chord leffer than the Diameter j there is a greater and letter Segment.

A Softer of a Circle is a Figure made by apart of a Circle, terminated by two Radii, or 
Semidiameters, which do not make a right Line •, there is a great and imall Sector. 

An Ellipfis is a Figure longer than it is broad, comprehended but by one Curve Line, in 
which the * two greateft Lines that can be drawn at right Angles to one another, are called 
the Axes of the Ellipfis •, the greateft of which is called the great Axis, and the leficr the 
lead Axis. 

The Center of an Ellipfis is that Point wherein the two Axes cut each other. 

Thole Figures that have the lame Center, are called Concentrick Figures. 

Excentrick Figures are thofe that have not the fame Center. 

Similar Figures are thofe which have their Angles equal each to each ; that is, which have 
each Angle of one Figure equal to the correspondent Angle in the other Figure, and have 
the Sides about the equal Angles proportional. As fuppofe the Side a b is one half, or one 
third of the Side A B ; then all the other Sides of the lefTcr Figure abed, will be likewife 
one half, or one third of the Sides of the greater Figure ABCD. 

The correfpondent Sides in this Figure are calied homologous Sides •, as the Side A B of 
the greater Figure, and the Side a b of the lefler Figure, are called homologous Sides. 

Equal Figures are thofe that equally contain an equal Number of equal Quantities. 

There are Figures that are fimiliar and equal. 

Others are equal, and not fimilar \ 

And, finally, others are fimilar, but not equal. 

Ifoperimetrical Figures are thofe whofe Circuits are equal : As, for Example, the Trian- 
gle ABC, and the Square ABCD, are Ifoperimetrical Figures •, becatife each Side of the 
Triangle being 8, its Circuit is 24, and every Side of the Square being 6, its Circuit is alfo 
24 of thofe equal Parts that make the Circuit of the Triangle. 

Body, or a Solid, is that which hath Length, Breadth, and Thicknefs. 

A Sphere, Globe, or Ball, is made by the entire Revolution of a Semicircle about its 
Diameter, which is at Reft, and which is called the Sphere's Axis. 

A Spheroid is a Solid, made by the entire Revolution of a Semi-Ellipfis about its Axis re- 
maining at Reft. 

A Pyramid is a Solid contained under Several Triangular Planes meeting in one Point, and 
having a Polygon for its Bafe. 

A Cone is a Species of a Pyramid, having a circular Bafe : This Solid is made by the en- 
tire Revolution of a right-angled Triangle about one of the Sides, forming the right An- 
gle, which Side is called the Axis of the Cone. 

A Cylinder is a Solid, whofe Bafes are two equal Circles. This Solid is generated by the 
entire Revolution of a right angled Parallelogram about one of its Sides, which is called 
the Cylinder's Axis. 

A Prifm is a Solid, whofe two Bafes are two fimilar, equal, and parallel Planes ; and when 
the parallel Planes are Triangles, the Prifm is called a Triangular Prifm. 

When the two Bafes of a Prifm are Parallelograms, it is called a Parallelepipedon. 

If the Sides of the aforefaid Bodies are perpendicular to the Bafe, they are called right, 
or Ifofceles Solids. 

If they are inclined, they are called Oblique, or Scalenous Solids. 

A regular Body is that which is contained under regular and equal Figures, all the folid 
Angles of which are likewife equal. 

A folid Angle is the meeting of feveral Planes in one Point ; as the Point of a Diamond. 

There are required more than two Planes to conftitute a folid Angle. 

There are five regular Bodies reprefented in the fame Plate, together with the Unfoldings 
of their Planes, viz. 

The Tetrahedron, contained under four equal and equilateral Triangles. 

The Hexahedron, or Cube, contained under fix equal Squares. 

The Octahedron is contained under eight equal and equilateral Triangles. 

The Dodecahedron, contained under twelve equilateral and equal Pentagons. 

The Icofahedron, contained under twenty equal and equilateral Triangles. 

The Unfoldings nigh to each of the aforenamed regular Bodies, fhew how to draw 
them on Brafs or Pafteboard, in order to cut them out ; which when done, if they are duly 
folded up, there will be formed the regular Bodies. 

All other Solids are called by the general Name of Polyhedron, which Signifies a Body 
terminated by many Superficies. 

If in the following Work, Terms be ufed that are not here defined, they fhall be defined 
and explained in their proper Places.

O/* //&amp;£ ConflruSiion and Ufe of Mathematical Inftru- 
ments $ containing the common Inftruments, as Com- 
pares, the Ruler, the Drawing-Pen, the Porte-Craion 
or Pencil-Holder, the Square, and the Protractor. 







CHAP. I. 

Of the Conflru&amp;ion and Ufe of the CompafTes, the Ruler, the Drawing- 
Pen, and the Porte-Craion or Pencil-holder. 

HERE are feveral Sorts of Compafles, of which we fhall fpeak more 
fully hereafter ; but that whofe Ufes we intend to lay down in this Chap- 
ter, is the common Pair of Compafifes. Of thefe Compafles there are two 
kinds, viz. Simple Ones, which have their Points fixed, and others whofe 
Points may be taken off; both kinds being of different Bigneffes, but they 
are commonly in Length from three to fix Inches. To thefe Compafles, 
that fhift their Points, there belongs a Drawing- Pen-Point, a Pencil-Point, 
and fometimes a Dotting- Wheel, to make dotted Lines. 
The Goodnefs of Compafles confifts chiefly in this, That the Motion of their Head be 
very equable, that fo they may not leap in opening and fliutting i that the Joints be well 
fitted ; that they are well filed and polifhed -, and, laftly, that the Steel-Points are well 
joined and equal. The Figure A fheweth thefe kinds of Compafles, whofe Conftruction we Fig. A. 
Ihall give in the third Book. 

Rulers, which are of Brafs, or Wood, ought to be very flrait every way ; they are made Fig B. 
ftrait with Files and a Planner, whofe Bottom is Steel ; as alfo by rubbing them and another 
very ftrait Ruler together : one Side of thefe Rulers is floped, to keep the Ink from blot- 
ting the Paper. 

When Lines are drawn with Ink, they ought to be very fine. 

To know whether a Ruler be very ftrait or not, draw a right Line upon a Plane ; then 
turn the Ruler about, and apply the fame Edge to the Line ; and if the Edge of the Ruler 
cxaclly agrees with the right Line, it is a Sign the Ruler is very ftrait. 

The Drawing-Pen is made of two Steel Blades joined together, and fattened to a little 
Pillar, at the other End of which is a Porte-Craion •, there is a Cavity between the aforefaid Fig. C. 
Blades, in which Ink is put with a Pen : alfo the Blades muft join each other in Points that 
be very equal. There is likewife a fmall Screw, ferving more or lefs to open the Blades, 
that fo Lines may be drawn fine or coarfe, according to neceflity. 

The Porte-Craion ought to be of equal Bignefs every where, and very ftraitly flit down 
the middle with a fine Saw ; alfo the Porte-Craion is bent towards the- end, in order to 
fallen a Pencil in it, by means of a little Ring. 

C USE 



6 Of the Confiruciion and Ufe Book I. 

USE I. To divide a right Line into two equal Parts. 

pr , J .a the given Line be A B, which is to be divided into two equal Parts: About the 

Point A, as a Center, or one of the Ends of the Line, defcribe the circular Arc C D, with 

' Z ' your Compaffes opened to any Diftance, but neverthelefs greater than one half of A B. Like- 

wife about the other end B, as a Center, defcribe, with the fame Opening of your Com- 
pares, the circular Arc E F, cutting the former Arc in the Points G H ; then place a Ruler 
upon thefe two Interferons, and draw the Line G H, which will divide the Line AB into 
two equal Parts. 

Note, The two Arcs will not interfeft each other, if the Opening of the Compaffes be not 
greater than half of the given Line. 

USE II. Upon a right Line, and from a Point give in it, to raife a Perpendicular. 

Pj z Let the given right Line be A B, and the Point given in it C, upon which it is required 

to raife a Perpendicular. 

From the given Point C, mark both ways with your Compaffes, on the given Line, the 
equal Diftances C A, CB; then about the Points A 13, as Centers, and with any opening of 
your Compaifes' (greater than half the given Line) defcribe the Arcs D E, FG, interacting 
each other in the Point H, and draw the Line HC, which will be perpendicular to A B. 

i'ig. 3. If the given Point C be at the End of the Line, defcribe about the Point C, as a Centre, 

any Arc of a Circle-, on which take twice the fame opening of your Compafles, viz. from 
B to D, and from D to E : then about the Points D, E, defcribe two Arcs, interfering one 
another in the Point F •, lay a Ruler upon the Points F and C, and draw the Line F C, 
which will be a Perpendicular upon the End of the Line CB. 

If there is not room to take the Length of D E, divide the Arc B D in two equal Parts 
in the Point G, and make D H equal toDG; then the Line FI C will be a Perpendicular. 

;..-j„ 4. Or otherwife, having drawn the indefinite Line B D F, through the Points D, F, and 

made D F equal to B D •, F C will be a Perpendicular. 

Flcy Or again in this Manner : having taken the Point P at pleafure above the given Line, 

about the faid Point, as a Center •, and with the Interval P C, defcribe the Arc BCD, then 
draw the Line BP, and produce it 'till it cuts the aforefaid'Arc in the Point D, and from 
the Point D to the Point C, draw the Perpendicular D C. 

USE III. From a Point given without a Line, to let fall a Perpendicular to the /aid Line. 

Let the given Point be C, from which, to the given Line A B, it is required to draw a 
Perpendicular. 
Fig. 6. About the Point C, as a Center, defcribe an Arc of a Circle cutting the Line A B in the 

two Points D E ; then from the Points D E, make the Interferon F •, lay a Ruler upon the 
Points C and F, and draw the Perpendicular C G. 

Note, The Interferon F may be made above or below the given Line ; but it is bed to 
have it below it ; becaufe when the Points C F are at a good Diftance, the Perpendicular 
may be drawn truer than when they are nigh. 

When the Portion of the Circle defenbed about the Point C, does not cut the Line A B 
in two Points, the Line muft be continued if it can ; if it cannot, Recourfe muft be had to the 
Method of Fig. 5. for raifing a Perpendicular on the End of a Line : as fuppofe a Perpen- 
dicular is to be let fall from the Point D, on the Line CD, draw, at pleafure, the Line 
D B, which bifect in the Point P ; then about this Point, as a Centre,- and with the Diftance 
PD, defcribe the Arc DCB, cutting the Line AB in the Point C. Laftly, lay a Ruler 
upon the Points C and D, and draw the Line C D, which will be the Perpendicular required. 
Fig. 7. Otherwife, let A B be the given Line, and C the Point without it \ take two Points 1 

and 2 at pleafure, on the the faid Line A B •, then about the Points 1 and 2, and with the 
Diftances 1 C, 2 C, defcribe Arcs of Circles, interfering each other in two Points, as in 
C and D ; then lay a Ruler on the two Interferons, and draw a Line, which will be the 
Perpendicular required. 

USE IV. To cut a right-lined Angle into two equal Parts. 

Let A C B be the Angle to be cut into two equal Parts. 
p,„ g About the Point C, as a Center, defcribe the Arc DE at pleafure; then about the Points 

D and E, defcribe two other Arcs, cutting each other in the Point F, and draw the Line F C 
through the Points F, C, which will cut the given Angle into two equal Parts. 

If it be required to divide the Angle A CB into three equal Parts, the Arc D E muft ten- 
tatively be divided by your Compaffes into three equal Parts* ; becaufe the Triferion of an 
Angle by right Lines, hath not yet been geometrically found. 

USE 



* Our Author fhould have faid here, becaufe the Trifeclion of an Angle cannot be geometrically performed by 
right Lines or Circles either. See more particularly how to do thi-j in the Appendix. 



Chap. i. of the Compaffes , the Ruler , &amp;c. 7 

U S E V. To raife a right Line on a given Line, that may incline no more on 

one Side than the other. 

Make the fame Operation as before, and produce the Line F C G. Fig. 8. 

USE VI. Upon a given right Line, and from a Point given in it, to make 

an Angle equal to a given Angle. 

Let A B be the given Line, and A the given Point upon which it is required to make an 
Angle equal to the given Angle E F G. 

About the Point F, as a Center, defcribe the Portion of a Circle; and with the fame Fig 9, 
opening of your Compaffes, defcribe about the Point A another Portion ; then take the Big- 
ntfs of the Arc E G between your Compaffes, which Diftance lay off on the Arc B C : now 
through the Points A, C, draw the Line A C, and the Angle B A C will be equal to the Angle 
EFG. 

USE VII. To draw a Line from a given Point, parallel to a given Line. 

Let A B be the given Line, and C the Point through which it is required to draw a Line 
parallel to A B. 

About the Point C, as a Center, and with any opening of your Compaffes, taken at plea- 
fure, defcribe the Arc D B cutting the given Line in the Point B : alfo about the fame Pojnt Fig- i°. 
B, as a Center, and with the fame opening of your Compaffes, defcribe the Arc C A •, then 
take the Diftance of the Points C, A, and lay it off from B to D, and through the Points 
C and D, draw the Line CD, which Will be parallel to A B. 

Otherwife, about the Point C, as a Center, defcribe an Arc touching the given Line •, 
and about another Point, taken at pleafure in the Line A B, defcribe, with the fame opening Fig. 11. 
of your Compaffes, the Arc D : then through the Point C, draw a Line touching the Arc D, 
and the Line C D will be parallel to A B. 

But as it is difficult to find whereabouts the Point of Contact will be, there is another way 
which is better, and is thus : ■» 

About the Point C, as a Center, and with any Diftance, defcribe an Arc cutting the Line Fig 12. 
A Bin A. 

And about another Point in the fame Line, as B, defcribe another Arc, with the fame 
opening of your Compaffes ; then open the Compaffes to the Diftance A B, and about the 
Point C, as a Center, defcribe an Arc cutting the former one in the Point D •, and through 
the Points C and D draw a Line, which will be parallel to A B. 

USE VIII. To divide a given Line into any number of equal Parts. 

Let the Line given be A B, which is required to be divided into eight equal Parts : firfl, Fig. J 3- 
draw the Line B C, at pleafure, making any Angle with the Line A B. Likewife draw the 
Line A D parallel toBC; then divide B C into eight equal Parts, taken at pleafure, and 
make the fame Parts on the Line A D, and through the Divifions of them, draw Lines, which 
will divide the Line A B into eight equal Parts. 

Or otherwife, draw the Line a b parallel to A B, which is propofed to be divided; then Fig. 14. 
take 8 equal Parts on the Line ab. Now through the Ends of the two Parallels draw two 
Lines, which form Triangles with the Parallels, and interfect each other in the Point C ; 
then from the Point C, draw Lines to the Divifions made on the Line a b, which will cut 
the Line AB in the Number of equal Parts required. 

This Divifion of Lines ferves to make Diagonal Scales •, as fuppofe the Line A B is to 
make a Scale of eighty Parts, or eighty Fathom ; each Part of this Line, divided into eight, Fig. ;;, 
contains ten Fathom: but fince it is difficult to divide each of the aforefaid Parts into ten 
others, you muft raife from the Ends of the Line A B, the Perpendiculars AD and B C, on 
which take ten Parts at pleafure ; from every of which, you muft draw Parallels to the Line 
A B ; then the fame Divifions muft be made on the Line DC, as on A B ; and the tranf- 
verfal Lines A E, 10 F, 20 G, &amp;c. muft be drawn. 

Now it is eafy to take off any Number of Fathoms from this Scale: as, for Example, to 
take off 23 Fathoms •, Take the Concourfe of the Tranfverfal 20 G, with the Parallel 3, that 
is at the Point Z, and Z 3 will be 23 Fathom. Moreover, if 58 Fathom is required, take 
the Concourfe of the Tranfverfal 50 H, with the Parallel 8, which is Y, and Y 8 will repre- 
ftnt 58 Fathom, and fo of others. Feet might be put upon this Scale, by making a greater 
Diftance between the Parallels; and by fub-dividing them into 12 equal Parts, there would 
be obtained Inches. 

But now to divide a very fhort Line into a great Number of equal Parts, as into 100 or 
1000: For Example; Suppofe the Line A D is to be divided into 1000 equal Parts ; firft, Fig. 16. 
from the Ends A D, raife the Perpendiculars A B, DC, and divide each of thefe Perpendi- 
culars into 10 equal Parts, and draw through the Divifions the like Number of Parallels to A D; 
then divide e?.ch of the Lines A D, BC, into 10 equal Parts, which join by the like Num- 
ber of Perpendiculars. Again, fubdivide the firft Space A E, and it's Parallel, into 10 more 
Parts, which join by tranfverfal or oblique Lines, as the Line E 1, &amp;c. 

By 



8 Of the ConjlruEiion and Ufe Book I. 

By this Means the firft Interval AE, will be divided into 100 equal Parts ;, for which Rea- 
fon, the Numbers 200, 300, 400, 500, &amp;c. to 1000, are placed on this Scale, as may be 
ken in Fig. 16. 

The Manner of taking off any Number of equal Parts from the aforefaid Scale, is the 
fame as that which hath been already fhewn in the precedent Figure. We mall again men- 
tion this Scale in the Chapter of the Sector. There are alfo Sines, Tangents, and Secants, 
projected upon Scales, in the following Manner: If from each Degree of the Quadrant I F, 
beo-innin^ from the Point I, Perpendiculars are let fall to the Radius A I, thefe will be the 
Sines of each Degree, the greateft of which is the Radius of the Circle, or Sinus Totus A F 5 
and the Lengths of all thefe Sines may be projected upon the Radius, in order to make a 
Scale, beginning from the Point A-, as the Sine DK is laid off from A towards G, csV. 

And if the Tangent I E, be indefinitely produced towards E, and from the Center A, 
Fig. 1 7. Lines, as A E, be drawn through each Degree of the Quadrant, to the Tangent I E produced, 

thefe will be the Secants of each Degree of the Quadrant. Whence it is manifelf, that any 
one of the Secants is greater than the Radius A I. It is likewife plain, that every Tangent 
I E, is terminated by it's Secant A E, in the Line I E, which will be a Scale of Tangents : 
and it is in this manner, that the fimple Scales of Sines, Tangents, and Secants, are made in 
takino- between your Compaffes each of thofe Diftances, and laying them off upon a Ruler. 
The Tables of Sines, Tangents, and Secants, are likewife made on this Principle : for the 
Radius of a Circle, or Sine of a right Angle, is fuppofed to be divided into 10000, and then 
there is found how many of thefe Parts every right Sine contains ; as alfo the Tangents and 
Secants from one Minute to 90 Degrees ; which, when put in order, are called the Tables 
of Sines, Tangents, and Secants. 

Logarithms are Numbers in an Arithmetical Progreffion, to which anfwer other Numbers 
in a Geometrical Progreffion, as the two following Progreffions. 

Prog. Geom. Numb. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, &amp;c. 

Prog. Arith. Log. o, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. Logarithms were invented 
to perform Multiplication by only the help of Addition, and Divifion by Subtraction •, by 
which Operations are infinitely fhortened, and fo they are of excellent Ufe in Agronomical 
Calculations. 

Note., The Ufe of thefe Tables is explained in Books of the Tables of Sines, Tangents, 
and Secants. 

USE IX. To cut off from a given Line any Part ajfgned. 

Let the Line A B be the given Line from which it is required to cut off the fourth Part. 
Fig. 18. Draw the indefinite Line AC, making any Angle with the Line A B, which divide into 

four equal Parts at pleafure •, then from the Jaft Divifion, draw the Line B 4, and afterwards 
the Line D I, parallel to B 4, which will be a fourth Part of A B. 

U S E X. To draw a right Line through a given Point, that Jhall touch a Circle. 

If the given Point be in the Circumference, draw the Radius A B, and on the Point B 
raife the Perpendicular B C, which will be a Tangent in the Point B. But if the given 
/'ig. 19.&amp;20. Point B be without the Circle, draw a right Line from the Center A, to the PoinfB, which 
bifect in the Point D : then about the faid Point D, as a Center, and with the Diftance B D, 
defcribe a Semi-Circle cutting the Circle in the Point E, and draw B E, which will be a 
Tangent. 

If a Circle be given with it's Tangent, and the Point of Contact be required, let fall the 
Perpendicular A B from the Center of the Circle, and the Interferon of the Tangent with 
the faid Perpendicular, will be in the Point of Contract. 

USE XI. Upon a given Line to defcribe a Spiral, making any Number of Revolutions. 

Let the given Line be A B, upon which it is required to defcribe a Spiral of 3 Revolutions. 
Firft, bifect that Line in the Point C, about which Point, as a Center, defcribe a Semi- 
Circle, whofe Diameter may be equal to the given Line A B; then trifect the Semi-Diame- 
Fig. zi, ter A C in the Points DE, and about the fame Center defcribe, on the fame Side the Line 

A B, two other Semi-Circles paffing through the Points D E : again, fubdivide the Space 
C E, into two equal Parts in the Point F ; about which, as a Center, defcribe on the other 
Side of the given Line, three other Semi-Circles, and a Spiral of three Revolutions will be had. 
If the Spiral is required to make four Revolutions, you muft divide the Semi-Diameter A C 
into 4 equal Parts *. 

USE XII. Num. I. Upon a given right Line, to defcribe an equilateral Triangle. 

Let A B be the given Line on which it is required to defcribe an equilateral Triangle. 
Fig. 22. About the Point A, and with the Diftance A B, defcribe an Arc of a Circle; and about 

the Point B, as a Center, with the Diftance B A, defcribe another Arc cutting the precedent 
one in the Point C ; then draw the Lines C A, C B ; and the Triangle ABC, will be an 
equilateral Triangle. 

USE 

* Although this is called a Spiral, yet in reality, it is only fever a I unequal Semi-Circles ; of no manner of ufe ist 
mnj geometrical Ejftfiion, a Spiral being vajily different. See the Appendix.

another fmall Arc cutting the former one in the Point C. Draw AC and B C, then will die 
Triangle ABC be an lib feel les Triangle, defcribed upon the given Bafe A B, and having 
either of its equal Legs AC, B C of a given Length. 
USE XIII. Upon a given right Line, to make a Triangle equal and fimiiar to a given one. 

Let the given Triangle be A B C, to which it is required to make another fimiiar, as Fig. 24. 
D E F. and 2 5 # 

Make the Line D E equal to AE; then about the Point D, as a Center, and with the 
Radius AC defcribe an Arc -, alfo about the Point E, as a Center, and with the Radius BC 
defcribe another Arc, cutting the former one in the Point F; then draw the Lines D F,

USE XIV. Upon a given right Line to make a Triangle fimiiar to a given one. 

Let the given Line be HI, upon which it is required to make a Triangle fimiiar (but Fig. 26. 

nor. equal) to the Triangle A B C. and 2 ?' 

IVhke the ngle ii equal to the Angle B, and the A,ngle I equal to the Angle A •, then 

draw th ■ Lines H G, I G, 'till they meet each other, and the Triangle H IG will be that 

required. 

USE XV. To make a Triangle of three right Lines given j but any two of them mufi be 

longer than lbs third. 

Let the three given Lines be A, B, C •, firft make the Line D E equal to the Line A, and Fig. 2E, 
about the Point E as a Center, with an Interval, equal to the Line B, defcribe thf- Portion 
of a Circle; alfo about D, as a Center, with an Interval equal to C, defcribe another Por- 
tion of a Circle, cutting rhe former one in the Point E j then draw the right Lines FD, F E, 
and the Triangle U F E will be that required. 

USE XVI. Upon a given right Line to make a Square. 

Let the given Line be A B, on which it is required to defcribe a Square, whofe Side Fig. 29, 
may be equal to the given Line, firft about the Point A, as a Center ; and with the Diftance 
A B, defcribe the Arc BD, and about the Point B the Arc A E, interfering it in the Point 
C, and divide the Arc C A, or C B, into two equal Parts in the Point F: now make the 
Intervals C E, and C D, equal to C F, and draw the Lines A D, ^ E, D E, and the Square 
will be made. 

Or, otherwife, upon the End of the Line AT, raife the Perpendicular AD equal to A B, 
and about the Point D, as a Center, with the Diftance A D, defcribe an Arc ; likewife, Fig. 30. 
with the fame Opening of your Compaffes about the Point B, defcribe another Arc, and 31. 
cutting the fir ft in the Point E, and draw the Lines AD, D E, E B, and the Square will be 
made. 

I flial! fhew, in the Ufes of the Protractor and Sector, how to make any regular Polygon 
upon a given Line ; but, by the way, I fhall give one general Method for conftru&amp;ing them, 
by means only of a Ruler and Compaffes. 

USE XVII. To inferibe any regular Polygon in a Circle. 

Suppofe, for Example, a Pentagon is to be made: Now if the Circle be given, divide it's 
Diameter into five equal Parts (by Ufe VIII.), but if it be not given, draw with your Pencil 
an indefinite Line for a Diameter-, which being divided into five equal Parts, open your Fig. 32. 
Compaffes the whole Extent of the Diameter, and fetting one Foot of them upon the Ends 
of the Diameter, defcribe two Arcs interfering each other in the Point C, that thereby an 
equilateral Triangle may be formed ; then having drawn a Circle about the Diameter, lay a 
Ruler upon the laid Point C, and upon the fecond Divifion of the Diameter, and draw a 
Line, cutting the concave Part of the Circumference in the Point D •, then the Arc A D will 
be nighly a fifth Part of the Circumference : therefore the Extent A D will divide the Circle 
into five equal Parts, and drawing five Lines, the propofed Polygon will be made. 

This is a general Method to make all regular Polygons : As, to make a Heptagon, there 
is no more to do but divide the Diameter A B into ieven equal Parts (that is, into as many 
Parts as the Figure hath Sides), and always drawing a Line from the Point C, thro' the fe- 
Cor.d Divifion of the Diameter. 

The Conftruction of a Hexagon is fimpler •, becaufe, without any Preparation, the Radius, 
or Semidiameter of the Circle, will divide the Circumference into fix equal Parts. 

And the Dodecagon is made in only bifecting each Arc of the Hexagon ; therefore to make 
a Decagon, every Arc of the Pentagon muft be bifeded. 

This Problem is almoft the fame as that defcribed in cap. 17. lib. 1. of the Chevalier de 
Pille's Fortification, except, that for dividing the Circle, he draws a Line from the exterior 
Angle of the equilateral Triangle, thro' the firft Point of Divifion of the Diameter, and af- 

D terwards 



io Of the Conflruclion and Ufe Book I. 

terwards he doubles the Arc of the Circle ; but his Method is far from being exadt : for, in 
the Defcription of a Pentagon, the Angle at the Center is too great by forty-four Minutes ; 
in the Heptagon, it is too great one Degree and five Minutes •, and fo the Error will be aug- 
mented in Polygons of a greater number of Sides. But by making the Line pafs thro' the 
fecond Point of Divifion of the Diameter, the Angle at the Center of the Pentagon will be buc 
about fix Minutes too little, and in the Heptagon it is too great by about fix Minutes ; 
which are much lefs Errors, and almoft infenfible in the Defcription of the Polygons. 

The Truth of the aforefaid Method of infcribing any regular Polygon in a Circle, which is 
mentioned in Sturmy'j- Mathefis Enucleata, may, by the help of "Trigonometry, be eaftly ex- 
amined. For, fuppofe A C G to be a Circle, D the Center, A C the Diameter, A B C an 
equilateral Triangle, E the fecond Point of Divifion of the Diameter divided into any Number 
cf equal Parts, B F drawn thro" the Points B, E, Fig. 33. D B perpendicular to A C, arid 
the Points D, F, joined: Now becaufe the Semidiameter DC, and the whole Diameter BC 
are given, the Perpendicular DB (per Prop. 47. lib. 1. Eucl.) will be had. 

Again, becaufe the Number of equal Parts the Diameter is divided into, is given, the Line 
C E, which is two of thofe equal Parts, will be given, and confequently the Part D E ; 
then in the right-angled Triangle B D E, the Sides B D, D E being given, the Angle D B E 
may be found, by faying, as D B is to D E, fo is Radius to the Tangent of the Angle 
DBE. 

Moreover, becaufe in the Triangle B D F, the Sides D B, and D F (equal to D C), are 
given, and the Angle F B D (which is now found), the Angle B F D may be fonnd, by faying^ 
as D F is to D B, fo is the Sine of the Angle DBF, to the Sine of the Angle DFli: 
which being found, add it to the Angle DBF, and fubflracl the Sum from 180 Degrees ; 
then the Remainder will be the Angle B D F, from which take the right Angle B D C, and 
the Remainder will be the Angle F D C of the Center of the Polygon. 

I have calculated, according to the aforefaid Directions, the Quantity of the Angle F D C 
for a Pentagon, which I find to want about 14 Minutes of 72 Degrees, the Angle of the 
Center for a Pentagon (though our Author fays it wants but fix), likewife the Hexagon wants 
1 2 Minutes of 60 Degrees, the Angle at the Center ; that of the Oblagon is one Degree too 
great, and that of the Dodecagon 29 Minutes too great : therefore this Method is very errone- 
ous, and not to be ufed ; it being only true for inferibing a Square. 

USE XVIII. To draw a Circle thro* three given Prints, provided they be not in a 

right Line. 
Fig, 34, Let the given Points be A, B, C: firft draw a Line from the Point A to the Point B, and 

another from the Point B to the Point C-, both of which divide into two equal Parts by the 
Lines D E, F G, drawn at right Angles to them, and meeting each other in the Point H, 
which will be the Center of the Circle : Now about the Point H as a Center, and with the 
Diftance HA, H B, or H C, defcribe a Circle, and what was required will be done. 

By this means the Circumference of a Circle begun, may be finifhed, in taking three Points 
in it, and proceeding as before. 

USE XIX. To find the Center of a Circle. 
Fig. 35. Let A B D be the given Circle, whofe Center is required to be found ; draw the Line A B, 

which bifect by the Line C D at right Angles : likewife bifect the Line B D by the Line 
E F, cutting the Line C D in the Point G, which will be the Center of the Circle. 

USE XX. To draw a right Line equal to the Circumference of a Circle -, and, contrari- 

wife, to make the Circumference of a Circle equal to a given Line. 

Let the given Circle A B C D be that whofe Circumference it is required to make a right 

Line equal to: Firft draw a right Line, and lay off upon it three times and 4 of the Dia- 

Pig 36. meter, as from G to H ; then this right Line G H will be almoft equal to the Circumference 

of the Circle : I fay almoft -, for if it could be exactly had equal to the Circumference, the 

Quadrature of the Circle would alfo be had *, which hath not yet been Geometrically found. 

USE XXI. To defcribe an Oval upon a given right Line. 
Let AB be the given Line, upon which it is required to defcribe an Oval; trifect it in 
the Points C and D •, then upon the Part C D defcribe two equilateral Triangles, whofe Sides 
Fig. ,« produce-, and about the Points C, D, with the Diftance C A, or D B, defcribe Portions of a 

Circle to the Sides of the Triangles, produced to the Points E, F, G, FI ; then about the 
Points I, K, as Centers, and with the Radius I E, or I G, defcribe the Arc E G on one Side, 
and the Arc F H en the other, and the Oval will be made. Note, This is not properly an 
Oval, but fomething like one. 

USE XXII. To defcribe an Ellipfis, having the two Axes given. 
Let the great Axis be AB, and the fmall one CD, interfecting each other at right Angles 
in the Point G. 

Firft 

* No, nor never v-itt, it being impojjil/le to be done, 



Chap. I. of the CoMpaffes, the Ruler, &amp;c. II 

Firft take with your Compafles, or a String, half the Length of the great Axis, that is* 
AG, or G B -, and with this Length fetting one foot of your Compafles in the Point C, de- Fig. 38 
fcribe a Circle cutting the great Axis in the Points E, F, which will be the Foci of the Ellip- 
fis. This being done, place Pins in thefe Foci ; or, if the Ellipfis to be defcribed be re- 
quired large, and to be on the Ground, as ih a Garden, drive Pegs into them : Then take 
a Thread, or String, equal in Length to the great Axis A B, and after having doubled it, 
put it about the two Pins or Pegs placed in the Foci E, F ; fo that the two Ends which you 
hold in your Hand may be in the End C of the fmall Axis : then holding a Pencil, or fome- 
thing elfe proper to make a Mark, in your Hand at C, move it round, keeping the String 
always tight, 'till it, together with the Ends of the Thread or String, comes again to the 
Point C, and the Ellipfis ADBC will % be defcribed by the Pencil. 

Note, This Method of defcribing an Ellipfis is the bed of any ; as alfo if the Thread, or 
String be in Length augmented or diminifhed, without changing the Diftance of the Foci, 
there will be had Ellipfes of another kind. Moreover, if without changing the Length of 
the Thread, or String, the Diftance of the Foci be diminifhed, there will ftill be had another 
Species of Ellipfes •, and when the Foci's Diftance is infinitely diminifhed, a Circle will be 
defcribed : But if the Length of the great Axis be augmented or diminifhed, together with 
the String (which is equal to it), in the fame Proportion as the Diftance of the Foci, all" the 
Ellipfes will be fimilar, but of different Magnitudes. 

'To draw an Eliipjis another way. 

The two Foci E, F, being found (as in the precedent Figure), any Number of Points, 
thro' which the Ellipfis mult pafs, may in this manner be found. Open your Compafles at 
pleafure to any Diftance greater than A F, as to the Diftance A I ; then fet one of their 
Points in the Focus F, and with the other defcribe the Arc O R ; afterwards open the Com- Fig. 351* 
pafles the Diftance I B, which is the remaining part of the great Axis, and fetting one of 
it's Points in the other Focus E, with the Diftance I B defcribe the Arc S T, and the Point 
P of InterfecYion will be in the Periphery of the Ellipfis. In like manner, the Diftances A L, 
L B, defcribed about the Foci, will interfedt each other in the Point hi : and, finally, by 
opening your Compafles to different Diftances, any Number of Points may be found •, which 
being joined, an Ellipfis will be had. 

Note, Every Opening of your Compafles ferves to find four Points equally diltant from the 
Axes i as alfo if, from any Point taken at pleafure in the Periphery of an Ellipfis, two right 
Lines, as P F, P E, are drawn to the Focij thefe will be both together equal to the great Axis. 

USE XXIII. To make one Figure equal and fimilar to another Figure. 

Let the propofed Figure be A B C D E, to which another is to be made fimilar and equal. 

Firft divide it into Triangles by the Lines AC, AD; then draw the Line a b equal to 
A B ; and about the Point b, with the Diftance B C, defcribe an Arc : alfo about the Point &lt;z, p^ 4 a. 
and with the Diftance A C, defcribe another Arc, cutting the former one in the Point c, and 
draw the Line b c : In like manner proceed for the other Sides, and the Figure a b c de will 
be fimilar to the propofed Figure A B C D E. 

USE XXIV. To reduce great Figures to lejfer ones, and contrariwise. 

Becaufe the Reduction of Figures is ufeful, there is here three ways given to reduce them. 

Firft, a Figure may be reduced in taking a Point within it, and drawing of Lines to all the Fig. 41* 
Angles : for Example, let the Figure A B C D E be propofed to be reduced to a lefler. 

Take the Point F, about the middle of the Figure, and draw Lines to all the Angles 
ABCDE; then draw the Line a b parallel to the Line A B, the Line b c parallel to B C, 
&amp;c and the Figure a b c d e will be fimilar to the Figure ABCDE. 

If a greater figure be required, there is no more to do but produce the Lines drawn from 
the Center of the Figure, and then drawing Parallels to it's Sides. 

To reduce a Figure by the Scale. 

Meafure all the Sides of the propofed Figure ABCDE, with the Scale G H $ then take 
another lefler Scale K L, containing as many equal Parts as the greater. Now make the Side Fig. 42. 
a b as many Parts of the lefler Scale, as the Side A B contains of the greater one's Parts $ 
alfo make b c as many Parts as B C, and a c as many as A C, &amp;c. by which means the Fi- 
gure will be reduced to a lefler one. 

To reduce a lefler Figure to a greater one, a greater Scale muft be had, and proceed as 
before. 

To reduce Figures by the Angle of Proportion. 

Let the propofed Figure A B C D E be that which is to be diminifhed in the proportion 
of the Line A B, to the Line a b. 

Firft draw the indefinite Line G H, and take the Length A B, and lay off from GtoHj Fig. 43. 
then about the Point G, defcribe the Arc H I. Again, take the Length of the given Side 
abj as a Chord of the Arc H I, draw the Line G I, and the Angls I G H will give all the 
Sides of the Figure to. be reduced. 

■liw 



12 Of the Gonftruciim and Ufe Book I. 

As to have the Point c, take the Interval B C, and about the Point G defcribe the Arc KL ; 
alfo about the Point b, with the Diftance LK, defcribe a fmall Arc. Now take the Diftance A C, 
and about the Point G defcribe the Arc M N ; likewife about the Point a, with the Diftance 
MN, defcribe an Arc, cutting the precedent one in the Point c, which will be that which mud 
be had to draw the Side be: in like manner proceed for all the other Sides and Angels of the 
Figure. 

If by this means a fmall Figure is to be reduced to a greater, the fame manner of pro- 
ceeding will do it; but the Side of the Figure to be augmented muft be leffer than double 
of that anfwering to it. As for Example -, to reduce the Figure a b c d e to a greater, the 
Side A B of the greater one, muft be leffer than double the Side a b of the fmaller one: 
for if it was double, the two Fines forming the Angle I G FI, would directly meet each 
other, and make but one right Line. 

To reduce Figures by means of Squares. 
This way particularly ferves to copy, augment, or diminifh a Map. 
Fig. \\. Let, for Example, the Map A B C D be propofed to be reduced to a leffer one. Fir ft, di- 

vide it into Squares, then make a leffer fimilar Figure a b c d, which likewife divide into the 
fame Number of Squares as you did A BCD. This being done, draw in every Square of 
the leffer Figure, what is contained in the correfpondent Square of the greater Figure, and 
there will be a leffer Map. Note., The greater the Number of Squares are, the jufter will the 
Figure be. 






CHAP. II. 

Of the ConflruSiion and Ufe of the Square, 

Square is an Inftrument ferving to raife Perpendiculars, and to know whether one Line 
be perpendicular to another. It is made of two Rulers of Brafs, or other Metal, joined 
Fig. D. in fuch manner as to make a right Angle with each other. There are fome Squares, whole 

two Rulers, or Branches, are firmly fixed ; and others that open and fruit by help of a Joint, 
that ought to be well fitted to hinder the Square from fhaking •, and that it may preferve it's 
right Angle. To do which, there is adjufted in a fmall Gutter made at the Angle (which is 
45 Degrees) of one of the Branches of the Square, three Knuckh's proportionable in Length 
and Breadth, to the Length and Breadth of the Square. Thefe Knuckles ought to be fo far 
diftant from each other, that they may exactly receive between them two other Knuckles, 
which are adjufted to the other Branch of the Square. The Knuckles being thus placed, 
are foldered to the Branches, and afterwards are united to one anochcr by means of a Pin, 
which muft exactly fill the Cavity of the Knuckles, that thcr: by the Motion of the Branches 
may be fteady. 

Note. There are fome Squares to which a Thread and Plummet is hung, which ferves for 
levelling ; that is, to make horizontal Planes: alfo upon one of the Sides of the Square are 
fometimes fundry Lines and Scales placed ; and upon the other, half a Foot divided into 6 
Inches, every one of which is fubdivided into 12 Lines : moreover, there are fometime3 ad- 
ded to it other Country Meafures compared with the Paris Foot. 

USE I. To let fall from a given Point, a Perpendicular upon a given Line. 
Let the Line given be A B, and C the given Point, either in or without the Line. 
Fig. 45. Apply one °f tne Sides of the Square to the given Line, in fuch manner that the other 

Side touches the given Point •, then draw the lane C D, which will be a Perpendicular. Note, 
If the Square be turned about, and that Side which before was applied to the Line, is made 
to pafs thro' the Point C, and, as before, another Line be drawn, as CD: by this means you 
may know whether the Square be true. For when it is true, the two Lines drawn thro' the 
Point C, will make but one Line. 

USE II. To know if one Line be perpendicular to another ; that is, whether they make 

right singles with each other. 

Apply one of the Sides of the Square to one of the Lines, and fee if the other Side exactly 
agrees with the other Line. All this is fo extreme cafy, there needs but a few words to 
explain it. 

C H A P. III. 

Of the ConftruElion and Ufes of the ProtraStor, 

T\ H E Protractor is a Semi-Circle divided into 180 Degrees, or half of 360, which every 
whole Circle is fuppofed to be divided into, as was laid in the Definitions. One Side 
r; 3 E. of this Inftrument is filed flat, for better applying it on the Piper ; and the other Side is 

Hoped -, 



Chan. 3. of the Protra&amp;or, &amp;c. 13 

floncd ; that is, nude thin towards the Edge whereon the Divifions are : and for better di£ 
covering the Points wherein Angles terminate, there is a fmall femicircular Notch made in the 
Center of the Inftrument. 

How to divide the Limb of the "Protractor. 

Upon the Line A B, and about the Center O, defcribe a Semicircle ; then carry the Ra- 
dius A O round the Circumference, which will divide the Semicircle into three equal Parts, 
in the Points C, D, each of which is 60 Degrees. Again, divide the Arc B C into two equal 
Parts, in the Point E, and the Arc B E, will be 30 Degrees : then turning this Opening of 
your CompafTes round the Semicircle, it will divide it into fix equal Parts. Moreover, divide 
them apain into three equal Parts, and each will be 10 Degrees ; and dividing every one of 
thefe 10 Degrees into two equal Parts more, Arcs of 5 Degrees will be had. And laftly, in 
fubdividing each of thefe Arcs of 5 Degrees, into five equal Parts, Arcs of one Degree will 
be had. 

In the fame manner may a whole Circle be divided into 360 Degrees, which we (hall fpeak 
of hereafter. 

Note, Protractors are fometimes made of Horn, which, becaufe they are tranfparent, are 
commodious enough ; but they ought to be kept in a Book when they are not ufing, becaufe 
the Horn is apt to wrinkle. 

U S E I. To make an Angle of any Number of Degrees. 

For Example ; to make at the Point A, an Angle of 50 Degrees on the Line CAB, lay the 
Center of the Protractor, marked by a femicircular Cavity, upon the Point A, fo that the 
Diameter of the Semicircle be upon the Line A B ; then make a Dot over againft the 50th Fig. 45. 
Degree of the Limb of the Protractor, and thro' it draw a Line to the Point A, which will 
make an Angle of 50 Degrees with the Line A B. 

USE II. The Angle BAD being given, to find how many Degrees it contains. 
Lay the Center of the Protractor upon the Point A, and it's Diameter upon the Line BC; 
then fee what Degree the Line A B cuts the Limb of the Protractor in, which will be the Fig. 46. 
Angle BAD of 50 Degrees. 

U S E III. To infer -'the any regular Polygon in a Circle. 

To do this, you mud firft know how many Degrees the Angle of the Center of each of 
the regular Polygons contains; which may be found in dividing 360 Degrees, by the Num- 
ber of Sides of a propofed Polygon: as, for Example, dividing 360 by 5, the Quotient 72, 
fheweth that the Angle of the Center of a Pentagon is 72 Degrees : again, in dividing 360 
by 8, the Quotient 45, gives the Quantity of the Angle of the Center of an Octagon, and 
fo for others. 

In knowing the Angle of the Center, the Angle formed by the Sides of the Polygon may 
likewife be known, in fubftracting the Angle of the Center of the Polygon from 180 Degrees; 
as taking 72 Degrees, the Angle of the Center of a Pentagon from 180 Degrees, there re- 
mains 108, the Angle of the Polygon. Moreover, taking from 180 Degrees, the Angle of 
the Center of an Octagon, which is 45 Degrees, there remains 135 Degrees, the Angle of the 
Octagon. 

Therefore to inferibe a Pentagon in a Circle, lay the Center of the Protractor upon the Fig. 47, 
Center of the Circle, and apply the Diameter of the Protractor, to the Diameter of the 
Circle ; then make a Dot againft the 72 d Degree of the Limb of the Protractor ; and thro' this 
Dot, and the Center of the Circle, draw a Line cutting the Circumference of the Circle in 
the Point C. Now take between your CompafTes the Dittance of the Points B and C, which 
will divide the Circumference of the Circle into 5 equal Parts, and drawing 5 right Lines, the 
Polygon will be made. 

If a Heptagon is to be inferibed, divide 360 Degrees by 7, and the Quotient 51 | d fhew- 
eth, that the Angle of the Center is almofl 51 ^ d •, therefore having placed the Protractor, as 
before, Note, 51 ' Degrees on the Limb of the Protractor, thro' which draw a Line from the 
Center of the Circle, and you will have the Side of the Heptagon. 

Note, Upon fome Protractors are placed the Numbers, denoting regular Polygons, to avoid 
the trouble of Divifion, in finding the Angles at the Center: as the Number 5, for a Penta- 
gon, is fet againft 72 Degrees on the Limb of the Protractor •, the Number 6 for a Hexagon, 
is fet over-againft 60 Degrees, the Number 7 againft 51 i. d , CsrV. 

USE IV. To defcribe any regular Polygon upon a given Line. 

Let the given Line be CD, upon which it is required to defcribe a regular Pentagon. 

We have fhewn in the precedent Ufe, how to find the Angles of any regular Polygon ; and pjg. ^g; 
fince the Angle made by the two Sides of the Polygon is 108 Degrees, 54 Degrees it's half 
will be the Semi- Angle of the Polygon ; by means of which, you may defcribe it in the fol- 
lowing manner : 

Apply the Diameter .of the Protractor to the Line C D, and it's Center to the End D \ 
then make a Dot againft the 54th Degree of the Limb, and draw the Line D F, making an 

E Angle 



j a Of the ConflruSiion and Ufes Book L 

Angle of 54 11 with the Line C D. Moreover, remove the Center of the Protractor to the 
other End C, and there likewife make an Angle of 54 Degrees, by drawing the Line C F ; 
then about the Point of Concourfe F, defcribe a Circle with the Diftance C F. Laftly, take 
the Length of the given Line C D, and carry it round the Circumference of the Circle, and 
drawing four right Lines, the Pentagon will be made. 

If an Octagon is to be defcribed upon a given right Line, take half the Angle of the 
Polygon, which is 6y 1 Degrees, and make an Angle of the like Number of Degrees upon 
each End of the given Line, by which an Ifofceles Triangle will be formed, whole Vertex 
will be the Center of a Circle, which will be divided into eight equal Parts, by carrying the 
CompafTes round it with the Extent of the given Line. 

There may be made many more Operations with the Inftruments already fpoken of; but 
we mail content ourfelves with thofe already mentioned, as being the mod common, and 
ufeful.

Plate 3. t ft AHI S Rule is ufually made of Box, 24 Inches long, an Inch and a half, or an Inch 
Pig f&lt; ' and a quarter broad, and of a Thicknefs at pleafure; one Side of it is divided in- 

JL to 24 equal Inches, according to the Standard at Guildhall, London, and every one of 
thefe 24 Inches are divided into 8 equal Parts •, that is, into halfs, quarters, and half-quar- 
ters : The half-inches are diftinguifhed from the quarters, and the quarters from the half- 
quarters, by Strokes of different Lengths, and at every whole Inch are fet Figures, pro- 
ceeding from 1 to 24. 

On the fame Side of this Rule, is commonly placed Giintcr 1 * Line of Numbers, of which 
more hereafter. 
Fig 2. The other Side of the Rule hath upon it the Lines of Timber and Board-Meafure, the 

Construction of which is as follows : 

The Line of Timber-Meafure begins at 8 and a half-, that is, when the Figures of the 
Timber-Line (land upright to you, it begins at the left End at 8 and a half, and proceeds to 
36, within an Inch, and ~ of an Inch of the other End. It is made from a Consideration, 
that 1728 Inches make a folid Foot: for any Divifioiv, fuppofe 9, which signifies the Side of 
a Square is fo placed againft fome one of the Divifions of Inches or Parts on the other Side, 
beginning from the right Hand, that it's Square, which is 81 Inches, multiplied by that 
Number of Inches and Parts, muft make 1728 Inches, or a folid Foot ; which in dividing 
1728 by 81, muft be placed againft 21 'Inches from the right Hand. In like manner the 
Divifion for the Number io, on the Line of Timber-Meafure, muft be placed againft \j T ~l- 
Inches on the other Side -, becaufe 1728, divided by the Square of 10, which is 100, gives 
1 7 riii and in like manner for all the other Divifions. But becaufe a Square, whole Side 
is either 1,2, &amp;c. to 8 Inches, requires more than 24 Inches in Length to multiply it by, 
in order to make a folid Foot, or 1728 Inches ; and fince 24 Inches is the whole Length of 
the Rule, therefore there is a Table put upon the left end of the Rule, fupplying a greater 
Length. 

The upper Row of Figures, numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, are Inches, or the Lengths 
of the Sides of Squares •, and the fecond and third Rows are the correfpondent Feet and In- 
ches to make up a folid Foot. It is made by dividing 144 Inches by the Squares of 1, 2, 3, 
4&gt; 5&gt; 6, 7, 8; as the Square of 1 Inch is 1, by which dividing 144, the Quotient will 
be 144 Feet for the firft Number of the fecond Row of Figures, and in like manner for the 
reft.

Chap. i. of the Carpenter's Joint-Rule ', &amp;C. I c- 

On, or next the other Edge of the Rule, you have the Line of Board-Meafure ; and when 
the Figures (land upright, you fee it numbered 7, 8, 9, &amp;V. to 36. which is juft 4 Inches 
from the right Hand, it is thus divided ; fuppofe the Divifion 7 is to be marked divide 
144, which is the Number of Inches in a fquare Foot, by 7, and the Quotient will be 20 ± In- 
ches ; whence the Divifion 7 muft be againft 20 £ Inches on the other Side of the Rule. ' A- 
gain, to mark the Divifion 8, divide 144 by 8, and the Quotient, which is 18 Inches,' mult 
be placed on the Line of Board-Meafure againft 18 Inches on the other Side: proceed thus 
for the other Divifions of the faid Line. But becaufe the Side of" a long Square, that is ei- 
ther 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 Inches, requires the other Side to be more than 24 Inches, which is the 
whole. Length of the Rule ; therefore there is a Table placed at the other end of the Rule, 
made in dividing 144 Inches by each of the Numbers in the upper Row, and then each of 
the Quotients by 12, to bring them into Feet. 

U S E 0/ the Carpenter's Joint- Rule i 
The Inches on this Rule are to meafure the Length or Breadth of any given Superficies of 
Solid, and the manner of doing it is fuperfluous to mention, it being not only eafy, but even 
natural to any Man ; for holding the Rule in the left Hand, and applying it to the Board, or 
any thing to be meafured, you have your Defire. But now for the Ufe of the other Side, I 
mall fhew in two or three Examples in each Meafure, that is, Superficial and Solid. 

Example I. The Breadth of any Superficies ; as Board, Glafs, or the like, being given : ttt 
find how much in Length makes a Square Foot. 

To do which, look for the Number of Inches your Superficies is broad, in the Line of 
Board Mt afore, and keep your Finger there-, and right againft it, on the Inches Side, you 
have the Ntin.btr of Inches that makes up a Foot of Board, Glafs, or any other Superficies 
Suppofe you have a Piece 8 Inches broad, how many Inches make a Foot ? Look for 8 on 
the Board Meafure, and juft againft your I inger (being fet to 8) on the Inch-Side, you will 
find 18, and 10 many Inches long, at that Breadth, goes to. make a fuperficial Foot. 

Again, fuppofe a Superficies is 18 Inches broad, then you will find that 8 Inches in 
Length will make a fuperficial Foot; and if a Superficies is 3 6 Inches broad, then 4 Inches 
in Ler.gch makes a Foot. 

Or you may do it more eafy thus : Take your Rule, holding it in your left Hand, and 
apply it to the Breadth of the Board or Glafs, making the End, which is next 36, even with 
one F dge of the Board or Glafs, and the other Edge of the Board will fhew how many Inches, 
or Quarters of an Inch, go to make a fquare Foot of Board or Glafs. This is but the Con- 
verfe of the former, and needs no Example ; for laying the Rule to it, and looking on the 
board-lvkuiure, you have your Defire. 

Or elfe you may do it thus, in all narrow Pieces under 6 Inches broad : As fuppofe 3 « 
Inches, double 3 ', it makes 6 \ - 3 then twice the Length from 6 \ to the End of the Rule*" 
will make a fuperficial Foot, or fo much in Length makes a Foot. 

Example II. A Superficies of any Length or Breadth being given, to find the Content. 
Flaving found the Breadth, and how much makes one Foot, turn that over as manv times 
as you can upon the Length of the Superficies, for fo many Feet are in that Superficies • But 
it it is a great Breadth, you may turn it over two or three times, and then take that toee- 

tfthe Superficies. 2 ' ^ *' ** ^ ***' " 3 ' *' 9 ' ^ * 5 ' l8 ' "' '" JI y ° U COme t0 the *» d 

The USE of the Table at the End of the Board-Meafure. 
If a Superficies is 1 Inch broad, how many Inches in Length muft there go to make a 
fuperficial Foot ? Look in the upper Row of Figures for 1 Inch, and under it, in the fecond 

^^.tpSi^ 1 whlch * ews that I2 Feet in Len ^ and ■ ^ - b3J 

Again a Superficies 5 Inches broad, will be found, in the faid Table, to have 2 Feet and 
about 5 Inches in Length to make a fuperficial Foot ; and a Prece 8 Inches broad," wi have 
a Length of 1 Foot 6 Inches to make a fuperficial Foot.

a Foot, for you will find three Inches on the other Side againft 24 : But if it is fmall Tim- 
oer, as under 9 Inches fquare, you muft feek the Square in the upper Rank in the Table, 

and 



1 6 Of the Conjlruclion and Ufes B o o k I . 

and right under you have the Feet and Inches that go to make a fold Foot, as was in the 
Table of Board Meafure : As fuppofe a Piece of Timber is 7 Inches fquare, look in the 
Table for 7, in the upper Row of Numbers, and you will find directly under 2 Feet, 1 1 In- 
ches, which is the Length of the Piece of Timber that goes to make a folid Foot: But if a 
Piece be not exactly fquare, viz. is broader at one Side than the other, then the ufual way 
is to add them both together, and take half the Sum for the Side of the Square ; but if they 
differ much, this way is very erroneous : for that half is always too great, which from hence 
will eafily be manifeft. 
?ig 3. Let A C be the longeft Side, C D the fhorteft, and B D, or A B, half their Sum, which 

is taken for the Side of the Square, that is, for the Side of a Square whofe Area is equal to 
the Product of the two Sides A C, and C D, into one another, or the Rectangle under them : 
Now with the Diftance B D, and on the Center B, defcribe a Semicircle •, draw the Dia- 
meter E B, at right Angles, to A D, and from the Point C raife the Perpendicular F C ; 
then it is manifeft, per Prop. 13. lib. 6. Eucl. that F C is a mean Proportional between the 
Sides AC, CD-, that is, FC is the true Side of the Square, which, per Prop. 15. lib. 3. 
Eucl. is much lefs than E B, or it's Equal A B, or B D. 

The ufual way likewife for round Timber, is to take a String, and girt it about, and the 
fourth part of it is commonly allowed for the Side of the Square, that is, for the Side of a 
Square equal to the circular Bafe, and then you deal with it as if it was juft Square. But this 
way is alfo erroneous •, for by this Method you lofe above ~ of the true Solidity. But for 
maintaining this ill Cuftom, they plead, The Overplus Meafure may well be allowed, becaufe 
the Chips cut off are of little Value, and will not near countervail the Labour of bringing the 
limber to a Square, to which Form it muft be brought before it be fit to ufe. 

The Defcription of Gunter'j Line, or the Line of Numbers. 

The Line of Numbers is only the Logarithms transferred on a Ruler from the Tables, 
by means of a Scale divided into a great Number of equal Parts-, and whereas in the Loga- 
rithms, by adding or fubftracting them from one another, the Quafita is produced ; fo here, 
by turning a Pair of CompafTes forwards or backwards, according to due Order on this 
Line, the ^u^efita will in like manner be produced. The Conftruction of this Line I fhall 
give in fpeaking of Gunter's Scale. 

As to the Length of the Line of Numbers, the longer it is, the better it is •, whence it 
hath been contrived feveral ways: As firft upon a Rule of two Foot, and a Rule of three 
Foot long, by Gunter, which (as I fuppofe) is the Reafon why it is called Gunter's Line ; 
then that Line was doubled, or laid fo together, that you might work either right on, or 
crofs from one to another, by Mr Windgate\ afterwards projected in a Circle, by Mr Ough- 
tred, and alfo to Aide one by another, by the the fame Author ; and laft of all, projected into 
a kind of Spiral, off, 10, or 20 Turns, more or lefs, by Mr Brown, the Ufes being in all 
of them in a manner the fame, only fome with CompafTes, as Mr Gunter's and y\xWind- 
gate's -, and fome with flat CompafTes, or an opening Index, as Mr Oughtred's and Mr Brown's ; 
and fome without either, as the Sliding-Rules. 

The Order of the Divifions on this Line of Numbers, and commonly on moft others, is 
thus -, it begins with 1, and fo proceeds with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 -, and then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6, 7, 8, 9, 10, whofe Order of Numeration is thus: The firft 1 fignifies one Tenth of any 
whole Number or Integer, and confequently the next 2 is two Tenths-, 3, three Tenths; 
and all the fmall intermediate Divifions are 100 Parts of an Integer, or a Tenth of one of* 
the former Tenths ; fo that 1 in the middle is one whole Integer -, the next 2, two Integers ; 
and 10 at the end, 10 Integers : Thus the Line is in it's moft proper Acceptation, or natural 
Divifion. 

But if you are to deal with a Number greater than 10, then 1 at the beginning muft fignify 
1 Integer, and 1 in the middle 10 Integers, and 10 at the end 100 Integers. But if you would 
have it to a Figure more, then the firft 1 is 10, the fecond 100, and the laft 10 a 1000. If 
you proceed further, then the firft 1 is 100, the middle 1 a 1000, and the 10 at the end 
10000, which is as great a Number as can well be difcovered, on this or moft ordinary Lines of 
Numbers ; and fo far, with convenient Care, you may refolve a Queftion tolerably exact. 

Numeration on the Line of Numbers. 

Any whole Number being given under four Figures, to find the Point on the Lint 
of Numbers that reprefents the fame. 
Firft look for the firft Figure of your Number amongft the long Divifions that are figured, 
and that leads you to the firft Figure of your Number -, then for the fecond Figure, count fo 
many Tenths from that long Divifion forwards, as that fecond Figure amounts to ; then for 
the third Figure, count from the laft Tenth fo many Centefmes as the third Figure contains; 
and fo for the fourth Figure, count, from the laft Centefme, fo many Millions as that fourth 
Figure has Units, or is in Value, and that will be the Point where the Number propounded 
is on the Line of Numbers. Two or three Examples will make this manifeft. 

Firft, to find the Point upon the Line of Numbers reprefenting the Number 12. Now 
becaufe the firft Figure of this Number is 1, you muft take the 1 in the middle for the firft 

Figure 5 






Chap. i. of the Carpenter's yoint-Rule^ &amp;c. 1 7 

Fio-ure ; then the next Figure being 2, count two Tenths from that 1, and there will be the 
Point reprefenting 12. 

S-condly, To rind the Point reprefenting 144, Fir It, as before, take for r the fir ft; Figure 
of the Number 144, the middle Figure 1 ; then for the fecond {viz. 4.) count four Tenths 
forwards •, laftly, for the other 4, count four Centefms further, and that is the Point for 144. 

Thirdly, To find the Point reprefenting 1728. Firft, as before, for 1000 take the middle 
I on the Line. Secondly, for 7 reckon feven Tenths forwards, and that is 700. Thirdly, 
for ?, reckon two Centefms, from that 7th Tenth, for 20. And, Laftly, for 8 you muft 
reafonably eftimate that following Ccntefm to be divided into 10 Parts (if it be not exprefTed, 
which in Lines of ordinary Length cannot be done), and 8 of that fuppofed 10 Parts is the 
precife Point for 1728, the Number propounded to be found; and the like of any other 

Number. 

But if you was to find a Fraction, ycu muft confider, that properly, or abfolutely, the 
Line only exprefTes Decimal Fractions ; as thus, T V&gt; or ~ T , or - rt ~, and more near the 
Rule in common Acceptation cannot exprefs-, as one Inch, one Tenth, one Hundredth, or one 
Thoufandth Part of an Inch, it being capable to be applied to any thing in a decimal way : 
(But if you would ufe other Fractions, as Quarters, Half-Quarters, &amp;rV. you muft reafonably 
read them, or elfe reduce them into Decimals.) 

The fundamental Ufes of the Line of Numbers. 

USE I. Two Numbers being given, to find a third Geometrically proportional to them, 
and to three a fourth, and to four a fifth, &amp;c. 

Extend your CompafTes upon the Line of Numbers, from one Number to another ; which 
done, if that Extent is applied (upwards or downwards, as you would either increafe or di- 
minifh the Number), from either of the Numbers, the moveable Point will fall upon the 
third proportional Number required. Alio the fame Extent, applied the fame way from 
the third, will give you a fourth, and from the fourth a fifth, &amp;c. For Example, let the 
Numbers 2 and 4 be propofed, to find a third Proportional, &amp;c. to them : Extend the Com- 
pafTes upon the firft Part of the Line of Numbers, from 2 to 4; which done, if the fame 
Extent is applied upwards from 4, the moveable Point will fall upon 8, the third Proportio- 
nal required ; and then from 8 it will reach to 16, the fourth Proportional ; and from 16 to 
32 the fifth, &amp;c. Contrariwife, if you would diminifh, as from 4 to 2, the moveable Point 
will fall on 1, and from 1 to T 5 , or .5, and from .5 to .25, &amp;c. as is manifeft from the Na- 
ture of the Logarithms, and Prop. 20. lib. 7. Eucl. 

But generally in this, and moft other Work, make ufe of the fmall Divifions in the middle 
of the Line, that you may the better eftimate the Fractions of the Numbers you make ufe of; 
for how much you mils in fetting the CompafTes to the firft and fecond Term, fo much the 
more you will err in the fourth ; therefore the middle Part will be moft ufeful : As for Ex- 
ample, as 8 to 11, fo is 12 to 16.50, if you imagine one Integer to be divided but into 10 
Parts, as they are on the Line on a two-foot Rule. 

USE II. One Number being given to be multiplied by another given Number, to find the 

Produtl. 

Extend your CompafTes from 1 to the MultiplicUor, and the fame Extent, applied the 
fame way from the Multiplicand, will caufe the moveable Point to fall upon the Product ; as 
is manifeft from the Nature of the Logarithms, and Defin. 15. lib. 7. Eucl. 

Example. Let 6 be given to be multiplied by 5 ; extend your CompafTes from 1 to 5, and 
the fame Extent will reach from 6 to 30, the Product fought. Again, fuppofe 125 is to be 
multiplied by 144-, extend you CompafTes from 1 to 125, and the moveable Point will fall 
from 144 on 18000 the Product. 

USE III. One Number being given to be divided by another, to find the Quotient. 

Extend your Compaflls from the Divifor to 1, and the fame Extent will reach from the 
Dividend to the Quotient ; or, extend the CompafTes from the Divifor to the Dividend, the 
fame Extent will reach the fame way from 1 to the Quotient, as is manifeft from the Nature 
of the Logarithms, and this Property, that as the Divifor is to Unity, fo is the Dividend to 
the Quotient. 

Example. Let 750 be a Number given, to be divided by 25 (the Divifor), extend your 
CompafTes downwards from 25 to 1 ; then applying that Extent the fame way from 750, and 
the other Point of the CompafTes will fall upon 30, the Quotient fought. Again, let 1728 
be given to be divided by 12 ; extend your CompafTes from 12 to 1, and the fame Extent 
will reach the fame way from 1728 to 144. 

If the Number is a Decimal Fraction, then you muft work as if it was an abfolute whole 
Number ; but if it is a whole Number joined to a decimal Fraction, it is worked here as 
properly as a whole Number : As fuppofe 1 11. 4 is to be divided by 1.728, extend your Com- 
pafTes from 1.728 to 1, the fame Extent, applied from 11 1.4, will reach to 64.5. So again, 
56.4 being to be divided by 8.75, and the Quotient will be found to be 6.45. 

Now to know of how many Figures any Quotient ought to confift, it is necefTary to write 
down the Dividend, and the Divifor under it, and fee how often it may be written under 

F iti 



j § Of the Conjl ruction and Ufes Bo o k I. 

it ; for fo many Figures muft there be in the Quotient : As in dividing this Number 12231 
by 27, according to the Rules of Divifion, 27 may be written 3 times under the Dividend •, 
therefore there muft be 3 Figures in the Quotient: for if you extend the Compaffes from 27 
to 1, it will reach from 122 31 to 453, the Quotient fought. 

Note, That in this Ufe, or any other, it is beft to order it fo, that your Compaffes may 
be at the clofeft Extent ; for you may take a clofe Extent more eafy and exact than a large 
Extent, as by Experience you will find. 

USE IV. Three Numbers being given, to find a fourth in a diretl Proportion. 

Extend your Compaffes from the firft Number to the fecond; that done, the fame Extent 
applied the fame v/ay from the third, will reach to the fourth Proportional fought, as is 
manifeft from the Nature of the Logarithms, and Prop. 19. lib. 7. Eucl. from whence it may 
be gathered, that the third Number multiply'd by the fecond, divided by the firft, will give 
the fourth fought. 

Example. If 7 give e 22, what will 14 give ? Extend your Compaffes upwards from 7 to 
14, and that Extent applied the fame way, will reach from 22 to 44, the fourth Proportional 
required. Again, if 38 gives 76, what will 96 give ? Extend your Compaffes from 38 to 
96, and the fame Extent will reach from 76 to 192, the fourth Proportional fought. 

U S E V*. Three Numbers being given, to find a fourth in an Inverfe Proportion. 
Extend your Compaffes from the firft of the given Numbers to the fecond of the fame 
Denomination ; if that Diftance be applied from the third Number backwards, it will reach 
to the fourth Number fought. 

Example. If 60 give e 5, what will 30 give? Extend your Compaffes from 60 to 30, and 
that Extent applied the contrary way from 5, will give 2.5 the Anfwer. Again, If 60 gives 
48, what will 40 give ? Extend your Compaffes from 60 to 40 -, that Extent applied the 
• contrary way from 48, will reach to 32, the fourth Number fought. 

USE VI. Three Numbers being given, to find a fourth in a duplicate Proportion. 

This Ufe concerns Queftions of Proportions between Lines and between Superficies ; now if 
the Denominations of the firft and fecond Terms are Lines, then extend your Compaffes from 
the firft Term to the fecond (of the fame kind of Denomination): this done, that Extent ap- 
plied twice the fame way from the third Term, and the moveable Point will fall upon the 
fourth Term required, which is manifeft from the nature of the Logarithms, and from hence, 
viz. Becaufe the fourth Number to be found is only a fourth Proportional to the Square of 
the firft, the Square of the fecond, and the third, it is plain that the third, multiplied by the 
Square of the fecond, divided by the third, will be the fourth Number fought. 

Example. If the Area of a Circle, whole Diameter is 14, be 154, what will the Content 
of a Circle be, whofe Diameter is 28 ? Here 14 and 28 having the fame Denomination, viz. 
both Lines, extend the Compaffes from 14 to 28, then applying that Extent the fame way 
From 154 twice, the moveable Point will fall upon 616, the fourth Proportional or Area 
fought : Becaufe Circles are to each other as the Squares of their Diameters, per Prop. 2. 
lib. 12. Eucl. 

USE VII. Three Numbers being given, to find a fourth in a triplicate Proportion. 

This Ufe is to find the Proportion between the Powers of Lines and Solids ; that is, two 
Lines being given and a Solid, to find a fourth Solid, that has the fame Proportion to the 
given Solid, as the given Lines have to one another. Therefore extend the Compaffts from 
the firft Line to the fecond, and that Extent, applied three times from the given Solid or 
third Number, will give the fourth fought : Becaufe the third multiplied by the Cube of the 
fecond, divided by the Cube of the firft, will give the fourth. 

Example. If an Iron Bullet, whofe Diameter is 4 Inches, weighs 9 Pounds, what will an- 
other Iron Bullet weigh, whofe Diameter is 8 Inches ? Extend your Compaffes from 4 to 8, 
that Extent applied the fame way three times from 9, will give 72, the Weight of the Bullet 
fought. Becaufe the Weight of homogeneal Bodies are as their Magnitudes, and Spheres are 
to one another as the Cubes of their Diameters, per Prop. 16. lib. 12. Eucl. 

USE VIII. To find a mean Proportional between two given Numbers. 

Bifect the Diftance between the given Numbers, which Point of BifccYion will fall on the 
mean Proportional fought : Becaufe the fquare Root of the Quotient of the two Extremes di- 
vided by one another, mutiplied by the leffer, is equal to the Mean. 

Example. The Extremes being 8 and 32, the middle Point between them will be found 
to be 16. 

USE IX. To find two mean Proportionals between two given Lines. 
Trifecc the Space between the two given Extremes, and the two Points of Infection will 
give the two Means. Becaufe the Cube Root of the Quotient of the Extremes divided by 
one another, multiplied by the leffer Extreme, will give the firft of the Mean Proportionals 
fought, and that firft Mean multiplied by the aforefaid Cube P.oot, will give the fecond. 

Example* 






Chap. 2. of the Four-Foot Gauging-Rod. Ia 

Example. Let 8 and 27 be the two given Extremes, the two Means will be found to be 12 

and 1 8, which are the two Means fought. 

U S E X. To find the Square Root of any Number under 1 000000. 
The Square Root of any Number is always a mean Proportional between 1, and theNum 
ber whole Root you would find ; but yet with this general Caution, viz. If the Fiaures of 
the Number are even, that is, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, fcfV. then you muft look for the Unit at the 
Beginning of the Line, and the Number in the fecond Part or Radius, and the Root in the 
fiat Part ; or gather reckon 10 at the end to be Unity, and then both Root and Square will 
fail backwards towards the middle in the fecond Length or Part of the Line • But if thev be 
odd, then the middle 1 will be mofl convenient to be counted Unity, and both Root and 
Square will be found from thence forwards towards 10 ; fo that according to this Rule the 
Square Root of 9 will be found to be 3, the Square Root of 64 will be found to be 8 the 
Square Root of 144 to be 12, &amp;c. ' 

USE XI. To find the Cube Root of any Number under 1000000000. 
_ The Cube Root is always the firft of two mean Proportionals between 1 and the Number 
given, and therefore to be found by trifedting the Space between them; whence the Cube 

a f, 'C u f K U p ^ the u R0 T ° C ° f I728 ° is near 26 &gt; the Ro ° c of 17^00 is aK 
moll 5 6. Although the Point on the Line reprefenting all the fquare Numbers is in one 

place, yet by altering the Unit, it produce* various Points and Numbers for their eftXe 

proper Roots The Rule to find this, is in this manner: You muft fet Dots (or fuppofe 

them to be fet) over the firft Figure to the Left-hand, the fourth Figure, the feventh, and 

the tenth ; now if by this means the laft Dot to the Left-hand falls oS the laft Figure, as it 

doth in 1728, then the Unit muft be placed at 1 in the middle of the Line, ancTthe Root 

the Square, and Cube, will all fall forwards towards the end of the Line 

But if it falls on the laft but t as it doth in 17280, then the Unit* may be placed at 1 

in the Beginning of the Line, and the Cube in the fecond Length; or elfe the Unit may be 

flj undTr Sft F £he ^ and th£ Qlbe " th£ firft Pa " &lt;* the Line ' But ifTlaft

Of the Confiruciion and Ufes Book I, 

Conftruclion of the izvo Diagonal Lines. 
Thefe two Diagonal Lines are put upon this Gauging-Rod, in the fame manner that our 
Author, in the laft life of the Line ot Solids in the fecond Book directs, for putting on 
the Diagonals on his Gauging-Rod, viz. by taking the Diagonal of fome VeiTel that is fimi- 
lar, or nio-hly fimilar to the Veffels, whole Contents in Beer, or Wine Gallons, are after- 
wards, by means of them, to be found ; and then knowing how many Gallons in Beer and 
Wine the aforefaid VeiTel contains, which Gallons muft be let againft the Inches, or Parts of 
Inches of their Diagonals Length, on the Diagonal-Face of the Gauging-Rod. Now to 
find how many Inches, or Parts, the Diagonal of any other fimilar Velfel muft be, when it's 
Content in Beer and Wine-Gallons is given ; you muft fay, As the Content of the firft Vef- 
fel, which is known, is to the Cube of the Length of it's Diagonal ; So is the Content of that 
other fimilar Veflel, in Beer or Wine-Gallons, to the Cube of the Length of it's Diagonal : 
the Cube-Root of which extracted, will give the Length of the Diagonal fought. As for 
Example, fuppofe a little VeiTel fimilar, or nighly fimilar to Englijh Veffels of a ufual Form, 
contains i Beer Gallon, or about i ~ Wine Gallon, and the Diagonal is found to be 7.75 
Inches-, what will be the Diagonal of a fimilar VeiTel, containing 2 Beer Gallons, or 2.8 
Wine Gallons ? Say, As 1 Gallon is to the Cube of 7.7 5, which is 465.48437, So is 2 Gal- 
lons to the Cube of the Diagonal fought, 930.96875, whofe Root will be 9.72 Inches, and 
fo much will be the Length of the Diagonal : therefore fet 2 Beer Gallons on the Diagonal 
Face of the Rod, againft 9.72 Inches. In this manner may the Diagonal Face of the Rod be 
divided from 1 Beer Gallon to 240, and from 1 Wine Gallon to 300, and fubdivided in half 
Gallons, as on the Rod. 

Confiruciion of the Gauge-Line on the fecond Face of the Rod. 
On this Line is fet the Gallons, and hundred Parts of Gallons, that any Cylinder, an 
Inch deep, and any Inches and Parts, from 1 to 46 in Diameter, contains of Ale. As for Ex- 
ample i againft 1.9 Indus ftands .01 of a Gallon, denoted by a Dot ; againft 2.63 Inches 
frauds .02 of a Gallon. The Tenths of the Gallons are denoted by the Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, 
13c. as .1 of a Gallon is fet againft ^.^6 Inches ; .2 againft 8.44 Inches, and 1 Gallon againft 
18.95 Inches, as per Figure. The Conftruction of this Line is thus : Becaufe 282 folid In- 
ches make an Ale Gallon, therefore the Diameter of a Cylinder, one Inch deep, whofe Con- 
tent is an Ale Gallon, or 282 folid Inches, will be 18.95 Inches •, whence againft 18.95 In- 
ches, on the fame Face of the Gauging-Rod, fet, on the Line drawn to contain the Divifions 
of the Gauge-Line, 1 Gallon. Now to find the Diameter of a Cylinder one Inch deep, that 
fhall contain the .01 Part of a Gallon, fay, As 1 Gallon is to the .01 Part of a Gallon, So is 
the the Square of 18.95 Inches, which is 359, to the Square of the Diameter of the Cylin- 
der, containing the hundredth Part of a Gallon, which will be found by extracting the 
fquare Root of that Quantity 1.9 Inch : therefore fet the Hi ft Dot againft 1.9 of an Inch. 
Again, to find againft what Inches, or Parts, .02 of a Gallon muft be placed, fay, As 1 is to 
.02, So is 359 to the Square of the Number of Inches, or Parts, whofe Root extracted will 
give 2.63 Inches ; againft which make a fecond Dot for .02 of a Gallon. In this manner pro- 
ceed for all the other Divifions on the Gauge-Line, always making 1 and 359 the two firft 
Terms of the Proportion, and the Gallons or Parts the third ; fo fhall the fourth be the 
Square of the Inches, or Parts, that the Gallons, or Parts exprefled in the third Term, are 
to be fet againft. The Reafon of the aforefaid Porportion is, that Cylinders, of equal Alti- 
tudes, are to each other as their Bafes, and Circles as the Squares of their Diameters. 

Confiruciion of the Scales on the third and fourth Faces. 

The firft Scale of Lines on the third Face, which ferves for finding the Gallons wanting 
in a Hogfliead pofited with it's Axis parallel to the Florizon, or lying down, contains the 
Divifions from 1 Gallon to 54 Gallons, which is the Number of Ale-Gallons a Hogfliead 
contains when full. 

The fecond Scale of Lines, on the fame Face, containing the Divifions from 1 Gallon to 
108 Gallons, which are the Number of Ale-Gallons contained in a Butt, is for the fame Ufe 
as the firft Scale of Lines when the Butt is lying. 

The third Scale, likewife numbered from 1 Gallon to 108, is for finding how many Gal- 
lons is wanting in a Butt ftanding upright. 

The three Scales of Lines, on part of the fourth Face, are, as I have already faid, for 
finding the Wants in a Firkin, Kilderkin, and Barrel lying down, in Ale-Gallons. The rea- 
dieft way to make the Divifions of either of thefe Scales of Lines for their correfpondent Vef- 
fels, when lying down, as for a Hogfhead, is to pour in firft one Gallon of Water, and then 
put the Rod downright into the Bung-hole to the oppofite Staves •, then where the Surface 
of the Water cuts the third Face of the Rod (becaufe the Scale of Lines for the Hogfliead 
is on that Face) make the Divifion for 1 Gallon •, then pour in another Gallon, and where 
the Surface of the Water cuts the Rod, make the Divifion for 2 Gallons. Again, pour in 
another Gallon, and where the Surface of the Water cuts the Rod, make the Divifion for 
three Gallons. Proceed thus, by pouring in of one Gallon fucceflively after another, and mak- 



ing

ing of Divifions at every Place in the Face of the Rod, to which the Water arifes, until the 
Hothead be full, and then the Scale for a Hogfhead, on the third Face, will be divided, 
proceed, in the fame manner, in making the Divifions for the other Scales of Lines ufed in 
rinding the Wants in the feveral Veffels aforementioned lying down. And taking off the 
Head'of a Butt that is (landing, and pouring of Water in the fame manner as in the Hogf- 
head, putting the Rod downright into the Butt, and making Divifions on the Rod, as was 
done for the Hogfhead, the Line will be finifhed, when figured. 

Note, The Divifions for Half-Gallons, marked by long Dots on the fourth Face, are made 
by pouring in of Flalf-Gallons fucceffively, &amp;c. 

USE of the Diagonal Lines on the Gauging- Rod. 
To find the Content of a Veffel in Beer or Wine- Gallons. 

Put the brafed End of the Gauging-Rod into the Bung-hole of the Cafk, with the Diago- 
nal Lines upwards, and thruft the brafed End to the meer.»g of the Head and Staves. 

Then with Chalk make a Mark on the middle of the Bung- hole of the Veffel, and alfo on 
the Diagonal Lines of the Rod, right againft, or over one another, when the brafed End is 
thruft home to the Head and Staves. 

Then turn the Gauging-Rod to the other End of the VefTel, and thruft the brafed End home 
to the End as before. 

And fee if the Mark made on the Gauging-Rod come even with the Mark made on the 
Bung- Hole, when the Rod was thruft to the other End ; which if it be, the Mark made on 
the Diagonal Lines, will, on the fame Lines, fhew the whole Content of the Cafk in Beer or 
Wine-Ga'lons. 

But if the Mark firft made on the Bung-hole be not right againft that made on the Rod, 
when put the other way ; then right againft the Mark made on the Bung-hole, make another 
on the Diagonal Lines: then the Divifion on the Diagonal Line^ between the two Chalks, 
will fhew the Veffel's whole Content in Beer or Wine-Gallons. As for Example ; if the Dia- 
gonal Line of a Veffel be 28 Inches 4 Tenths, it's Content in Beer-Gallons will be near 51, 
and in Wine-Gallons 62. 

But if a VeiTel be open, as a Half-Barrel, Tun, or Copper, and the Meafure from the 
middle on one Side, to the Head and Staves, be 38 Inches, the Diagonal Line gives 122 
Beer-Gallons-, half of which, viz. 6i f is the Content of the open Half-Tub. 

But if you have a large Veffel, as a Tun, or Copper, and the Diagonal Line, taken by a 
long Rule, prove 70 Inches ; then the Content of that VeiTel may be found thus : 

Every Inch, at the Beginning-End of the Diagonal Line, call 10 Inches, then 10 Inches be- 
comes 100 Inches. 

And every Tenth of a Gallon call 100 Gallons; and every whole Gallon, with a Figure, 
call 1000 Gallons. Example, at 44.8 Inches, on the Diagonal Beer-Line, is 200 Gallons j 
fo alfo at 4 Inches 48 Parts, now called 44 Inches 8 Tenths, is juft two Tenths of a Gallon, 
now called 200 Gallons. 

Alfo if the Diagonal Line be 76 Inches and 7 Tenths, a clofe Cafk, of fo great a Diago- 
nal, will hold 1000 Beer-Gallons: but an open Cafk but half fo much, viz. 500 Beer- 
Gallons. 

For reducing of Wine-Gallons to Beer-Gallons, or, vice verfa, by Infpection, this may b« 
done. 

Thus 30 Wine- Gallons, is 24 4. Beer-Gallons, &amp;c. 

USE of the Gauge- Line. 
USE I. To find the Content of any Cylindrical Veffel in Ale-Gallons. 
Seek the Diameter of the VeiTel in the Inches, and juft againft it, on the Gauge-Line, is 
the Quantity of Ale-Gallons contained in one Inch deep : then this multiplied by the Length 
of the Cylinder, will give it's Content in Ale-Gallons. For Example ; fuppofe the Length 
of the Veffel be 32.06, and the Diameter of it's Bafe 25 Inches, what is the Content in Ale- 
Gallons ? Right againft 25 Inches, on the Gauge- Line, is 1 Gallon, and .745 of a Gallon ; 
which multiplied by 32.06, the Length, gives 55.9447 Gallons for the Content of the Veffel. 

USE II. The Bung-Diameter of a Hogfhead is 25 Inches, the Head-Diameter 22 Inches, and 
the Length 32.06 Inches ; to find the Quantity of Ale-Gallons contained in it. 

Seek 25, the Bung-Diameter, on the Line of Inches, and right againft it, on the Gauge- 
Line, you will find 1.745 '&gt; take 4. of it, which is .580, and fet it down twice. Seek 22 In- 
ches, the Head Diameter, and againft it you will find, on the Gauge-Line, 1.356; 4 of which 
added to twice .580, gives 1.6096; which multiplied by the Length 32.06, the Prod uct will 
be 51.603776, the Content in Ale-Gallons. This Operation fuppofes, that the aforefaid 
Hogfhead is in the Figure of the middle Fruftum of a Spheroid. 

The Ufe of the Lines on the two other Faces of the Rod, is very eafy; for you need but 
put it downright into the Bung-hole (if the VeiTel you defire to know the Quantity of Ale- 
Gallons contained therein be lying), to the oppofite Staves ; and then where the Surface of the 
Liquor cuts any one of the Lines appropriated for that VeiTel, will be the Number of Gallons 
contained in that Veffel.

Of the ConftruElion and Ufe of EverardV Sliding- Rule for Gauging. 

THIS Inflrument is commonly made of Box, exactly a Foot long, one Inch broad, and 
about fix Tenths of an Inch thick. It confifts of three Parts, viz. A Rule, and two 
fmall Scales or Sliding- Pieces to Aide in it •, one on one Side, and the other on the other : So 
that when both the Sliding- Pieces are drawn out to their full Extent, the whole will be three 
Foot long, 
fig. s. On the firft broad Face of this Inflrument are four Lines of Numbers •, the firft Line of 

Numbers confifts of two Radius's, and is numbered i, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1. and then 2, 
3, 4, 5, &amp;c. to 10. On this Line are placed four Brafs Center Pins, the firft in the firft Ra- 
dius, at 2150.42, and the third likewife at the fame Number taken in the feeond Radius, 
having MB fet to them-, fignifying, that the aforefaid Number reprefents the Cubic Inches 
in a Malt Bufhel : the feeond and fourth Center Pins are fet at the Numbers 282 on each Ra- 
dius ; they have the Letter A fet to them, fignifying that the aforefaid Number 282 is the Cu- 
bic Inches in an Ale-Gallon. Note, The little long black Dots, over the Center Pins, are put 
directly over the proper Numbers. This Line of Numbers hath A placed at the End thereof, 
and is called A for Diftinction-fake. 

The feeond and third Lines of Numbers which are on the Sliding-Piece (and which may 
be called but one Line), are exactly the fame with the firft Line of Numbers: They are both, 
for Diftinction, called B. The little black Dot, that is hard by the Divifion 7, on the firft 
Radius, having Si fet after it, is put directly over .707, which is the Side of a Square in- 
fcribed in a Circle, whofe Diameter is Unity. The black Dot hard by 9, after which is 
writ S e&gt; is fet diredly over .886, which is the Side of a Square equal to the Area of a Cir- 
cle, whofe Diameter is Unity. The black Dot that is nigh W, is fet directly over 231, 
which is the Number of Cubic Inches in a Wine-Gallon. Laftly, the black Dot by C, is fet 
directly over 3.14, which is the Circumference of a Circle, whofe Diameter is Unity. 

The fourth Line, on the firft Face, is a broken Line of Numbers of two Radius's, num- 
bered 2, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, the Number 1 is fet againft M B on 
the firft Radius. This Line of Numbers hath MD let to it, fignifying Malt Depth. 
Fig. 9. On the feeond broad Face of this Rule, are, 

I. A Line of Numbers of but one Radius, which is numbered 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. to 10, and 
hath D fet at the End thereof for diftinguifhing it. There are upon it four Brafs Center 
Pins : the firft, to which is fet W G, is the Gauge-Point for a Wine-Gallon •, that is, the 
Diameter of a Cylinder, whofe Height is an Inch, and Content 231 Cubic Inches, or a Wine- 
Gallon, which is 17.15 Inches. The feeond Center-Pin AG ftands at the Gauge-Point for 
an Ale-Gallon, which is 18.95 Inches. The third Center-Pin M S ftands at 46.3, which is 
the Side of a Square, whofe Content is equal to the Inches in a folid Bufhel. The fourth 
Center-Pin M R is the Gauge-Point for a Malt Bufhel, which is 52.32 Inches. 

II. Two Lines of Numbers on the Sliding-Piece, which are exactly the fame as on the 
Sliding-Piece on the other Side the Rule, they are called C. The firft black Dot fomething 
on this Side the Divifion of the Number 8, to which is fet G c, is fet to .795, which is the 
Area of a Circle whofe Circumference is Unity ; and the feeond, to which is fet G d, ftands 
at .785, the Area of a Circle, whofe Diameter is Unity. 

III. Two Lines of Segments, each numbered 1, 2, 3 to iOo-, the firft is for finding the 
Ullage of a Cafk, taken as the middle Fruftum of a Spheroid, lying with it's Axis parallel 
to the Horizon, and the other for finding the Ullage of a Cafk ftanding. 

Fig, 10. Again, on one of the narrow Faces of this Rule, is, (1.) A Line of Inches, numbered r, 

2 &gt; 3&gt; 4» &amp;c- to 12. each of which is fubdivided into ten equal Parts. (2.) A Line, by 
means of which, and the Line of Inches, is found a mean Diameter for a Cafk in the Figure 
of the middle Fruftum of a Spheroid ; it is figured 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. to 7. at the End thereof is 
writ Spheroid. (3.) A Line for finding the mean Diameter of a Cafk in the Figure of the mid- 
dle Fruftum of a parabolic Spindle, which by Gaugers is called the feeond Variety of Cajks ; 
it is numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and at it's End is writ, 2 Variety. (4.) A Line, by means 
of which may be found the mean Diameter of a Cafk of the third Variety ; that is, a Cafk in 
the Figure of two parabolic Conoids abutting upon a common Bafe : it is numbered 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, at the End thereof is writ 3 Variety. 

Fig. 11. And on the other narrow Face, is, (1.) A Foot divided into 100 equal Parts, every ten of 

which are numbered ; F M ftands at the beginning of it, fignifying Foot-Meafure. (2.) A 
Line of Inches, like that before fpoken of, having I M fet to the Beginning thereof, fignifying 
Inch-Meafure. (3.) A Line for finding the mean Diameter for the fourth Variety of Calks, 
which is the middle Fruftum of two Cones, abutting upon one common Bafe ; it is numbered 
l i 2 &gt; 3&gt; 4&gt; 5&gt; 6. and at the Beginning thereof is writ F C, fignifying Fruftum of a Cone. 

Thefe 






Chap. 3. ofEverard's Sliding-Rule. 23 

Thefe are all the Lines on the four Faces of the Rule •, but on the Backfide of the two 
S!idin&lt;*-Pieces are a Line of Inches from 13 to 36, when the two Sliding- Pieces are put End- 
ways together, and againft that the correfpondent Gallons, or hundred Parts, that any fmall 
Tub, or fuch like open Veflfel (from 13 to 36 Inches Diameter) will contain at one Inch deep i 
it's Conftruction is the fame as before delivered, in fpeaking of the Line of Ale Area on the 
Four-foot Gauging-Rod. 

All the Lines of Numbers, before-defcribed, may be put upon the Faces of this Sliding- 
Ruie, as directed in the Conftruction of the Line of Numbers on Gunter's Scale ; only you 
muft obferve, that the firft Radius of the broken Line of Numbers MD, begins directly un- 
der MB, and ends directly under the other MB; and that when either of the Lines of 
Numbers A or B are made, the Line M D from them may alfo be made. Example-* The Di- 
ftance from 1 to 2, on the Line A, laid off from 1 (towards the Left Hand) to 2, on the 
Line iVi D, will give the Divifion 2; the Diftance from 1 to 3, on the Line A, will be equal 
to the Diftance from 1 to 3 •, the contrary way on the Line MD: underftand the fame of other 
Divifions and Subdivifions. The reafon of thus breaking this Line of Numbers, I fhall fhew 
in it's Ufe. 

The Line of Segments for the middle Fruflum of a Spheroid lying, may be put upon the 
Sliding- Rule in the following manner : Take fome Veffel lying, as a Butt, and fill it full of 
Water, then find it's Content in Ale or Wine-Gallons (for it matters not which), take alfo 
it's Bung-Diameter very exactly in Inches, or Tenths of Inches. Now to find againft what 
Number, on the Line of Numbers of the Sliding-Piece, any Divifion of the Line of Segments 
mud (land •, fuppofe the Divifion 1, fay, As Unity is to .01, So is the Content of the afore* 
faid Veffel in Gallons to a fourth Number (which will be the Gallons, or Gallons and Parts 
that are contained in fuch a Segment of the VefTel, as .01 is of a fimilar VefTel, whofe Area 
is fuppofed Unity •,) then let out of the VefTel as many Gallons of .Water as that fourth Pro- 
portional directs, and having taken the Dry Inches, fay, By the Rule of Three, As the Bung- 
Diameter ; s to thofe Dry Inches found, So is 100 to a fourth Number ; which will be the 
Number on the Line C, againft which the Divifion 1 on the Segment-Line muft ftand. 

Again, to find where the Divifion 2 muft ftand on the Line of Segments, fay, As 1 is to 
.02, So is the Content of the aforefaid VefTel to the Gallons that muft be taken out of it ; then 
fay, As the Bung-Diameter is to the Dry Inches, So is 100 to the Number on the Line C, 
againft which the Divifion 2 mult ftand. Proceed in this manner for finding the Divifions 3$ 
4, 5&gt; 6, 7, 8, 9, and when you come to find where the Divifion 10 muft ftand, you muft fay, 
As Unity is to the VefTel's Content, So is .1 to the Number of Gallons to be taken out of the 
VefTel, and go on as before. Moreover, to find where the Divifion 20 muft ftand, fay, As 
1 is to the Content, So is .2 to the Number of Gallons to be taken out of the VefTel, £JV« 
In this manner may the Divifions to 100 be found. 

To find where the firft Subdivifion before 1 muft ftand, fay, As 1 is to the VefTel's Con- 
tent, So is .002 to the Number of Gallons to be let out of the VefTel, and proceed as at firft 
directed. And for the fecond Subdivifion, make .003 the third Term of the Rule of Three, 
and proceed as before. 

For the Subdivifions between 1 and 2, 2 and 3, &amp;c. fuppofe 1 to be .0100, then the firft 
Divifion from 1 will be .011, the fecond .012, the third .013, &amp;c. which muft be made the 
third Terms of the firft Rule of Three, for finding where any of thofe Subdivifions muft 
ftand. And for the Subdivifions between 10 and 20, 20 and 30, you muft fuppofe 10 to be 
.10, and 20 to be .20; then the firft Subdivifion from 10 will be .11, the fecond .12, the 
third .13, &amp;?*. which will be the third Terms in the firft Rule of Three, for finding where- 
abouts thefe Divifions muft ftand. 

The other Segment- Line, on the fame Face of the Rule, may be made in the fame mannef 
as this, by fetting the aforefaid VefTel upright, and making ufe of the Length inftead of the 
Bung-Diameter. 

The Conftruction of the four Lines on the narrow Faces of this Rule, is from the Rules 
that Everard hath laid down for finding the Contents of the four Varieties of Cafks. For, 
(1.) If there is a Cafk in the Form of the middle Fruftum of a Spheroid, half the Difference 
of the Squares of the Bung and Head-Diameter, added to the Sum and half Sum of the faid 
Squares, divided by 3, will be the Square of the mean Diameter for a fpheroidal VefTel ; the 
Root of which will be the mean Diameter. (2.) Three Tenths of the Differences of the 
Squares of the Bung and Head-Diameters, added to the Sum and half Sum of the faid Squares, 
and the whole divided by 3, will be the Square of the mean Diameter of a Cafk of the fecond 
Vanety. (3.) To the Sum and half Sum of the Squares of the Bung and Head-Diameters, 
add one Tenth of the Difference of the faid Squares, which Sum, divided by 3, gives the 
Square of the mean Diameter of a Cafk of the third Variety. (4.) And Laftly, from the 
Sum and half Sum of the Squares of the Bung and Head-Diameters, fubftract half the Square 
of the Difference of Diameters, and the Remainder, divided by 3, will be the Square of the 
mean Diameter for the fourth Variety of Cafks, 

USE 



24 Of the ConjlruBion and Ufes Book L 

USE o/ Everard'j S&gt;li ding-Rule. 
USE I. One Number being given to be multiplied by another ; to find the Producl. 

Notation on the Lines of Numbers upon this Rule, is the fame as before was fhewn in the 
Ufe of the Carpenter's Rule ; therefore I mall not here repeat it, but proceed to folve this 
Ufe by the following Examples : Suppofe 4 is to be multiplied by 6: Set 1 upon the Line of 
Numbers B, to 4 upon the Line A, and then againft 6 upon B, is 24, the Product fought 
upon A. Again, to multiply 26 by 68, fet 1 upon B to 26 upon Aj then againft 68 upon 
B) is 1768 on A. 

Note, The Product of any two Numbers will have fo many Places as there are in both the 
Numbers given, except when the lefTer of them does not exceed fo many of the firft Figures 
of the Product, for then it will have one lefs. 

USE II. One Number being given to be divided by another, to find the Quotient. 

Suppofe 24 is to be divided by 4, what is the Quotient ? Set 4 upon B, to 1 upon A ; then 
againft 24 upon B, is 6 upon A, which will be the Quotient. 

Again, let 952 be divided by 14: To find the Quotient, fet 14 upon A, to 1 upon B, 
and againft 952 upon A, you will have 68 the Quotient upon B. 

Note, The Quotient will always confift of fo many Figures as the Dividend hath more than 
the Divifor, except when the Divifor does not exceed fo many of the firft Figures of the Di- 
vidend j for then it will have one Place more. 

USE III. Three Numbers being given, to find a fourth in a diretl Proportion. 

If 8 gives 20, what will 22 give ? Set 8 upon B, to 20 upon A j and then againft 22 on B, 
ftands 55 upon A, which is the fourth Number fought. 

USE IV. To find a mean Proportional between two given Numbers. 

Example. Let the two Numbers be 50 and 72 •, fet 50 upon C, to 72 upon D ; and then 
againft 72 upon C, is 60 upon D, which is the Geometrical Mean between 50 and 72. 

USE V. To find the fquare Root of any Number under 1 000000 
The Extraction of the fquare Root, by help of this Inftrument, is eafier than any of the 
aforefaid Ufes : for if the Lines C and D be applied one to another, fo that 10 at the End of 
D, be even with 10 at the End of C •, then thofe two Lines, thus applied, are like a Table 
of fquare Roots, (hewing the fquare Root of any Number by Inflection only : for againft 
any Number upon C, you have the fquare Root thereof upon D. 

Note, When the Number given confifts of 1, 3, 5, or 7 Places of Integers, feek it in the 
firft Radius on the Line C, and againft it you have the Root required upon D. Example, Let 
the Number given be 144, I find this on the firft Radius of the Line C, and againft it is 12, 
the Root fought upon the Line D. 

USE VI. The Diameter or Circumference of a Circle being given, to find either. 

Set 1 on the Line A againft 3. 141, (where is writ C) on the Line B, and againft any Dia- 
meter, on the Line A, you have the Circumference on the Line B, and contrariwife : As fup- 
pofe the Diameter of a Circle be 20 Inches, the Circumference will be 62.831 j and if the 
Circumference be 94.247, the Diameter will be 30. 

USE VII. The Diameter of any Circle being given \ to find the Area, in Inches, or in 

Ale or Wine- Gallons. 

Example. Let the Diameter be 20 Inches, what is the Area? Set 1 upon D to .785, 
(where is fet O d) and then againft 20 upon D, is 3 14. 159, the Area required. Now to find 
that Circle's Area in Ale-Gallons, fet 18.95 (marked AG) upon D to 1 upon C ; then 
againft the Diameter 20, upon D, is the Number of Ale-Gallons upon C, which is 1.11 Gal- 
lons. Underftand the fame for Wine-Gallons, by the proper Gauge-Point. 

USE VIII. The tranfverfe and conjugate Diameters of an Ellipfis being given, to find 

the Area in Ale-Gallons. 

Example. Let the tranfverfe Diameter be 72 Inches, and the Conjugate 50 : Set S59-°5i 
the Square of the Gauge-Point, upon B, to one of the Diameters (fuppofe 50 upon A) ; then 
againft the other Diameter 72 upon B, you will have the Area upon A, which, in this Ex- 
ample, will be 10.02 Ale-Gallons, the Content of this Ellipfis at one Inch deep. The like 
may be done for Wine-Gallons, if inftead of 359.05, you ufe 249.1 1, the Square of the Gauge- 
Point for Wine-Gallons. 

USE IX. To find the Area or Content of a Triangular Superficies in Ale Gallons. 

Let the Bafe of the Triangle be 260 Inches, and the Perpendicular, let fall from the oppo- 
fite Angle, be 1 10 Inches ; fet 282 (marked A) upon B, to 130, half the Bafe upon A ; then 
againft no upon B, is 50.7 Gallons upon A. 

USE 



Chap. 3. tf Everard'j Sliding-Rute 25 

USE X. To find the Content of an Oblong in Ale Gallons. 
Sappofe one of the Sides is 130 Inches, and the other 180 ; fet 282 upon B, to 180 upoli 
A-, 'then again ft 130 upon B, is 82.97 Ale Gallons, the Area required. 

USE XI. The Side of any regular Polygon king given, to find the Content thereof in 

Ale Gallons. 



in 



In any regular Polygon, the Perpendicular let fall from the Center to one of the Sides, be- 
Itl g found and multiplied by half the Sum of the Sides, gives the Area. Example, in a Pen- 
tagon, fuppofe the Side is an Inch, then the Perpendicular let fall from the Center, will be 
found'. 837, in faying, As the Sine of half the Angle at the Center, which in this Polygon is 
06 Deorecs, is to half the given Side .5 -, So is the Sine of 36 Degrees taken from 90, which 
is rA. l?i grees, to the Perpendicular aforefaid : whence the Area of a Pentagon Polygon, each 
of "whofe Sides is Unity, will be 1.72 Inches ; which, divided by 282, gives .0061 the Ale. 
Ga Ions in that Polygon. By the fame Method you may find the Area of any other Polygon, 
whole Side is Unity in Ale Gallons. Now, fuppofe the Side of a Pentagon is 50 Inches, What 
is the Content thereof in Ale Gallons ? Set 1 upon D, to .006! uponC; then againft 50 upon 
D, you have the Area 15.252 Ale Gallons upon C. 

USE XII. To find the Content of a Cylinder in Ale Gallons. 

Suppofe the Diameter of the Bafe of a Cylinder is 120 Inches, and the perpendicular 
Height 36 Inches. Set the Gauge- Point (A G) to the Height 36 upon C ; then againft 120 
the Diameter, upon D, is 1443.6 the Content in Ale Gallons. 

USE XIII. The Bung and Head Diameters, together with the Length of any Cafk, being 
given, to find it's Content in Ale or Wine Gallons. 

Suppofe the Length of a Cafk taken, as the middle Fruftum of a Spheroid be 40 Inches, 
it's Head-Diameter 24 Inches, and Bung-Diameter 32 Inches. Subftradt the Head-Diameter 
from the Bung-Diameter, and the Difference is 8 : then look for 8 Inches on the Line of In- 
ches, upon the firft narrow Face of the Rule ; and againft it on the Line Spheroid ftands 5.6 
Inches, which added to the Head-Diameter 24, gives 29.6 Inches for that Calk's mean Dia- 
meter : thin fet th&lt; Gauge-Point for Ale (marked AG) upon D, to 40 upon v_ ; and againft 
29.6 upon D, is 97 45 the Content of that Cafk in Ale-Gallons. If the Gauge Point for 
"Wine (marked W G) is ufed inftead of that for Ale, you will have the Veifel's Content in 
Wine-Gallons. 

If a Cafk, fuppofe of the fame Dimenfions as the former, be taken as the middle Fruftum of 
a paraboiick Spindle, which is of the fecond Variety, you mutt fee what Inches and Parts on 
the Line marked Second Variety, Hand againft the Difference of the Bung and Head-Diameters, 
which, in this Example, is 8 •, and you will find 5.1 Inches, which added to 24 the Hrad- 
Diameter, makes 29.1 Inches the mean Diameter of the Cafk ; then let the Rule as before, 
and againft 29.1 Inches, you will have 94.12 Ale-Gallons for the Content of the Cafk. 

Again •, if a Calk, fuppofe of the fame Dimenfions with either of the former ones, be taken 
as the middle Fruftum of 2 paraboiick Conoids, which is one of the third Variety, you will 
find againft 8 Inches (.the Difference of the Bung and Head-Diameters), on the Line of Inches, 
Hands 4.57 Inches, on the Line called 3d Variety, which added to 24, the Head-Diameter, 
gives 28. 57 Inches for the Cafk's mean Diameter: proceed as at firft, and you will find the 
Content of this Cafk to be 90.8 Ale Gallons. 

Laftly, If a Cafk, fuppole of the fame Dimenfions as before, is taken as the Fruftums of 
2 Cones, which is the fourth Variety, look on the other narrow Face of the Rule for 8 Inches* 
upon the Line of Inches ; and againft it, on the Line F. C, you will find 4.1 Inches, which 
added to 24, gives 28.1 for the mean Diameter of this Cafk: proceeding as at firft, and you 
will find the Content of this Calk, in Ale-Gallons, to be 87.93. 

USE XIV. There is a Cafk poftted with it's Axis parallel to the Horizon, or Lying, in part 
empty ; fuppofe it's Content is 97.455 Ale-Gallons, the Bung-Diameter 32 Inches, and the dry 
Inches 8, to find the Quantity of Liquor in the Cafk. 

As the Bung-Diameter upon C, is to 100 upon the Line of Segments L, So is the dry 
Inches on C, to a fourth Number on the Line of Segments : then As 100 upon B, is to the 
Calk s whole Content upon A, So is that fouith Number to the Liquor wanting to fill up the 
Cafk ; which, fubftrafted from the Liquor that the Cafk holds, gives the Liquor in the Cafk. 
Example; Set 32, the Bung-Diameter, on C, to 100 on the Segment Line L; then againft 
8, the Dry-Inches on C, Hands 17.6 on the Segment Line. Now fet 100 upon B, to the 
La k s whole Content upon A •, and againft 17.6 upon B, you have 16.5 Gallons upon A ; 
and iubftrafting the faid Gallons from 97.45, the Veffel's whole Content, the Liquor in the 
Cafk will be 80.95 Gallons. 

S /, E r XV * Su P°f e the tforefaid CajFs Axis be perpendicular to the Horizon, or upright, and 
the Length of it be 40 Inches : to find how much liquor there will be in the Cafk, when 10 
of thofe Inches are dry. 

II .Set

Set 40 Inches, the Length, on the Line C, to 100 on the Segment Line S ; and again ft 
10, the Dry-Inches, on the Line C, ftands 24.2 on the Segment Line S. Now fet 100 upon 
B, to 9J-4-55&gt; tne Cafk's whole Content, upon A ; and againft 24.2 on B, you will have 
23.5 Gallons, which are the Gallons wanting to fill up the Cafk, and being fubftracted from 
the whole Content 97-A-55-, gives 73-955 Gallons for the Quantity of Liquor remaining in the 
Cafk. 

USE XVI. To find the Content of any right-angled Parallelepipedon (which may repre- 
fent a Cijiern, or Uting-Fat) in Malt-Bujhels. 

Suppofe the Length of the Bafe is 80 Inches, the Breadth 50, and the Depth 9 Inches, 
Set the Breadth 50 on B, to the Depth 9 on C ; then againft the Length 80 on A, (lands 
16.8 Bufhels on the Line B, which are the Number of Bufhels of Malt contained in the afore* 
laid Ciftern. 

The broken Line of Numbers M. D, is fo fet under the Lines A or B, that any Number 
on A or B multiplied by the Number directly under it on the Line M D, will always be 
equal to 2150.42, the Number of Inches in a Malt-Bufhel : from whence the Reafon of the 
aforefaid Operation for finding the Number of Malt-Bufhcls, may be thus deduced. Let us 
call the Breadths, the Length £, the Depth c t and the Number of Inches in a Malt-Bufhel/; 

then the Malt-Bufhels in any Utenfil of the aforefaid Figure, will be expreffed by — j- . But 

by the Sliding- Rule the Operation is, to fet the Breadth a t to the Depth c j that is (from 

the aforementioned Property of the broken Line of Numbers M D), to — on the Line A j 

and then againft the Length £, on the Line A, will the Number of Malt-Bufhels Hand : 
therefore the Operation is but finding the fourth Term of this Analogy, by means of the

CHAP. IV. 

Of the ConftruEiion and Ufe of CoggediallV Sliding-Ruk 

for Meafuring, 

THIS Rule is framed three Ways •, for fome have the two Rulers compofing them 
Aiding by one another, like Glaziers Rules ; and fometimes there is a Groove made in 
one Side of a Two- Foot Joint-Rule, in which a thin fliding Piece being put, the Lines put 
upon this Rule, are placed upon the faid Side. And laftly, one Part Aiding in a Groove made 
along the Middle of the other, the Length of each of which is a Foot: the Form of this laft 
being reprefented by Fig. 12. 

Upon the Aiding Side of the Rule are four Lines of Numbers ; three are double Lines, or 
Lines of Numbers to two Radius's, and one a Angle broken Line of Numbers, marked by 
the Letters A, B, C, and D. 

The three double Lines of Numbers A, B, C, are figured 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ; and 
then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; they being the fame as the Line A, and the two Lines on 
the Sliding-Piece C, upon Everard\ Sliding- Rule i and their Conftruction, Ufe, and Manner 
of ufing, are alfo the fame. 

The fingle Line of Numbers D, whofe Radius is exactly equal to the two Radius's of ei- 
ther of the Lines of Numbers A, B, C, is broke, for eafier meafuring of Timber, and figured 
thus, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40 •, this Line is called the Girt Line : from 4 to 5 it is di- 
vided into 10 Parts, and each Tenth into two Parts, and fo on from 5 to 10 ; then from 10 
to 20, it is divided-into 10 Parts, and each Tenth into 4 Parts, and fo on from 20 to 40, at 
the End, which is right againft 10, at the End of either of the double Lines of Numbers. 

The Lines on the Back-fide of this Rule, are thefe; a Line of Inch-Meafure from 1 to 12, 
each Inch being fubdivided into Plalfs, Quarters, and Half-quarters : another Line of Inch- 
Meafure from 1 to 12, and each Inch fubdivided into 10 equal Parts : a Line of Foot-Mea- 
fure, being one Foot divided into 100 equal Parts, and figured, 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. to 100. 

The Back-fide of the Sliding-Piece is divided into Inches, Halfs, and Half-quarters, and 
figured from 12 to 24. ; fo that it may be Aid out to 2 Foot, to meafure the Length of any 
thing. 

The Lines of Numbers, A, B, or C, being either of them conftructed (which fee in the 
Chapter concerning Gunter's Scale) the Line D, from thence, may cafily be conftructed. 

For 



Chap. 4. of CoggefhallV Sliding-Rule. 27 

For havin* fet 4 dire&amp;ly under i, for the Beginning of the Line ; to find where any Divi- 
r fuppoftc, muft be placed, take twice the Diftance from 4 to 5, on either of the Ra- 
nk's of either of the Lines of Numbers A, B, C, and lay off from 4 that Extent, which 
will give the Divifion 5. Proceed thus for all the other Divifions and Subdivifions, by al- 
ways taking the double of them on the Lines A, B, or C. 

fate, For the manner of Notation, on this Rule, fee the Line of Numbers on the Car- 
penters. 

The Ufe of this Rule in meafuring plain Superficies. 
SECTION I. 
U S E I. To meafure a Geometrical Square. 
Let there be a Square whofe Sides are each 5 Feet •, fet 1 on the Line B, to 5 on the Line 
A ; then againft 5 on the Line B, is 25 Feet the Content of the Square on the Line A. 

U S E II. To meafure a right angled Parallelogram, or Long-Square. 
Lee there be a Parallelogram, whofe longeft Side is 18 Feet, and fhorteft 10 •, fet 1 on the 
Line B, to 10 on the Line A ; then againft 1 8 Feet on the Line B, is 180 Feet the Content 
on the Line A. 

USE III. To meafure a Rhombus. 
Let the Side of a Rhombus be 12 Feet, and the Length of a Perpendicular let fall from one 
of the obtufe Angles, to the oppofite Side, 9 Feet •, fet 1 on the Line B, to 12, the Length 
of the Side, on the Line A: then againft 9, the Length of the Perpendicular on the Line B, 
is 108 Feet the Content. 

USE IV. To meafure a Rhomboides. 
Suppofe the Length of either of the longeft Sides of a Rhomboides to be 25 Feet, and the 
Length of the Perpendicular let fall from one of the obtufe Angles to the oppofite longeft 
Side, is 8 Feet ; let 1 on the Line B, to 25, the Length, on the Line A j then againft 8 
Feet on the Line B, {lands 200 Feet the Content. 

USE W. To meafure a Triangle. 
Let the Bafe of a Triangle be 7 Feet, and the Length of the Perpendicular let fall from the 
oppofite Angle to the Bafe, 4 Feet. Set 1 on the Line B, to 7 on the Line A; then againft 
half the Perpendicular, which is 2, on the Line B, is 14 on the Line A, for the Content of 
the Triangle. 

USE VI. The Diameter of a Circle being given, to find it's Content. 

Let the Diameter of a Circle be %.$ Feet : fet 11 on the Girt-Line D, to g$ on the Line 
C -, then againft 3.5 Feet on u, is 9.6 on the Line C, which is the Content in Feet of the 
faid Circle. 

The Reafon of this Operation, is, that As the Square of 1 1, which is 121, is to 95 ; So is 
the Square of the Dumeter of any Circle, to it's Content. Alfo, from the Nature of the Lo- 
garithms, it is manifeft, if any Number, taken on a fingleLine of Numbers (whether whole 
or broken, in the manner that the Line D is), be fet to another Number, taken on a double 
Line of Numbers of the fame Length •, that the Square of the Number taken on the fingle 
Line of Numbers, will be to the Number it is fet againft-, on the double Line of Numbers, 
as the Square of any other Number, taken on the fingle Line of Numbers, to the Number 
againft it on the double Line of Numbers. 

USE VII. To find the Content of an Oval or Ellipjis. 

Let the Tranfverfe, or longeft Diameter, be 9 Feet, and the Conjugate, or fhorteft Dia- 
meter, 4 Feet - to find the Content of this Ellipfis. 

Theorem. The Content of every Ellipfis, is a mean Proportional between a Circle, whofe 
Diameter is qcjual to the longeft Diameter of the Ellipfis, and a Circle whofe Diameter is 
equal to th fhorteft Diameter of the fame Ellipfis ; as is manifeft per Cor. 3. Prop. XI. Lib. 1 1. 
of Sturmy's Mathefis Enucleata. 

Therefore a mean Proportional muft firft be found between 4 and 9, the longeft and fhorteft 
Diameters ; to do which by the Sliding-Rule, fet the greater of the two Numbers 9 on the 
Girt Line, to the fame Number on the Line C ; then againft the leffer Number 4, on the fame 
Line C, is 6 the mean Proportional fought on the Girt-Line. Now we have only the Con- 
tent of a Circle to find, whofe Diameter is 6 Feet •, which, when found, will be the Content 
of the Ellipfis fought : therefore (by the iaft Problem) fet 11 on the Girt-Line D, to 95 on 
the Line C; then againft 6 Feet on the Girt-Line D, ftands on the Line C, 28.28 Feet for 
the Content of the aforefaid Ellipfis. 

I he Reafon of the Operation for finding a mean Proportional between two Numbers, as 
4 and 9, is manifeft from what I faid in the laft Ufe of the Property of a double and fingle 

Line 



2,8 Of the Conftruciion and Ufes Book I. 

Line of Numbers Hiding by one another. And from this Theorem, viz. That if there are 
three Numbers continually proportional (as 4, 6, and 9), the Square of the greateft (as 81) is 
to the greateft (9), as the Square of the middle one (6), or the Rectangle under the Extremes 
(which is equal to it, per Prep. 20. Lib. 7. End.) is to the leffer Extreme (4). 

This Ufe may be eafier folved at one Operation by the Lines A and B, thus •, fct 1.27 
on the Line E, to the tranfverfe Axis 9 Feet, on the Line A : then againft the Conjugate 
Axis 4, on the Line B, ftands 28.28 Eeet on the Line A, for the Content. 

Note, The (landing Number 1.27, is the Quotient of 14 divided by 1 1 •, alfo as 14 is to 
11, lb is the Rectangle under the tranfverfe and conjugate Axes of any Ellipfis to it's Area j 
whence the Reafon of this Operation is eafily manifeft. 

SECTION II. 

Of ' meafuring Timber. 

USE I. To meafure Timber the common Way. 

Take the Length in Feet, Half-feet (and if defired), in Quarters ; then meafure half-way 
back again, where girt the Tree with a fmall Cord or Chalk- Line ; double this Line twice 
very even, and this fourth Part of the Girt, or Circumference, which is called the Girt, meafure 
in Inches, Halfs, and Quarters of Inches-, but the Length mull be given in Feet, and the 
Girt in Inches. The Dimenfions being thus taken, the Tree is to be meafured as fquare 
Timber, the Girt, or ~ of the Circumference being taken for the Side of the Square, in the 
following manner. 

Always fet 12 on the Girt-Line D, to the Length in Feet on the Line C ; then againft the 
Side of the Square, on the Girt-Line D, taken in Inches, you will find on the Line C the 
Content of the Tree in Feet. 

Example I. Suppofe the Girt of a Tree, in the middle, be 60 Inches, and the Length 30 
Feet, What is the Content? Set 12 on the Girt-Line D, to 30 Feet on the Line C •, then 
againft 15, the one fourth of 60, on the Girt-Line D, is 46.8 Feet the Content on the Line 
C. 

Example II. A Piece of Timber is 15 Feet long, and -i of the Girt 42 Inches : Set 12 on 
the Girt- Line D, to 15 on the fecond Radius of the Line C; then againft 42, at the Beginning 
of the Girt-Line D, is, on the Line C, 184 Feet, the Content fought. 

Example III. The Length of a Piece is 9 Inches, and a Quarter of the Girt %$ Inches, 
What is the Content ? Now, becaufe the Length is not a Foot, meafure it by your Line of 
Foot Meafure, and fee what decimal Part of a Foot it makes, which will be .75-, then fet 12 
on the Girt-Line, to 75 on the firft Radius of the Line C j and againft 35 on the Girt-Line 
D, is 6.4 Feet on the Line C, for the Content. 

Example IV. A Rail is 18 Feet long, and the Quarter of the Girt 3 Inches : fet 12 on the 
Girt-Line D, to 18 on the firft Radius of the Line C •, then againft 30, which mult be taken 
for 3, on the Girt-Line D, is juft 1.12 Feet for the Content. 

The Reafon of the Operations of this Ufe, is manifeft from what I faid about the Property 
of the Lines D and C, in Ufe VI. and this Theorem, viz. that as 144, the fquare Inches in 
a Foot, is to the Content of the Square Bafe of a Parallelopipedon taken in Inches ; that is, 
to the Square of * of the Girt : So is the Length of a Parallelopipedon taken in Feet, to the 
Solidity of the faid Parallelopipedon in Feet. 

This Ufe may be fooner done by taking all the Dimenfions in Foot Meafure thus, count 
10, 20, 30, 40, &amp;c. on the Girt-Line to be 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. and then place 10 on the Girt-Line 
D (now called 1) to the Length of the Tree on the Line C, and againft the Girt, in Foot Mea- 
fure, on the Girt-Line D, ftands the Content on the Line C. 

Example I. Let the Length of a Tree be, as in the firft Example foregoing, viz. 30 Feet, 
and the Girt 60 Inches, or 5 Feet, What is the Content? Set 10 (now called 1) on the Girt- 
Line D, to 30 Feet on the Line C ; then againft 1.25 Feer, the one fourth of the Girt, on the 
Girt-Line 13, ftands 46.8 Feet on the Line C, for the Content, as before. 

Example II. A Piece of Timber is 15 Feet long, and one fourth of the Girt is 42 Inches, 
or 3.5 Feet, What is the Content? 

Set 10 on the Girt-Line, to 15 on the firft Radius of the Line C ; then againft 3.5 Feet on 
the Girt-Line, is 184 Feet on the Line C, the Content required. 

Example III. A Length is 9.75 Feet, and ' of the Girt 39 Inches, or 3 Feet r *-| fet 10 
on the Girt-Line to 9.75 on the Line Cj and againft 3.2J Feet, on the Girt-Line J), is be- 
yond ico on the Line C : in this Cafe take half the Length, and then the CJntent found 
muft be doubled, as here: 

Set 10 on the Girt-Line, to (half of 9.75) 4.S7 ; and then againft 3.25 is 51./,' ; the dou- 
ble or which is 103 Feer, the Concent required. 

Note, If the Content of any Piece of Timber in Feet, be divided by 50, you have the Con- 
tent in Loads : but fome will have a Load to be bur 40 fo'id Feet -, therefore you may take 
which of the two is molt cuitomaiv with you. 



Chap 4* of Cog*&amp;\d\¥s S/iding-Ruk. 29 

USE II. To meafure Round Timber the true -way. 

The manner of meafuring Round Timber in the lad Ufe, being the common way, but 
not the true one, a? I have already laid in (peaking of the Carpenter's Rule: I fhall now give 
you a Point on the Girt-Line D, which mud be ufed inftead of 12, which is 10.635, at 
which there ought to oe placed a little Brafs Center-Pin: this 10.635 is the Side of a Square, 
equal to aCircie, whofe Diameter is 12 Inches. 

Example. Let a L&lt; rigth be (as in the f cond Example of the laft Ufe) 15 Feet, and the 
1 of the Girt 42 Inches : let the faid Point 10.635, t0 l 5 tne Length ; then againft 42, at the 
Beginning of the Gut Line, is 233 Feet for the Content fought : but by the common way, 
there anies only 184 Feet. 

Note, As trie Area, or Content of a Circle (in Inches) whofe Diameter is 12 Inches, is to 
the Length of any Cylinder in Feet ; So is the Square of of the Circumference of the Bafe of 
the Cylinder, in Indies, to tne (olid Content of the Cylinder in Feet. 

Alfo the common Meafure is to the true Meafure, as u is to 14; that is, as the Area, or 
Content of a Circle, to the Squire of it's Diameter; which, from hence, will be eafily mani- 
felt : Call the Diameter of any Circle D, and 4- the Circumference C ; then the Content of 
the faid Circle will be equal toDxC; therefore DxC is to DxD, as 11 is to 14. But the 
common Meafure (becaufe the Length of the Piece is the fame) will be to the true Meafure, 
as C C, the Square of the Circumference, to D&lt;C the Content of the faid Circle ; whence 
D xC niuft be to D \ as C is to D x C; and by comparing the Rectangles under the Means 
and Extremes, they will be found equal •, therefore what I propofed is true. 

If the Girt of a Piece of Timber be taken in Feet, the oint for true Meafure is .886, or 
.89, which is the Side of a Square, equal to the Content of a Circle, whofe Diameter is 
Unity And then, for the foregoing Example, the Length being 15 Feet, and [ of the Girt 
42 Inches; fet the aforefaid Point 89 on the Girt-Line, to the Length 15 Feet on the Line 

C, (in the fir ft Radius) then againft 3.5 Feet (which is 35) on the Girt-Line D, is 233 Feet 
on the Line C, the true Content required. 

USE III. To meafure a Cube. 

Let there be a Cube whofe Sides are 6 Feet ; to find the Content: fet 12 on the G'rt-Line 

D, to 6 on the Line C ; then againft 72 Inches (the Inches in 6 Feet) on the Gin Luk D, is 
216 Feet on the Line C, which is the Content required. 

USE IV. To meafure unequal fqttared Timber ; that is, if the Breadth and Depth are 

not equal. 

Meafure the Length of the Piece, and th&lt; Breadth and Depth (at the End; in L cries ; then 
find a mean Proportional between the breadth and Depth of the Piece; Which n.e*n Propor- 
tional is the Side of a Square equal to the End of the Piece : which being found, trie iiece 
may be 'meafurcd as fqu are Timber. 

Example I. Ls t there be a Piece of Timber whofe Length is 13 Feet, the Bre tdth 23 In- 
ches, and the Eepth 13 Inches: fet 23 on the Girt-Line D, to 23 on tne Line C ; men a- 
gainft 13 on the Line C, is 17.35 on the Girt-Line D for the mean Proportional. Now 
again ; letting 12 on the Girt Line D, to 13 Feet, the Length, on the Line C ; then againft 
17.35 on tne Girt-Line D, is 27 Feet the Content required. 

Example II. Let there be a Piece of Stone 7.4 Feet in Length, 30 Inches in Breadth, and 
23 5 Deep: fet 30 Inches on the Girt-Line D, to 30 on the LineC; then againft 23.5, on 
the Line C, is 26.5 on the Gut-Line D ; then let 12 on the Girt-Line D, to 7.4 on the Line 
C; and againft 26.5, on the Girt Line, is 36 Feet the Content fought. 

USE V. To find the Content of a Piece of Timber in Form of a triangular Prifm. 

You mull fir ft find a mean Proportional between the Bafe, and half the Perpendicular of 
the triangular End, or between the Perpendicular and half the Bafe, both meafured in Inches, 
and tiiat mean Proportional will be the Side of a Square equal to the Triangle. e 

Then to find the Content, fet 12 on the Girt-Line D, to the Length in Feet on the Line 
of Numbers C ; and againft the mean Proportional on the Girt-Line D, is the Content on 
the Line of Numbers C. 

But the Dimcnfions being all taken in Foot-Meafure, and the mean Proportional found in 
the fame ; then let 1 on the Girt-Line, to the Length on the Line C; and againft the mean 
Proportional in the Girt-Line, is the Content in the Line C. 

Example There is a Piece of Timber 19 Feet 6 Inches in Length, the Bafe of the Triangle 
at each End 21 Inches, and the Perpendicular 16 Inches : to find the Content. 

Set 2 1 Inches on the Girt-Line D, to 2 1 on the Line C ; then againft 8 on the Line C, is 
12.95 on the Line D, the mean Proportional ; then fet 12 on the Line D, to 19.5 Feet the 
Length, on the Line C ; and againft 12.95 (the mean Proportional) on the Girt-Line D, is 
22.8 Feet the Content on the Line C. Or thus, take all the Dimensions in Foot-Meafure, 
and then the Length 19 Feet 6 Inches, is 19.5, the Bafe 21 Inches, is 1.75, and the Perpen- 
dicular 16 Inches, is 1.33. Now fet 1 on the Girt-Line D, to the Length 19.5 on the 

I double 



o Of the Conftruciion and Ufes Book I. 

double Line C; and againft 1.08 on the Girt-Line D, is 22.8 Feet on the Line C, for the 
Content. 

USE VI. To meafure Taper Timber, 

The Length being meafured in Feet, note one third of it, which may be found thus : fet 
3 on the Line A, to the Length on the Line B ; then againft 1 on the Line A, is the third 
Part on the Line B : then if the Solid be round, meafure the Diameter at each End in Inches, 
and fubftract the leifer Diameter from the greater, and add half the Difference to the lefTer 
Diameter, the Sum is the Diameter in the middle of the Piece ; then fet 13.54 on the Girt- 
Line D, to the Length on the LineC; and againft the Diameter in the middle, on the Girt- 
Line, is a fourth Number on the Line C. Again; fet 13.54 on the Girt-Line, to the third 
part of the Length on the Line C : then againft half the Difference on the Girt-Line, is an- 
other fourth Number on the Line C ; thefe two fourth Numbers added together, will give 
the Content. 

Example. Let the Length be 27 Feet (one third of which will be 9), the greater Diame- 
ter 22 Inches, and the lefTer 18, the Sum of the greater and lefTer Diameters will be 40 ; 
their Difference 4, half their Difference 2, which added to the lt-ffer Diameter, gives 20 
Inches for the Diameter in the middle of the Piece. Now fet 13.54 on the Girt-Line D, to 
27 on the LineC ; and againft 20 on the Line D, is 58.9 Feet. Again, fet 13.54 °f tne 
Girt-Line, to 9 on the Line C ; then againft 2 on the Girt-Line (reprefented by 20), is .196 
Parts: therefore, by adding 58.9 Feet, to .196 Feet, the Sum is 59.096 Feet the Contenr. 
If all the Dimenfions are taken in Foot- Meafure, then you muft add the greater and lefTer 
Diameters together, which in this Example make 3.33 Feet ; half of which is the Diameter 
in the middle of the Piece, viz. i.6j Feet, the Difference of the Diameters is 0.33 Fttx, half 
of which Difference is o. 1 7 Feet. 

Then fet 1.13 on the Girt-Line, to the Length 27 Feet on the Line C ; and againft 1.67 
on the Line D, is 58.9 Feet : then again, fet 1.13 on the Line D, to 9 Feet on tf Line C ; 
and then againft 0.17 on the Line D, is 196 Parts of a Foot, and both .1 ,.ed togt .her is the 
Content; that is, 58.9 and .196 added, makes 59.096 Feet as Iv-fort 

If the Solid is fquare, and has the fame Dimenfions ; that is, the Length 27 Feet, the Side 
of the greater End 22 Inches, and the Side of the lefTer End 18 Inches, to find tl, - Content 
in Inch- Meafure: fet 12 on the Girt-Line, to 27 the Length of the Solid, on the Line C; 
and againft 20 Inches, the Side of the mean Square on the Girt-Line, is 75.4 T eet. Again ; 
fet 12 on the Girt-Line, to 9 Feet, one third of the Length, on the Line C; and ngainft 2 
Inches, half the Difference of the Sides of the Squares of the Ends, on the Girt-Lii e, is .25 
Parts of a Foot; both together is ys-^5 Feet the Content of the Solid : 01 thus, When all the 
Dimenfions are taken in Foot- Meafure, fet 1 on the Girt-Line, to the Lengtn 27 Feet on the 
Line C; then againft 1.67 Feet, the Side of the middle Square on the Girt-Line-, ftands 75.4 
Feet ; and fetting 1 on the Girt-Line to 9 Feet, one third of che Length on the Line C, 
againft 0.167, half the Difference of the Sides of the Squares of the Ends on the Girt-Line, 
is on the Line C, .25 Parts of a Foot; which added to the other, makes 75.65 Feet, as be- 
fore, for the Content. 

Note, The fixed Numbers 13.54, and 1.13 are, the firft, the Diameter of a Circle whofe 
Area, or Content is 144 ; that is, the Number of fquare Inches in a fuperficial Foot ; and the 
other, the Diameter of a Circle whofe Area is Unity. 

USE VII. To find how many Inches in Length will make a Foot- Solid, at any Girt, be- 
ing the Side of a Square not exceeding 40 Inches. 

Let the Girt, or Side of the Square, taken upon the Girt-Line, be fet to 1 on the Line 
C: then againft 41.57 of the Girt-Line, is the Number of Inches on the Line C, that will 
make a Solid-Foot. 

Example. Let the Side of a Square be 8 Inches: fet 8 on the Girt-Line D, to 1 on the 
Line C ; then againft 41.57 on the Girt-Line D, is 27 Inches for the Length of one folid 
Foot. To do this in Foot-Meafure ; the Side of the Square 8 Inches, in Foot- Meafure, is 
.66 Parts, which taken on the Girt-Line, and being fet to 1 on the Line C, againft 1 on the 
Girt-Line, is 2.25 Feet, for the Length to make one Foot of Timber. 

Note, 41.57 is the Square-Root of 1728, the Number of Cubic Inches in a folid Foot. 

USE VIII. The Diameter of a Circle, or round Piece of Timber, being given : to find the Side 
of a Square within the Circle ; or to know how many Inches the Side of the Square will be, 
when the round Timber is fquared. 

Rule. Set 8.5 on the Line A, to 6 on the Line B ; then againft the Diameter on the Line 
A, is the Side of the Square on the Line B. 

Example. Let the Diameter be 18 Inches: fet 8.^ on A, to 6 on B ; then againft 18 on A, 
is nion the Line B, for the Side of a Square within the Circle. The fame done in Foot- 
Meafure: the Diameter being 18 Inches, is in Foot-Meafure 1.5 -, then fet 1 on the Line A, 
to .707 on the Line B; and againft the Diameter 1.5 on the Line A, is 1.7 on the Line B ; 
that is, 1.7 Foot is the Side of an inferibed Square in a Circle, whofe Diameter is 1.5 Foot.

Let the Girt be 12 Inches ; fet 10 on the Line A, to 9 on the Line B ; then againfl: 12 
on the Line A, is 10.8 on the Line B, for the Side of the Square. By Foot-Meafure it is 
thus; the Girt 12 Inches is one Foot ; then fet 10 on the Line A, to 9 on the Line B •, and 
againfl the ' ~t 1 Foot, on the Line A, is .89 Parts of a Foot for the Side of the Square 
within.

Of the ConfiruSiion and Ufes of the Plotting Scale, and an 

improved Protractor 

Tip FIE Plotting-Scale is generally made of Box- Wood, and form times of Brafs, Ivory, or 
_j[ Silver, exactly a Foot, or half a Foot in Length, about an Inch and a half-broad, and 
of a convenient Thicknefs : Thofe that are but half a Foot long, have that Length given 
them, that thereby they may be put into Cafes of Inftruments, 
Plate 4. On one Side of this Scale is placed feven feveral Scales of Lines, five of which are di- 

Fig. 1. vided into as many equal Parts as the Length of the Plotting-Scale will permit. The other 

two are likewife equal Parts, but have two Lines of Chords of different Lengths joined to 
them. The firft of the equal Divifions, on the firft Scale of Lines, is fubdivided into :o 
equal Parts, at the Beginning of which is fet the Number 10 •, fignifying, that ten of thofe 
Subdivifions make an Inch : that is, in this Cafe, every of the Divifions on the firft Scae, is 
exactly an Inch •, at the End of the firft of which, is fet o ; at the End of the fecond 1 ; 
at the End of the third 2 ; and fo on to the End of the Scale. The firft of the equal Di- 
vifions, on the fecond Scale of Lines, which are leffer than the Divifions on the firft S&lt; aie, 
is likewife fubdivided into 10 equal Parts, and hath the Number 16 fet at the Beginning of 
it, fignifying, that 16 of thofe Subdivifions make an Inch, or one of the Divifions -^ of an 
Inch j at the End of the firft of which is placed o ; at the End of the fecond 1 ; at the 
End of the third 2 : and fo on to the End of the Scale. The firft of the equ.i, Divifions on 
the third Scale of Lines, which are leffer than the Divifions of the precedent Scale's, is alio 
fubdivided into 10 equal Parts ; at the Beginning of which is fet the Number 20 •, fignify- 
ing, that 20 of thofe Subdivifions go to make an Inch, or that one of the Divifions is ' | 
or 4 of an Inch, which Divifions are marked, o, 1, 2, 3, and fo on to the End of the Scale, 
Underftand the fame for the other four Scales, at the Beginnings of which are writ, 24, 32, 
40, 48 ; only the Divifions of the two laft Scales of Lines are not continued to the F'nd of 
the Scale, becaufe of two Lines of Chords of different Lengths, the Beginnings of which 
are marked by the Letters C, C, fignifying Chords. The Conftruction of which fee in the 
nexc Chapter. 

Note, Each of the aforefaid Scales of Lines are aptly diftinguifhed from one another, by 
being called Scales of 10, 16, 20, 24, 32, or 48, in an Inch; as the firft Scale, is a Scale of 
10 in an Inch ; the fecond, 16 in an Inch -, the third, 20 in an Inch ; the fourth, 24 ; and 
fo on. 
Fig. 2. On the back Side of this Scale, is placed a Diagonal Scale ; the firft of whofe Divifions, 

which is half an Inch, if the Scale is a Foot long-, and one fourth, if the Scale is hut half 
a Foot long, is diagonally fubdivided into 100 equal Parts. Alfo at the other End of the 
Scale is another Diagonal Subdivifion of an Inch into 100 equal Parts, if the Scale is a loot 
long ; but if it is haif a Foot, the Subdivifion is of half an Inch into 100 equal Parts. The 
Figure of this Diagonal Scale, and what our Author has already faid of it, in Ufe 8, is fuffi- 
cient to fliew it's Conftruclion and Ufe. 

There is alfo next to the Diagonal Scale, a Foot divided into 100 equal Parts, if the Scale is 
a Foot long, every 10 of which are numbered 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. There is likewife next to 
that the Divifions of Inches, numbered, 1,2, 3, £srV. each of which is fubdivided into ten 
equal Parts.

USE I. Any Difiance being meafured by your Chain, to lay it down upon Paper. 

Suppofe, that meafuring along a Hedge, or the Diftance between any two Marks, or Fig. 3. 
Places, with your Chain, you find the Length thereof to contain 6 Chains, 50 Links. Now 
to take this Diftance from your Scale, and lay it down upon Paper, do thus : 

Firft draw the Line A B, then place one Foot of your CompafTes upon your Scale at the 
Fi'Hire 6, for the 6 Chains, and extend the other Foot to 5 of the Subdivifions (which re- 
presents the 50 Links), then ftt this Diftance upon the Line drawn from A to B, and the 
Line A B will contain 6 Chains, 50 Links, if you take the Diftance from the Scale of 10 in 

But if you would have the Line fhorter, and yet to contain 6 Chains 50 Links, then take 
your Diftance from a fmaller Scale, as of 16, 20, 24, &amp;c. in an Inch, and then the 6 Chains, 
co Links, will end at C : if taken from the Scale of 16 in an InCh ; or at D, if taken from 
the Scale of 20 in an Inch, &amp;c. either of which Lines will contain 6 Chains, 50 Links, and 
be proportional one to another, as the Scales from which they were taken. And in this 
manner any Number of Chains and Links may be taken from any of the Scales. 

U S E II. A right Line being given, to find how many Chains and Links are therein con- 
tained, according to any affigned Scale. 

Suppofe A B was a given Line, and it is required to find how many Chains and Links are Fig. j- 
contained therein, according to the Scale of 10 in an Inch : Take in your CompafTes the 
Length of the Line A B, and applying it to the Scale of 10 in an Inch, you will find that the 
Extent of your CompafTes will reach from 6 of the great Divifions, to 5 of the fmall ones ; 
whence the Line A B, contains 6 Chains, 50 Links. The like muft be done for any Line, and 
alfo by any of the other Scales. 

But note, that in laying down the Lengths of Lines by your Scales, whatfoever Scale you 
begin your Work with, with the fame Scale you muft continue it to the End, not laying 
down one Line by one Scale, and another by another •, but if you would have a large Work in 
a little room, then ufe a fmall Scale, as of 32, 40, or 48 in an Inch. But contrariwife, if you 
would exprefs every fmall Particular, then it is beft to ufe the Scales of 10, or 16 in an Inch. 

The Ufe of the Lines of Chords on the Plotting-Scale, is to protracT or lay down Angles, 
when a ProtracTor is wanting, which is much more convenient in -laying off Angles : vide Ufes 
of the Plain-Scale. To take off Parts from the Diagonal Scale, fee Ufe VIII. of our Author's. 

Of the Conftruftion and Ufe of an improved ProtracJor. 

This Protractor is made of Brafs, as the others commonly are, and has likewife it's Semi- Fig. 4. 
circular Limb divided into 180 Degrees-, there is an Index adjufted in the Center of this 
ProtracTor, by means of which, an Angle of any Number of Degrees and Minutes, may 
be protracTed : there is a Circle cut out in the Piece, whofe Edge, next to the Limb, ferves 
for the Diameter of the Semicircle •, the Center of this Circle is in the Center of the Limb, 
and it is cut (loping, fo that it makes the Fruflum of a Cone, the greateft Bafe being un- 
derneath. In this Circle is adjufted a Ring, to which the Ring of the End of the Index is 
riveted ; by which means the Index will move freely about the Limb. There is a little Steel 
Point fixed to the Ring, adjufted in the aforefaid Circle, the End of which terminates in the 
Center of the Circle ■, the End of this Point muft be laid to the angular Point to be pro- 
trafted. 

The Index confiffs of two Pieces, one End of that which comes out beyond the Limb of 
the ProtracTor is cut flopewife, fo as exacTly to fit the Edge of the Limb of the ProtracTor, 
which is likewife doped underneath, and is fattened to the other Piece ; by which means the 
Index is kept down clofe to the Limb. 

The Divifions on both Edges of that Part of the Index beyond the Limb, are 60 equal 
Parts of the Portions of Circles (pafTing thro' the Center of the ProtracTor, and two Points 
aifumed in the outward Edge of the Limb ©f that Piece of the Index nigheft the Center), in- 
tercepted by two other right Lines drawn from the Center •, fo that they each make, with 
Lines drawn to the affumed Points from the Center, Angles of one Degree. 

To lay off any Number of Degrees and Minutes by this ProtracTor, you muft move the 
Index, fo that one of the Lines drawn upon the Limb, from one of the aforementioned Points, 
may be upon the Number of Degrees fought •, and then pricking off as many of the equal 
Parts on the proper Edge of the Index, as there are Minutes given, and drawing a Line from 
the Center, to that Point fo pricked off, you will have an Angle, with the Diameter of the 
ProtracTor, of the propofed Number of Degrees or Minutes. The reafon of this Contri- 
vance is from Prop. 27. Lib. 3. Eucl. where it is proved that Angles infifting upon the fame 
Arcs, in equal Circles, or in the fame Circle (for it is the fame thing), are equal.

CHAP. VI. 

The Proje&amp;ion of the Pluin-Scale. 

Fig. s» 6. TJ&gt; I R S T, draw a Circle A B D C, which crofs at right Angles with the Diameters A D, 
£/ C B -, then continue out A D to G, and upon the Point B, raife B F perpendicular to 
C B. Now draw the Chord AB, and divide the Quadrant A B into 9 equal Tarts, fetting 
the Figures 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. to 90 to them; each of which 9 Parts again fubdivide into 10 
more equal Parts, and then the Quadrant will be divided into 90 Degrees. Now fetting one 
Foot of your CompafTes in the Point A, transfer the faid Divifions to the Chord Line A B, 
and fet thereto the Figures 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. and the Line of Chords A B, will be divided, 
and then may be put upon your Scale, reprefented in Fig. 6. Now to project the Sines, di- 
vide the Arc BD into 90 Degrees, as before you did A B •, from every of which Degrees, let 
fall Perpendiculars on the Semidiameter E B ; which Perpendiculars will divide E B into a Line 
of Sines, to which you muft fet 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. beginning from the Center, and then you may 
transfer the Line of Sines to your Scale. 

Again, to project the Line of Tangents •, from the Center E, and thro' every Divifion of 
the Arc BD, draw right Lines cutting BF, which will divide it into a Line of Tangents, 
fetting thereto the Numbers 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. which you muft transfer to your Scale. 

To project the Line of Secants, transfer the Diftances E 10, E 20, E 30, &amp;c. that is, the 
Diftance from E to 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. on the Tangent Line, upon the Line EG, and fetting 
thereto the Numbers 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. the Line EG will be divided into a Line of Secants, 
which muft be transferred on the Scale. 

To project the Semi-tangents •, draw Lines from the Point C, thro' every Degree of the 
Quadrant A B, and they will divide the Diameter AE into a Line of Semi-tangents: but be- 
caufe the Semi-tangents, or Plane-Scales of a Foot in Length, run to 160 Degrees, continue 
out the Line A E, and draw Lines from the Point C, thro' the Degrees of the Quadrant C A, 
cutting the faid continued Portion of A E, and you will have a Line of Half-tangents to 160 
Degrees, or further, if you pleafe. 

Note, The Semi-tangent of any Arc, is but the Tangent of half that Arc, as will eafily ap- 
pear from it's manner of Projection, and Prop. 20. Lib. 3. End. where it is proved, that an 
Angle at the Center, is double to one at the Circumference. 

Moreover, to draw the Rhumb-Line ; from every 8th part of the Quadrant A C, fetting 
one Foot of your CompafTes in A, defcribe Arcs cutting the Chord A C, which will divide 
A C into a Line of whole Rhumbs, dnd in the fame Manner may theSubdivilions of half and 
quarter Rhumbs be made. 

Laftly, to project the Line of Longitude •, draw the Line HD, equal and parallel to the 
Radius CE, which divide into 60 equal Parts (becaufe 60 Miles make a Degree of Longi- 
tude under the Equator), every 10 of which Number fet Figures to. Now from every of 
thofe Parts, let fall Perpendiculars to CE, cutting the Arc CD -, and having drawn the 
Chord C D, with one Foot of your CompafTes in D, transfer the Diitances from D, to each of 
the Points in the Arc CD, on the Chord CD, and fet thereto the Numbers 10, 20, &amp;c. and 
the Line of Longitude will be divided, 

The Reafon of this Conftruction is, that As Radius is to the Sine Complement of any La- 
titude, So is the Length of a Degree of Longitude under the Equator,' which is 60 Miles, to 
the Length of a Degree of Longitude in that Latitude. 

Thefe being all the Lines commonly put upon the Rulers, called Plain-Scales, excepting 
equal Parts ; therefore I fhall proceed to fhew their manner of ufing in Trigonometry, and 
Spherical Geometry. 

But, by the way, note, That Plain-Scales are commonly of thefe two Lengths, viz. fome 
one foot long, and others, which are put into Cafes of Inftruments, but half a foot in 
Length ; and on one Side is a Diagonal Scale: they are generally made of Box, and fome- 
times of Brafs or Ivory. 

USE I. To make an Angle in the Point A, at the End of the Line A B, of any Number 

of Degrees, fuppoje 40. 

FJg. 7. Take in your CompafTes 60 Degrees from the Line of Chords, and letting one Foot in, 

the Point A, defcribe the Arc CB; then take 40 Degrees, which is the Number propofed, 
from the fame Line of Chords, and lay them off on the Arc from B to E ; draw the Line 
A E, and the Angle B A E will be 40 Degrees, as is manifeft from the Conftruction oi the 
Line of Chords, and Prop. 15. Lib. 4. Eucl. which fhews that the Semidiameter of any Circle, 
is equal to the Side of a Hexagon inferibed in the fame Circle ; that is, to the Chord of Co 
Degrees. 

USE 



Chap. 6 . of the Plain-Scale. 3 5 

U S E II. The Angle EAB being given, to find the Quantity of Degrees it contains. 
Take in your Compaffes 60 Degrees from the Line of Chords, and defcribe the Arc B C ; Fig. 7. 
then take the Extent from B to E in the Compaffes ; which Extent apply on the Line of 
Chords, and the Quantity of the Angle will be fhewn. This Ufe, which is only the Re- 
verfe of the former, may be likewife done by the Lines of Sines and Tangents, the Method 
of doing which is enough manifeft from Ufe I. 

USE III. The Safe of a Triangle being given 40 Leagues, the Angle A B C 3 6 Degrees, and 
the Angle B A C 41 Degrees ; to make the Triangle, find the Lengths of the Sides AC, C B, 
and alfo the other Angle. 

Draw the indefinite right Line AD, and take the Extent of 40 Leagues, from the Line Fig. 8. 
of Leagues, between your Compaffes, which lay off upon the faid Line from A to B for the 
Bafe of the Triangle •, at the Points A and B make, by Ufe I. the Angles ABC, BCA; 
the firft 36 Degrees, and the laft 41 Degrees, and the Triangle A C B will be formed ; then 
take in your Compaffes the Length of the Side A C, and apply it to the fame Scale of 
Leagues, and you will find it's Length to be 24 Leagues. Do thus for the other Side B C, 
and you will find it 27 Leagues and a half j and, by Ufe II. the Angle AC B will be found 
103 Degrees. 

By this Ufe the following Problem in Navigation may be folved, viz. Two Ports, both 
lying under the fame Meridian, being any Number of Miles diftant from each other, fuppofe 
co, and the Pilot of a Ship, out at Sea on a certain time, finds the Bearing of one of the 
Ports is S W by S, and the Bearing of the other N W : the Ship's Diftance from each of the 
Ports at that time is required ? 

To iblve this Problem •, draw the right Line A B equal to 3 Inches, or 3 of the largeft 
equal Parts on the Diagonal Scale, which is to reprefent the 30 Miles, or the Diftance from 
one of the Ports, as A to the other B ; at the Point B make an Angle, equal to the bearing Fig. 9. 
of the Port B from the Ship, which muft be 33 Degrees, 45 Minutes ; likewife make an- 
other Angle at the Point A, equal to the Bearing of the Port A from the Ship, which muft be 
45 Degrees, then the Point C will be the Place the Ship was in at the time of Obfervation. 

Now to find the Diftance of the Ship from the Port A, take the Length of the Side A C 
in your Compaffes, and applying it to the Diagonal Scale, you will find it to be 17 -,'- Miles. 
In the fame manner the Diftance of the Ship, from the Port B, will be found 214 (Miles. 

Note, The Reafon why the Angles A and B are equal to the Bearing of the Ship from each 
of thofe Ports, depends on Prop. 29. lib. 1. Eucl. 

USE IV. The Bafe A B of a Triangle being given 60 Leagues, the oppejite Angle A C B 108 Fig. 10. 

Degrees, and the Side C B 40 Leagues ; to make the faid Triangle, and find the Length of the 
other Side A C. 

Draw the Line a b equal to A B, the given Bafe •, and becaufe in any Triangle the Sines Fig. 11. 
of the Sides are proportionable to the Sines of the oppofite Angles (as is demonftrated by 
Trigonometrical Writers), it follows, that As A B is to the Sine of the given Angle C, which 
is of 72 Degrees, viz. the Complement of 108 Degrees to 180 ; So is the given Side B C, to 
the Sine of the Angle CAB: therefore make be equal to the given Side BC of 40 Leagues. 
Take in your Compaffes, upon the Line of Sines, the Sine of 72 Degrees, to which Length 
make b e equal, -and draw the Line a c ; likewife draw e d parallel to a c, and (by Prop. 4. 
lib. 6. Eucl.) bd will be the Sine of the Angle CAB, which will be found, by applying it 
to the Line of Sines, about 39 Degrees : therefore make an Angle at the Point A of 39 
Degrees, then take in your Compaffes the Length 40 Leagues, and fetting one Foot in the 
Point B, with the other defcribe an Arc, which will cut the Side A C in the Point C, and 
confequently the Triangle A B C will be made, and the Length of the Side AC will be 
found 34 Leagues. 

USE V. Concerning the Line of Rhumbs. 

The Ufe of the Line of Rhumbs is only to lay off, or meafure, the Angles of a Ship's Courfe 
in Navigation, more expeditioufly than can be done by the Line of Chords : As fuppofe a 
Ship's Courfe is N N E, it is required to lay it down. 

Draw the Line AB, reprefenting the Meridian -, take 60 Degrees from the Line of Chords, Fig, 12. 
and about the Point A defcribe the Arc B C. Now becaufe N N E is the third Rhumb from 
the North, therefore take the third Rhumb in your Compaffes, on the Line of Rhumbs, 
and lay it off upon the Arc from BtoC; draw the Line A C, and the Angle B A C will 
be the Courfe. 

USE VI. Of the Line of Longitude. 
The Ufe of this Line is to find in what Degrees of Latitude a Degree of Longitude is 
i» -, 3, 4, iyc. Miles, which is eafily done by means of the Line of Chords next to it: for it 
is only iccing what Degree of the Line of Chords anfwers to a propofed Number of Miles, 
and that Degree will be the Latitude, in which a Degree of Longitude is equal to that pro- 
pofed

Decree of Longitude is 10 Miles. Again, 30 Miles on the Line of Longitude, anlwers to 
60 Decrees on the Line of Chords-, therefore in the Latitude of 60 Degrees, a Degree of 
Longitude is 30 Miles. Moreover, againft 58 Miles, on the Line of Longitude, (lands 15 
Deuces of the Line of Chords, which (hews that a Degree of Longitude, in the Latitude or 
15 Deg. is 58 Miles ; and lb for others. 

USE of the Plain-Scale in Spherical Geometry. 
U S E I. To find the Pole of any Great Circle. 

If the Pole of the Primitive Circle be required, it is it's Center. 

If the Pole of a rbht or perpendicular Circle be fought, it is 90 Degrees diftant, reckoned 
upon the Limb fronfthe Points, where this Circle, which is a Diameter, cuts it. 

If the Pole of an oblique Circle be required, &gt; 

(1 ) Confider that this Circle muft cut the primitive in two Points, that will be dittant 
from each other juft a Diameter, as is the Cafe of the Interferon of all great Circles. 

(2 ) The Pole of this Circle muft be in a right Line, perpendicular to it s Plane. 

(3.) This Circle's Pole cannot but lie between the Center of the primitive one, and its 

own. . , 

Fi c 1, Example. Let the Pole of the oblique Circle A B C be required, 

1. Draw the Diameter AC, and then another, as D E, perpendicular to it. 

2. Lay the Edge of your Scale from A to B, it will cut the Limb in F ; then take the 
Chord of 90 Degrees, and let it from F to h. ,.,..„. .. 

3. Lay the Edge of your Scale from h to A, it will cut D E in g , which Point g is the 

Pole required. , . _ . . . . ^. , , . .• 

Note, To find the Points F and b, is called reducing B to the primitive Circle and to the 
Diameter. Alfo, Note, that every of the primitive Circles in this Ufe , and the following 
ones, are fuppofed to be defcribed from 60 Degrees, taken off from the letter Line or Chords 
on the Scale. 

U S E II. To defcribe a Spherical Angle of any Number of given Degrees. 
1. If the angular Point be at the Center of the primitive Circle, then it :isat any plane 
Angle, numbering the Degrees in the Limb from the Line of Chords • for all Circles paffing 
through the CenteT, and which are at right Angles with the Limb, muft be projected into right 

T^f the Angle given is to be defcribed at the Periphery of the primitive Circle, draw a 
Diameter as AC (then take the Secant of the Angle given in your CompaiTes, and fitting 
one Foot in A, crofs the Diameter in e : or if no Diameter be drawn, placing one Foot in C 
and croffina the former Arc, you will find the fame Point e, which is the Center of the Circle 
ArfC, which, with the primitive Circle, makes the Angle DA a required. 

Note If the Ancrle given be obtufe, take the Secant of it's Supplement to 180 Degrees. 

2 If a Point, as%, were affigned, through which the Arc of the Circle confhtut.ng the 
Angle muft pals, draw the Diameter A C (as before) then take the Secant of the given Angle, 
and fetting one Foot in A or C, ftrike an Arc as at t, and then with the Secant of the given 
Angle, fetting one Foot in a, crofs the other Arc in e ; which will be the Center of the ob- 
lique Circle required. 

USE III. To draw a great Circle through any tzvo Points given, as a and b, within 

the primitive one. 
Fig , 4 Draw a Diameter through that Point which is furtheft from the Center, as D R, producing 

it beyond the Limb if there be Occafion ; fet 90 Degrees of Chords from D or R, to O, and 

Then^erecT: O H perpendicular to a O, and produce it 'till it cuts the Diameter prolonged 
in H-, that Interferon H is a third Point, through which, as alfo a and b, if a Circe be 
drawn, it will be a great Circle, zseab g. . . 

Which is eafily pToved, by drawing the Lines eCg; for that Line is a Diameter, becaufe 
it's Parts, multiplied into one another, are equal to a c x C H, equal to O C fquared. Per 
Prop. 35. Ub. 3. &amp;? Cor oil 8. lib. 6. End. 

USE IV. To draw a great Circle perpendicular to, or at right Angles to another. 
Let it pafs through it's Poles, and it is done. 
Of which there will be four Cafes : . . ,. mf 

1. To draw a Circle perpendicular to the Primitive, which is done by any (trait Line paf- 
fing through the Center. . . . , 

2. To draw a Circle perpendicular to a right Circle, is only to draw a Diameter at right 

Angles with that right Circle. r-.^v &lt;-\^r 

3 To draw an oblique Circle perpendicular to a right one 5 only draw a right Circe th-t 

(hall pafs through both the Pole? of fuch a right Circle, ^^ 



Chap. 6 . of the Plain-Scale. 3 7 

Thus the oblique Circle D C R is perpendicular to the right one O O^ becaufe it palTes 
through it's Poles D and R. 

4. To draw an oblique Circle perpendicular to another : Plate 5. 

Firft find F, the Pole of the given oblique Circle C e B, and then draw any-how the Dia- Fig 1. 
meter D R : So a Circle, drawn through the three Points D, P, and R, will be the Circle re- 
quired •, for pafTing through the Poles of the oblique Circle C e B, it muft be perpendicular 
to it. 

U S E V. To meafure the Quantity of the Degrees of any Arc of a great Circle. 

1. If the Arc be part of the Primitive, it is meafured on the Line of Chords. 

2. If the Arc be any part of a right Circle, the Degrees of it are meafured on the Scale 
of Semi-Tangents, fuppofing the Center of the primitive Circle to be in the Beginning of 
the Scale ; fo that if the Degrees are to be reckoned from the Center, you muft account ac- 
cording to the Order of the Scale of Half-Tangents. 

But if the Degrees are to be accounted from the Periphery of the Primitive, as will often 
happen, then you muft begin to account from the End of the Scale of Half-Tangents, calling 
80, 10 -, 70, 20, &amp;c. 

3. To meafure any part of an oblique Circle ; firft find it's Pole, and there laying the 
Ruler, reduce the two Extremities of the Arc required to the primitive Circle, and then 
meafure the Diftance between thofe Points on the Line of Chords. 

Thus, in the laft Figure, if the Quantity of ^B, an Arc of the oblique Circle C e B be Fig. r. 
required, lay a Ruler to P the Pole, and reduce the Points e B to the primitive Circle ; fo 
fhall the Diftance between O and B, meafured on the Line of Chords^ be the Quantity of 
Degrees contained in the Arc e B. 

USE VI. To meafure any Spherical Angle. 

1. If the angular Point be at the Center of the primitive Circle, then the Diftance between 
the L'-gs taken from the Limb, and meafured on the Chords-, is the Quantity of the Angle 
fought. 

2. If the angular Point be at the Periphery, as ACB; here the Poles of both Circles be- Fig 2. 
ing in the fame Diameter, find the Pole of the oblique Circle C B O, which let be P ; then 

the Diftance of B P, meafured on the Scale of Halt-Tangents, is the Meafure of the Angle 
ACB. 

For the Poles of all Circles muft be as far diftant from each other, as are the Angles of the 
Inclinations of their Planes. 

But if the two Poles are not in the fame Diameter, being both found in their proper Dia- 
meter, reduce thofe Points to the primitive Circle ; and then the Diftance between them 
there, accounted on the Line of Chords, is the Quantity of the Angle fought. 

When the angular Point is fomewhere within the primitive Circle, and yet not at the Fig. 3. 
Center, proceed thus : Suppofe the Angle abC be fought; find the Pole P of the Circle 
a b d, and then the Pole of the Circle e b c \ after which lay a Ruler to the angular Pointj 
and the two Poles P and Q, and reduce them to the primitive Circle by the Points x and 2 ; 
So is the Arc x z, meafured on the Line of Chords, the Meafure of the Angle a b C required. 

USE VII. To draw a Parallel Circle. 

t. If it be to be drawn parallel to the primitive Circle, at any given Diftance, draw it 
from the Center of the Primitive, with the Complement of that Diftance taken from the 
Scale of Half-Tangents. 

2. If it be to be drawn parallel to a right Circle ; as fuppofe a b y parallel to A B, was to F - 

be drawn at 23 Deg. 30 Min. Diftance from it •, from the Line of Chords take 23 Deg. 30 ' 8 ' 4 * 
Min. and fet it both-ways on the Limb from A to a, and B to b (or fet it's Complement 66 
Deg. 30 Min. both-ways from P the Pole of A B) to the Points a and b. 

Then take the Tangent of the Parallel's Diftance from the Pole of the right Circle A B, 
which is here 66 Deg. 30 Min. and fetting one foot in a and b&gt; with the other ftrike two 
little Arcs, to interfecT each other fomewhere above P, which will give C, the Center of the 
parallel Circle a b d required. 

3. If it be drawn parallel to an oblique Circle, and at the Diftance fuppofe of 40 Degrees r Fig. 5. 
Firft find P, the Pole of the oblique Circle ABC, and then meafure, on the Scale of 

Half-Tangants, the Diftance £ P, which fuppofe to be 34 Degrees ; then add to it 50 De- 
grees, the Complement of the Circle's Diftance, it will make 84 Degrees ; and alfo fub- 
itracYing 50 from it, or it from 50, it will make 16 Degrees : Then this Sum and Difference 
taken from the Scale of Half-Tangents, and fet each way from P the Pole of the oblique 
Circle, will give the two Extremes a b of the Diameter, or the Points of the Interferon of 
the Parallel •, and then the middle Diftance between a and b, is the Center of the true parallel 
Circle Fab, which is parallel to the given oblique Circle ABC; and at the given Diftance 
of 40 Degrees : or the Half-Tangent of 84, fet from g, will give b ; and the Half-Tangent 
of 16 Degrees, fet alfo from g, and the Points a and b, the two Ends of the parallel Circle's 
Diameter will be had. 

L USE 



38 The Conftruciion and Ufes Book I. 

USE VIII. To meafure any projecled Arc of a parallel Circle. 

1. If it be parallel to the Primitive, then a Ruler, laid through the Center and the Divifion 
of the Limb, will divide the Parallel into the fame Degrees, or determine, in the Limb, the 
Quantity of any Arc parallel to it. 

2. If the Circle be parallel to a right one, as a do is, in cafe the fecond of the laft Ufe&gt; 
and it were required to meafure that Arc a b, or to divide it into proper Degrees : Since 
that parallel Circle is 66 Deg. 30 Min. diftant from P, the nearer Pole of the right Circle 
A B, and confequently 113 Deg. 30 Min. diftant from it's other Pole; take the Half- 
Tangent of 113 Deg. 30 Min. or the Tangent of it's half, 56 Deg. 45 Min. and with that 
Diftance, and on the Center of the Primitive, draw a Circle parallel to the Limb.; and di- 
vide that half of it, which lies towards the oppofite Pole of A B, into it's Degrees: Then a 
Ruler laid from P, and the equal Divifions of that Semicircle, will divide a b, or meafure 
any part thereof. 

3. To meafure or divide the Arc of a Circle which is projected, parallel to an oblique one. 
As fuppofe the Circle a b, which is parallel to the oblique one ABC, pig. Cafe 3. of the 

precedent Ufe, and at the Diftance of 40 Degrees ; this parallel Circle being 40 Degrees 
diftant from the Plane of the Circle ABC, muft be 50 Degrees diftant from it's Pole, and 
confequently 130 Degrees from it's oppofite I'ole : therefore take the Semi-Tangent of 130 
Degrees, or the Tangent of it's half, 65 Degrees, and with that, as a Radius, draw a Circle 
parallel to the Limb of the Primitive, which Circle divide into proper Degrees ; then fLall a 
Ruler laid through P, and the equal Divifion of that Circle, cut the little Circle a b into it's 
proper Degrees, or truly give the Meafure of any part thereof. 

Thefe being molt of the general Ufes of the Scales of Lines commonly put upon Plain- 
Scales, their particular Applications in Navigation, Spherical Trigonometry, and Aftronomy, 
would take up too much room •, therefore I proceed to Outlier's Scale. 

As for it's Ufe in the Projection of the Sphere, fee the UJes of I be Englifh Seffor.

Of the ConJlruEiton and Ufes of GunterV*5W£. 

Fig. 6. ^T*^ H I S Scale is commonly made of Box, and fometimes of Brafs, exactly two Foot 

X long (though there are others but a Foot long, which are not fo exact) about an Inch 
and -I broad, ard of a convenient Thicknefs. 

The Lines that are put on one Side of it are the Line of Numbers, marked on the Scale 
Numbers ; the Line of artificial Sines, marked Sines -, the Line of artificial Tangents, marked 
Tangents-, the Line of artificial verfed Sines, marked V. S. fignifying Verfed Sines ; the ar- 
tificial Sines of the Rhumbs, marked S. R. fignifying the Sines of the Rhumbs ; the artificial 
Tangents of the Rhumbs, marked T. R. fignifying Tangents of the Rhumbs ; the Meridian- 
Line in Mercator's Chart, marked Merid. fignifying Meridian-Line; and equal Parts, marked 
E. P. fignifying equal Parts. 

There are commonly placed on thefe Scales, that are but a Foot long, the Lines of Latitudes, 
Hours, and Inclinations of Meridians. 

On the Back-fide of this Scale are placed all the Lines that are put upon a Plain-Scale. 

The Lines of artificial Sines, Tangents, and Numbers are fo fitted on this Scale, that, by 
means of a Pair of CompaiTes, any Problem, whether in right-lined, or fpherical Trigono- 
metry, may be folved by them very expeditioufly, with tolerable Exactnefs ; and therefore 
the Contrivance of thefe Lines on a Scale is extremely ufeful in all Parts of Mathematicks 
that Trigonometry hath to do with ; as Navigation, Dialling, Aftronomy, &amp;c. 

Conftruciion of the Line of Numbers. 

The Conftruction of the Line of Numbers is thus : Having pitched upon it's Length, 
which, on Gunter's Scale, let be 23 Inches, take exactly half that Length, which will be 
the Length of either of the Radius's ; then take that half Length, and divide into 10 equal 
Parts, one of which diagonally fubdivide into 100 equal Parts, that is, make a Diagonal 
Scale of 1000 equal Parts of the aforefaid Half-Length, which may eafily be done from our 
Author's 8th Ufe. 

Now having drawn, on Gunter's Scale, three Parallels, for better diftinguifhing the Divi- 
fions of the Line of Numbers, and made a Mark for the Beginning of it, half an Inch from 
the Beginning-end of the Scale, look in a Table of Logarithms lor the Number 200, and 
againfl it you will find 2.301030 ; and rejecting the Characteriftick 2, and alfo the three laft 
Figures 030, becaufe the Length of the Radius is divided but into 1000 equal Parrs, take 
301 of thofe 1000 Parts in your Compaffes, and lay off that Diftance from the Beginning of

the Line, at the End of which write 2 for the firft Prime; Again, to find the Divifion.for 
the fecond Prime, look, in the Table of Logarithms for the Number 300, and againft it yoii 
will find 2.477121 ; and rejecting the Characteriftick 2, and the three laft Figures 121, as be- 
fore, take 477 from your Diagonal Scale, and lay off that Diftance from 1 at the Beginning, at 
the End of which write 3 for the fccond Prime. In this manner proceed for all the Primes of 
the firft Radius to r, which will be the whole Length of your Diagonal Scale, or 1000 equal 
Parts. And becaufe each of the Primes of the fecond Radius are at the fame Diftance from 1, 
at the End of the firft Radius, as the fame Primes, on the firft Radius, are diftant from 1 at 
the Beginning, the Primes on the fecond Radius are eafily found. 

The Divifions of the Tenths, between each of the Primes in both Radius's, are found 
thus : Look in the Table of Logarithms for 1 10, and againft it you will find 2.041393, and 
rejecting the Characteriftick 2, and the three laft Figures, there will remain 41 •, which 
taken from the aforefaid Diagonal Scale of 1000, will give the firft Tenth in the firft Prime. 
Again, look in the Table for 120, and againft it you will find 2.07918 1 ; and by rejecting 
the Characteriftick, and the three laft Figures, there will remain 79; which taken from the 
Diagonal Scale, will give the fecond Tenth in the firft Prime. Proceed thus for .all the 
Tenths in the firft Primes of both Radius's. And to find the Tenths in the fecond Primes 
of both Radius's, look in the Table for the Number 21c, and againft it you will find 
2.322219, whence rejecting as before, you will have 322, which laid off from the Beginning 
of the firft Prime, will give the firft Tenth in the fecond Prime. Again, to find the fecond 
Tenth in the fecond Prime, look for the Number 220, and againft it you will find 2.342423, 
•whence by rejecting, as before, you will have 342 for the fecond Tenth, in the fecond Prime. 
In like manner may the Tenths in all the Primes of both Radius's be found. 

To find every two Centefms in the firft Prime of the fecond Radius, look for the Number 
102 in the Table of Logarithms, and againft it you will find 2.008600, and by rejecting, as 
in the Table of Logarithms, and againft it you will find 2.008600, and by rejecting, as at 
firft, you will have 8 for the fecond Centefm. Again, look in the Table for 104, and pro- 
ceed as before, and you will have 17 for the third Centefm. In like manner you may have 
every fecond Centefm in the firft, and alfo the Second Primes of the fecond Radius. 

Note, In bifecting every of the two Centefms in the firft Prime, Centefms will be had. 
Note alfo, That the third, fourth, and fifth Primes, cannot be divided into every two Cen- 
tefms, but only into every five, becaufe of the Smallnefs of the Divifions. 

Conjtruclicn of the Line of artificial Sines and Tangents. 

The Line of artificial Sines on Gunter's Scale, is nothing but the Logarithms of the natural 
Sines, translated from the Tables of artificial Sines and Tangents, almoft in the fame Manner 
as the Logarithms of the natural Numbers were ; the Method of doing which is thus : 

Having drawn three Parallels under the Line of Numbers for diftinguifhing the Divifions 
of the Line, and marked a Point exactly half an Inch from the Beginning-end of the Scale, 
reprefenting the Beginning of the Li.ie of Sines, look in the Tables of artificial Sines and 
Tangents, for the Sine of 40 Minutes, which is the firft Subdivision of the Line, and it will 
be found 8.065 776 : then rejecting the Characteriftick 8, and the three 1 laft Figures 776, as 
in the Conftiuclion of the Line of Numbers, the 65 remaining, muft be taken on the fame 
Scale of 1000 Parts, as ferved before for the Line of Numbers •, this 65 laid off from the 
Beginning of the Line of Sines, will give the Divifion on the Line of Sines for 40 Mii%ites. 
Again, To make the next Divifion, which is for 50 Minutes, feek in the Table for the Sine 
of 50 Minutes, which will be found 8.1 62681 ; then rejecting the Characteriftick 8, and the 
three laft 1 igures 681, take the Remainder 162, from your Scale of 1000 Parts, and lay it 
off from the Beginning of the Line, and that will give the Divifion for 50 Minutes. More- 
over, to make the Divifion for 1 Degree, feek the Sine of 1 Degree, which is 8.241855, and 
rejecting as before, take the Remainder 241 from the Scale of 1000, and lay it off from the 
Beginning on the Line of Sines, which will give the Divifion for 1 Degree. Proceed thus for 
the other Degrees and Minutes to 90 •, only take notice, that when you come to 5 Degrees, 
50 Minutes, the Parts to be taken off the Scale are more than 1000, and, confequently, 
longer than the Scale itfelf. In that Cafe you muft make a Mark in the Middle of the Line 
of Sines ; from which lay off all the Parts found above 1000, for the Degrees and Minutes : 
As, to make the Divifion for 6 Degrees, the Sine of which is 9.019235, the Parts to be taken 
off the Scale will be 1019 •, therefore lay off 19 from the middle Point, reprefenting 1000, 
and the Divifion for 6 Degrees will be had. Proceed in the fame manner for the Line of 
artificial Tangents, 'till you come to 45 Degrees^whofe Length is equal to Radius ; and the 
Divifions for the Degrees and Minutes above 45, which fnould go beyond 45, are fet down 
by their Complements to 90. For Example, the Divifion of 40 Degrees hath it's Complement 
50 fet to it, becaufe the proper equal Parts taken off the Scale of 1000 to make the Divifion, 
for the Tangent of 50 Deg. will be as much above 1000 (which are the equal Parts for the 
Tangent of 45 Degrees, to be laid off from the middle of the Line of Tangents) as the 
equal Parts for the Divifion of the Tangent of 40 Degrees wants of 1000 •, an Example of 
which will make it manifeft: The Tangent of 40 Degrees is 9.924813, and by rejecting the 
Characteriftick, and the three laft Figures, the Parts of 1000, viz. 924 taken from 1000, and 
there remains 76, which are the Parts that the Tangent of 40 Degrees is diftant from the 

Tangent 



aq *The Conftruffion and Ufes Book I. 

Tangent of 45 Degrees. Again, the Tangent of 50 Degrees is 10.076186, and by re- 
jecting the Characteriftick, and the three lalt Figures, the Parts j6 above 1000, for the Di- 
vifion of the Tangent of 50 Degrees, which muft fall beyond 45 Degrees, are equal to the 
Parts that theDivifion of 40 Degrees wants of 1000. Underftand the fame for the Tangent 
of any other Degree, or Minute, and it's Complement : the Reafon of this is, becauie Radius 
is a mean Proportional between any Tangent and it's Complement. 

The Conftruction of the artificial Sines of the Rhumbs, and quarter Rhumbs, is deduced 
from a Confideration that the firft Rhumb makes an Angle of 11 Deg. 15 Min. with the 
Meridian ; the fecond, 22 Deg. 30 Min. the third, 33 Deg. 45 Min the fourth, 45 Deg. csV. 
therefore to make the Divifion on Gunter's Scale, for the firft Rhumb, take the Extent of 
the artificial Sine of 1 1 Deg. 15 Min. on the Scale, and lay it off upon the Line drawn to 
contain the Divifions of the Line of Rhumbs, and that will give the Divifion for the firft 
Rhumb. Again; take the Extent, ontheLineofartificialSir.es, of the Sine of 22.30 Min. 
and lay it off in the fame manner as before, and you will have the fecond Rhumb : proceed 
thus for all the other Rhumbs. The Divifions for the half Rhumbs, and quarter Rhumbs, 
are alfo made in the fame manner : the Divifions of the artificial Tangents of the Rhumbs, 
are made in the fame manner as the Divifions of the artificial Sines of the Rhumbs, by taking 
the artificial Tangents of the feveral Angles that the Rhumbs and quarter Rhumbs make with 
the Meridian. 

The ConJlruHion of the Line of artificial verfed Sines. 

This Line, which begins at about 1 1 Deg. 45 Min. and runs to 180 Deg which is exactly 
under 90 of the Line of Sines (though on the Scale they are numbered backwards ; that is, to 
the verfed Sine of each 10 Degrees above 20, are fet the Numbers of their Complements to 
182, for a Reafon hereafter fhewn), may be thus made, by means of the Table of Sines, and 
the aforefaid equal Parts. Suppofe the Divifion for the verfed Sine of 15 Degrees be to be 
made. Take half 15 Degrees, which will be 7'. 30" 1 ; the Sine of which doubled will be 
18.231396, and by fubftracting the Radius therefrom, you will have 8.231396-, and rejec- 
ting the three laft Figures, and the Characteriftick, there will remain 231 ; this 231 taken 
from your Scale of 1000, and laid off from a Point directly under the Beginning of the Line 
of Sines, will give the Divifion for the verfed Sine of 15 Degrees, at which is fet 165, viz. 
the Complement of 15* to i8o d . Again; to make the Divifion for 20 Degrees; twice the 
Sine of 10 Degrees (it's half) will be 18.470340 ; from which, fubftracting Radius, and re- 
jecting the Characteriftick, and the three laft Figures, you will have 479 ; which taken from 
your Scale, and laid off from the Beginning of the Line, will give the Divifion for the verfed 
Sine of 20 Degrees. And in this manner may the Line of verfed Sines be divided to 180 
Degrees, by obferving what I have faid in the Conftruction of the Line of Sines. 

The Manner of projecting the L ines of Numbers, artificial Sines and Tangents., in Circles^ 

and Spirals of any Number of Revolutions. 

Fig. 7. Suppofe the Circle BC is to be divided into a Line of Numbers of but one Radius; firft, 

divide the Limb into 1000 equal Parts, beginning from the Point G; then take 301 of thofe 
Parts, which fuppofe to be at p, and lay a Ruler from the Center A, on the faid Point p y 
and that will cut the Periphery of the Circle B C in the Point for the Log. of 2. Again, 
Take 477 Parts upon the Limb, and a Ruler laid from the Center upon the laid Divifion, will 
cut the Circle BC in the Point for the Log. of the Number 3 : and thus by taking the proper 
Parts upon the Limb, from the Point G, which were before directed to be ufed in dividing 
this Line upon the Scale ; and laying a Ruler from the Center, may the Line of Numbers be 
projected upon the Circle BC. And in the fame manner may the Lines of artificial Sines and 
Tangents be projected, from the Sine of 5 H 45'", and Tangent of 5* 42" 1 , to the Sine of 90 1 , 
and the Tangent of 45', by taking (as before directed in the Conftruction of the ftraight 
Lines of Sines and Tangents) the Parts of 1000 for the Degrees and Minutes, and laying 
them off upon the Limb from the Point G, and then laying a Ruler from the Center, which 
will divide the Circles into Lines of Sines and Tangents. 

ti% t. Now to project a Line of Numbers upon the Spiral of Fig. 8. having four Revolutions, or 

Turns; firft, divide the Limb into 1000 equal Parts, beginning from thePoint G ; then take 
301, which is the Log. of the Number 2 (when the Characteriftick, and the three laft Figures 
are rejected), and multiply it by 4, becaufe the Spiral hath four Revolutions, and the Product 
is 1204: then if 204 of the Parts of 1000, be taken upon the Limb from G top, and a Ru- 
ler be laid from the Center A to p, it will cut the fecond Revolution of the Spiral in the 
Point for the Number 2. Again ; having multiplied 477, the Log. of the Number 3, by 4, 
the Product will be 1908; whence taking 908 Parts from the Point G on the Limb, to 
the Point q&gt; lay a Ruler from A to j, and that will cut the fecond Revolution of the Spiral, 
in the Point for the Number 3. Moreover, multiply 602 by 4, and the Product will be 
2408 ; whence take 408 Parts upon the Limb from G, and laying a Ruler from A, it will 
cut the third Revolution of the Spiral in the Point, for the Number 4 : and in thus proceed- 
ing may the Spiral be divided into a Line of Numbers, whole Beginning is at the Point C, and 

end 



Chap. 7. ofGxmtzr's-Scale* 41 

End at the Point B. This being underftood, it will be no difficult Matter to project the Sines 
and Tangents in a Spiral of any Number oi Revolutions. 

In ufino- either the Circular or Spiral Lines of Numbers, Sines, and Tangents, there is 
an opening Index placed in the Center A, confiding of two Arms; the one called the ante- 
cedent Arm, and the other the confequent Arm ; then three Numbers, Sines, or Tangents 
beino- given, to find a fourth. If you move the antecedent Arm to the firft, and open the 
othe'r Arm to the fecond (the two Arms keeping the fame Opening), and afterwards the an- 
tecedent Arm be moved to the third, the confequent Arm will fall upon the fourth re- 
quired. 

But, Note, That as many Revolutions of the Spiral as the fecond Term is diftant from the 
firft, fo many Revolutions will the fourth Term be diftant from the third. 

Of the Meridian Line 

The Meridian Line, on Gunter's Scale, is nothing but the Table of Meridional Parts in 
Mercator's Projection transferred on a Line, which may be done in the following Manner, 
by help of the Line of equal Parts fet under it, and a Table of Meridional Parts. 

Take any one of the large Divifions of the aforefaid Line of equal Parts, whofe Length Fig. 9, 
let be AB, and divide it into fix equal Parts upon fome Plane ; at the Points A B raife the 
Perpendiculars A C, BD, equal to AB, and compleat the Parallelogram A B D C ; divide 
the Sides AC, BD, into ten equal Parts, and the Side DC into fix, draw the Diagonals 
AF, 10, 20, C5V. as per Figure, and you will have a Diagonal Scale, by which any part of 
the aforefaid Divifion under 60 may readily be taken. 

Now to make the Divifions of the Meridian Line, look in the Table of meridional Parts 
for 1 Degree, and againft it you will find 60 : and rejecting the laft Figure, which in this 
Cafe is o, take fix equal Parts from the aforementioned Diagonal Scale, and lay it off on the 
Meridian Line, which will give the Divifion for one Degree. Again, to find the Divifion 
for 2 Degrees, feek in the Table of Meridional Parts, for the Parts againft 2 Degrees, and 
they will be found 120: whence rejecting the laft Figure (which always muft be done), 
take 12 from your Scale, and lay it off from the Beginning of the Meridian Line, and the 
Divifion for 2 Degrees will be had. Moreover, to find the Divifion for 1 1 Degrees, you 
will find anfwering to it 664 ; and rejecting the laft Figure, the Remainder will be 66, which 
muft be laid off from the Beginning of the Meridian Line to have the Divifion for 1 1 De- 
grees. But becaufe 66 cannot be taken from the Diagonal Scale, you muft take only 6 from it ; 
and for the 60, take it's whole Length, or elfe lay off the 6 from the End of the firft Divifion 
of the Line of equal Parts, and the Divifion for 1 1 Degrees will be had. In this manner 
may the Meridian Line be divided into Degrees, and every thirty Minutes, as it is upon 
the Scale. 

There are feveral other ways of dividing this Meridian Line, but let this fuffke. 

The Ufe of this Line is to project a Mercator's Chart. 

ProjeEIion of the Line of Latitudes and Hours. 

Upon the End A, of the Diameter of the Circle, erect a Line of Sines at right Angles, of Fig. 10. 
the Length of the Diameter ; then from the Point B, the other End of the Diameter, draw 
right Lines to each Degree of that Line of Sines, cutting the Quadrant A C. Now having 
drawn the Chord-Line A C, which is to be the Line of Latitudes, fet one Foot of your Com- 
paffes upon the Point A, and with the other transfer the Interfections made by the Lines 
drawn from B, on the Quadrant, to the Chord-Line A C, by means of which it will be di- 
vided into a Line of Latitudes. Or the Line of Latitudes may be made by this Canon, viz. 
As Radius is to the Chord of 90 Deg. So is the Tangent of any Degree, to another Tangent, 
the natural Sine of whofe Arc, taken from a Diagonal Scale of equal Parts, will give the Di- 
vifion, for that Degree, on the Line of Latitudes, and fo for any other Degree. 

Again, To graduate the Line of Hours, draw the Tangent G H equal to the Diameter 
AB, and parallel thereto ; then divide each of the Arcs of half the Quadrants A K, KB, 
into three Parts, for the Degrees of every Hour from 12 to 6, which muft again be each 
fubdivided into Halfs, Quarters, &amp;c. then, if thro' each of the aforefaid Divifions and Sub- 
divifions, Lines be drawn from the Center, cutting the Tangent Line G H, they will divide 
the faid Line into a Line of Hours. 

As for the Line of Inclination of Meridians, ufually put upon Scales, it is nothing but 
the Line of Hours numbered with Degrees inftead of Time; and the Lines of the Style's 
Height, and Angle of 12 and 6, fometimes put upon Scales, are made from Tables of the 
btyle s Height, &amp;c. and no otherwife ufed. 

Whence the Line of Hours is but two Lines of natural Tangents to 45 Degrees, each fet 
together at the Center, and from thence Beginning and continued to each End of the Dia- 
meter, and from one End thereof, numbered with 90 Deg. to the other End ; and may other- 
wife be thus divided : Let A B be the Radius of a Line of Tangents, C D another Radius Fig. it; 
equal and parallel thereto, and C B the Diameter to either of the faid Radius's, which is 
to be divided into a Line of Hours. Now if right Lines are drawn from the Point D, to 
every Degree of the Tangent-Line A B, thofe Lines will divide G B, half of the Line of 

M Hours, 



42 Tthe ConjlruSlion and Ufes Book I. 

Hours, as required \ and Lines drawn from the Point A, to every Degree of the Tangent 
C D, will divide the other half of C B : therefore from the fimilar Triangles C DF, EFB, 
it will be as the Radius CD is to the Tangent EB of any Arc under 45: So is CF to F B 3 
that is, As Radius is to the Tangent of any Arc under ^5 Degrees, So is Radius j- theCo- 
Fi_. 12, tangent of the faid Arc to 45 Degrees, to Radius — the faid Cotangent, as in Fig. 12. As 

the Radius A B, to the Tangent BC of any Arc, So is AB-j-EG, to AB — EG: for call 
A B, r ; and B C, b ; and from th e Point C, draw C F parallel to EG, and make BD

Thus having given the Conftrtiction of the Lines on Gunter's Scale, I now proceed to 
fhew their manner of ufing ; but, Note, Thefe Lines are alfo put upon Rulers to flide by 
each other, and are therefore called Sliding-Gunters, fo that you may ufe them without Com- 
pafTes ; but any Perfon that understands how to ufe them with CompafTes, may alfo, by what 
I have faid of Everard's and Coggefhall's Sliding-Rules, ufe them without. 

USE of the Li?ies of Numbers, Sines, and Tangents. 

USE I. The Bafe of a right-angled right-lined Triangle being given 30 Miles, and the 
oppofite Angle to it 26 Degrees, to find the Length of the Hypothenufe. 

As the Sine of the Angle, 26 Degrees, is to the Bafe, 30 Miles, So is Radius to the 
Length of the Hypothenufe. Set one Foot of your Com partes upon the 26th Degree of the 
Line of Sines, and extend the other to 30 on the Line of Numbers ; the CompafTes remain- 
ing thus opened, fet one Foot on 90 Degrees, or the End of the Line of Sines, and caufe 
the other to fall on the Line of Numbers, which will give 68 Miles and about a half, for 
the Length of the Hypothenufe fought. 

USE II. 'The Bafe of a right-angled Triangle being given 25 Miles, and the Perpendi- 
cular 1 5, to find the jingle oppofite to the Perpendicular. 

As the Bafe 25 Miles is to the Perpendicular 15 Miles, So is Radius to the Tangent of 
the Angle fought ; becaufe if the Bafe is made Radius, the Perpendicular will be the Tan- 
gent of the Angle oppofite to the Perpendicular. Extend your CompafTes on the Line of 
Numbers, from 15, the Perpendicular given, to 25, the Bafe given, and the fame Extent 
will reach the contrary way, on the Line of Tangents, from 45 Degrees, to 31 Degrees, the 
Angle lought. 

USE III. The Bafe of a right-angled Triangle being given, fitppofe 20 Miles, and the 
Angle oppofite to the Perpendicular 50 Degrees, to find the Perpendicular. 

As Radius is to the Tangent of the given Angle 50 Degrees, So is the Bafe 20 Miles to 
the Perpendicular fought. Extend your CompafTes on the Line of Tangents, from the Tan- 
gent of 45 Degrees, to the Tangent of 50 Degrees, and the fame Extent will reach on the 
Line of Numbers the contrary way, from the given Bafe 20 Miles, to the required Perpen- 
dicular, about 23 i Miles. 

Note, The Reafon why the Extent on the Line of Numbers was taken from 20 to 23 ~ for- 
wards, is, becaufe the Tangent of 50 Degrees (as I have already mentioned in the Conftruc- 
tion of the Line of Tangents) fhould be as far beyond the Tangent of 45 Degrees, as it's 
Complement 40 Degrees wants of 45 Degrees. 

USE IV. The Bafe of a right-angled Triangle being given, fuppofe 25 Miles, and the 
Perpendicular 48 Miles; to find the Angle oppofite to the Perpendicular. 

As the Bafe 35 Miles is to the Perpendicular 48 Miles, So is Radius to the Tangent of the 
Angle fought. Extend your CompafTes from 35, on the Line of Numbers, 1048 •, the fame 
Extent will reach the contrary way on the Line of Tangents, from the Tangent of 45 De- 
grees, to the Tangent of 36 Degrees 5 Minutes, or $?, Degrees §5 Minutes; and to know 
which of thofe Angles the Angle fought is equal to, confider that the Perpendicular of the 
Triangle is greater than the Bafe j therefore (becaufe both the Angles oppofite to the Per- 
pendicular and Bafe together make 90 Degrees) the Angle oppofite to the Perpendicular will 
be greater than the Angle oppofite to the Bafe, and confequently the Angle $-$ Degrees 5$ 
Minutes, will be the Angle fought.

USE V. The Hypcthcnufe of a right-angled Spherical Triangle being given, fuppofe 60 
Degrees, and one of the Sides 20 Degrees ; to find the Angle oppofite to that Side. 

As the Sine of the Hypothenufe 60 Degrees is to Radius, So is the Sine of the given Side 
20 Degrees, to the Sine of the Angle fought. Extend your Compaffes, on the Line of Sines, 
from 60 Degrees to Radius, or 90 Degrees, and the fame Extent will reach on the Line of 
Sines the fame way, from 20 Degrees, the given Side, to 1% Degrees 10 Minutes, theQuan- 
tity of the Angle fought. 

USE VI. The Courfe and Dijlance of a Ship given ; to find the Difference of Latitude 

and Departure. 

Suppofe a Ship fails from the Latitude of 50 Deg. 10 Min. North, S. S. W. 48.5 Miles ! 
As Radius is to the Diftance failed 48.5 Miles, So is the Sine of the Courfe, which is two 
Points, or the fecond Rhumb, from the Meridian, to the Departure. Extend your Compaf- 
fts from S, on the artificial Sine Rhumb-Line, to 48.5 on the Line of Numbers ; the fame 
Extent will reach the fame way from the fecond Rhumb, on the Line of artificial Sines of 
the Rhumbs, to the Departure Wefting 18.6 Miles. Again, as Radius is to the Diftance 
failed 48-5 Miles, So is the Co-Sine of the Courfe 67 Deg. 30 Min. to the Difference of La- 
titude. Extend your Compares from Radius, on the Line of Sines, to 48.5 Miles on the 
Line of Numbers ; the fame Extent will reach the fame way, from 67 Deg. 30 Min. on the 
Line of Sines, to 44.8 on the Line of Numbers; which converted into Degrees, by allowing 
60 Miles to a Degree, and fubftra&amp;ed from the given North-Latitude 50 Deg. 10 Min. leaved 
the Remainder 49 Deg. 25 Min. the prefent Latitude. 

USE VII. The Difference of Latitude and Departure from the Meridian being given ; to 

find the Courfe and Dijlance. 

A Ship, from the Latitude of 59 Deg. North, fails North-Eaftward 'till me has altered 
her Latitude 1 Deg. 10 Min. or 70 Miles, and is departed from the Meridian $7.5 Miles; 
to find the Courfe and Diftance. 

As the Difference of Latitude 70 Miles is to Radius, So is the Departure 57.5 Miles to 
the Tangent of the Courfe 39 Deg. 20 Min. or three Points and a half from the Meridian. 
Extend your Compaffes from the fourth Rhumb, on the Line of artificial Tangents of the 
Rhumbs, to 70 Miles on the Line of Numbers : the fame Extent will reach from 57.5 on 
the Line of Numbers, to the third Rhumb and a half on the Line of artificial Tangents of 
the Rhumbs. Again ; As the Sine of the Courfe 39 Deg. 20 Min. is to the Departure 57.5 
Miles, So is Radius to the Diftance 90.6 Miles. Extend your Compaffes from the third 
Rhumb and a half, on the artificial Sines of the Rhumbs,, to 5J.5 Miles on the Line of 
Numbers, and that Extent will reach from the Sine of the eighth Rhumb, on the Sines of 
the Rhumbs, to 90.6 Miles on the Line of Numbers. 

USE of the Line of Verfed Sines. 

The three Sides of an oblique Spherical Triangle being given, to find the Angle oppofite to 

the great eft Side. 

Suppofe the Side A B be 40 Degrees, the Side B C 60 Degrees, and the Side AC 06 De- F i* 1* 
grees, to hnd the Angle A B C. Firft add the three Sides together, and from half the Sum 
iubftraa the greater Side AC, and note the Remainder; the Sum will be 196 Degrees, 
half of which is 98 Degrees ; from which fubftracling 96 Degrees, the Remainder will be 
two Degrees. 

This done, extend your Compaffes from the Sine of 90 Degrees, to the Sine of the Side 
A B 40 'Degrees ; 2nd applying this Extent to the Sine of the other Side B C 60 Degrees 
you will find it to reach to a fourth Sine about 34 Degrees. Again j from this fourth Sine 
extend your Compaffes to the Sine of half the Sum, that is, to the Sine of 72 Degrees, the 
Complement of 9 8 Degrees to 180, and this fecond Extent will reach from the Sine of the 
Difference 2 Degrees to the Sine of 3 Deg. 24 Min. againft which, on the Verfed Sines, 
itands 151 Deg. 5 o Mm. which is the Quantity of the Angle fought. 

That the Reafon of this Operation may appear, it is demonftrated in moft Books of Tri- 
gonometry, that As Radius is to the Sine of A B, So is the Sine of B C to a fourth Sine ; 
a r r r u ' V° Radius ' So is the Difference of the verfed Sines of A C and 

• irTi ^ ed S,ne of the Complement of the Angle A B C to 180 Degrees. It 

is alfo demonftrated, that As Radius is to the Sine of half the Sum of any two Arcs, So is the 
bme of half their D.fterence to half the Difference of the verfed Sines of thefe two Arcs 
•whence, if the Sine of A B be called a y the Sine of B C, b, and the Sine of A C, c, the 

fourth Sine in the firft Analogy will be had ; in faying, as r : a : : b : — . Now to get the 

Difference of verfed Sines of A C, and A B -J- BC, let us call the Sine of AB i " BC ~^ AC /&gt;, 

and

and the Sine of '■ — -— q, then as r :p : : q : r \ which laft Term will be half the 

Difference of the verfed Sines of A C, and A B - 1- £ C : therefore, if we again fay, as

Angle ABC: To find which at two Operations, you mini fay, As r : a : : b : — ; then as 

— 'P-'-q'- —z i which laft Term, multiplied by 2, will be the verfed Sine Complement 

fought. But, to avoid multiplying by 2, the verfed Sines on Scales are fitted from this Pro- 
portion, viz. As Radius is to half the Sine of an Arc, So is half the Sine of the fame Arc, 
to half the verfed Sine of that Arc. 

U S E of the Line of Latitudes and Hours. 

Thefe Lines are conjointly ufed, in readily pricking down the Hour- Lines from the Sub- 
ftyle, in an Ifofceles Triangle, on any kind of upright Dials, having Centers in any given 
Latitude; that is, by means of them there will be this Proportion worked, viz. As Radius 
is to the Sine of the Style's Height, So is the Tangent of the Angle at the Pole, to the Tan- 
gent of the Hour-Lines Diftance from the Subftyle. 

Now fuppofe the Hour-Lines are to be pricked down upon an upright Declining-Plane, 
declining 25 Deg. Eaftwards : Firft draw C 12 the Meridian, perpendicular to the Horizon- 
Fig. 14. tal Line of the Plane, and make the Angle FC 12 equal to the Subflyle's Diftance from the 
Meridian, and draw the Line F C for the Subflyle. This being done, draw the Line B A 
perpendicular to the faid Subftyle, paffing thro' the Center C ; then out of your Line of 
Latitudes fet off C A, C B, each equal to the Style's Height, and fit in the Hour-Scale, 
fo that one End being at A, the other may meet with the Subftyle Line at F. 

Now get the Difference between 30 Deg. 47 Min. the Inclination of Meridians, and 30 
Degrees, the next Hour's Diftance letter than the faid 30 Deg. 47 Min. and the Difference is 
47 Minutes, that is, 3 Minutes in time ; then count upon the Line of Hours, 

Hours. Min. 

And make Points at the Ter- 
minations, to which draw- 
from F to ^ ** ing Lines from the Center 
C, they fhall be the Hour- 
Lines on one Side. 

Again, fitting in the Hour-Scale from B to F, count from that End at B, the former Arcs 
of Time. 




Hours. Min.

And make Points at the Ter- 
minations, thro' which draw 
from R to I ^ Lines from the Center C, and 
they will be the Hour-Lines 
on the other Side the Sub- 
ftyle. 



You muft proceed thus for the Halfs and Quarters, in getting the Difference between the 
Half-Hour next leffer (in this Example 22 Deg. 30 Min.) under the Arc of Inclination of 
Meridians; the Difference is 1 Deg. 17 Min. which in time is 33 Minutes, to be continu- 
ally augmented an Hour at a Time, and fo be pricked off, as before was done for the whole 
Hours. 

If the Hour-Scale reach above the Plane, as at B, fo that B C cannot be pricked down ; 
then may an Angle be made on the upper Side of the Subftyle, equal to the Angle F C A 
on the under Side, and thereby the Hour-Scale laid in it's due Pofition, having firft found 
the Point F on the Subftyle. 

That the Reafon of the conjoint Ufe of thefe Lines, in pricking off the Hour-Lines from 
the Subftylar-Line may appear ; let us fuppofe A C to be the Subftylar-Line, A the Center 
Fig. 15. of a Dial, B A a Portion of the Line of Latitudes, at right Angles to A C, and B C the 

Line of Hours fitted thereto. Now if C D be the Quantity of any Arc taken on the Line of 
Hours, and a right Line be drawn from the Center A through the Point D, the Angle F AC 
will be the fame, as that found by faying, As Radius is to the Sine of the Number of 
Degrees pricked off upon the Line of Latitudes (that is, to the Sine of the Style's Height), 
From A to B; So is the Tangent of that Number of Degrees pricked off from C to D on 
the Line of Hours (that is, the Tangent of the Angle at the Pole), to another Tangent, 

whofe

•whofe Arc will be equal to F A C (that is, to the Tangent of the Diftance of the Hour-Line 
A F from the Subftyle). 

Now ro prove this, it is evident, from the Conftruction of the Line of Latitudes, that as 
the Ridius B C is to the Sine B G of an Arc ; So is A C to AB : whence if AC be fuppofed 
Radius, B A is the Sine of the Arc pricked down from the Line of Latitudes. 

Again, from the Nature of the Line of Hours ; if CD be taken for the Tangent of am 
Arc, B D will be the Radius thereto. This being evident, let C E be the Tangent of the 
Angle F A C, then the Triangles BAD, DEC, will be fimilar ; whence as the Radius 
B 1 j is to B A, the Sine of an Arc ; fo is C D, the Tangent of an Arc, to E C, the Tangent 
of the Angle FA C.

H E Sector is a Mathematical Inftru merit, whofe Ufe is to find the Pro- 
portion between Quantities of the fame kind ; as between one Line and 
another, between one Superficies and another, between one Solid and an- 
other, &amp;c. 

This Inftrument is made of two equal Rules, or Legs, of Silver, Brafs, 
Ivory, or Wood, joined to each other by a Rivet, fo worked, as to render 
it's Motion regular and uniform. To do which, firft make two Slits with 
a Saw, about an Inch deep, at one End of one of the Rules, in order to 
fit therein the Head-Pieces, which muff, be well rivetted. Afterwards the Head mufb be 
rounded, by filing off the Superfluities, in fuch manner, that the Middle- Piece and Head- 
Pieces may be even with each other. Then to find the Center of the Rivet, fct one Foot of 
your CompafTes at the Bottom of the Middle-Piece, and mark with the other Foot four Sec- 
tions in the middle of the Rivet, by opening the Middle-Piece of the Joint to four or more 
different Angles, and the Middle- Point of thofe Sections will be the Center of the Rivet, 
and, confequently, alfo the Center of the Sector. This being done, a Line mud be drawn up- 
on the Rule from the Center, near the inward Edge, by which Line the inward Edge of the 
Rule muff be filed ft rait ; the inward Edge of the other Rule being alfo made ftrait, and 
flit, to receive the Middle- Piece, you mult cut away it's Corner in an Arc, fo as it may 
well fit the Joint, and then rivet, with three or four little Rivets, the Rule to the Middle- 
Piece ; by which means the two Legs may eafily open and fhut, and keep at any Opening 
required. But Care muft be taken that the Legs are filed very fiat, and do not twift ; Care 
muft alfo be taken that the Sector be well centered, that is, that being entirely opened, both 
Infide and Outfide, may make a right Line, and that the Legs be very equal in Length and 
Breadth •, in a word, that it be very ftrait every way. Note* The Length and Breadth of 
the aforefaid Rules are not determinate, but they are commonly fix Inches long, three quar- 
ters of an Inch broad, and about one quarter in Thicknefs. 

There are commonly drawn upon the Faces of this Inftrument fix kind of Lines ; viz. tho 
Line of equal Parts, the Line of Planes, and the Line of Polygons on one Side ; the Line of 
Chords, the Line of Solids, and the Line of Metals on the other. 

There is generally placed, near the Edge of the Sector, on one Side, a divided Line, 
whofe Ufe is to find the Bores of Cannons •, and on the other Side, a Line fhewing the Dia- 
meters and Weights of Iron-Bullets, from one Quarter to 64 Pounds, whofe Conftruction 
and Ufes we fhall give, in fpeaking of the Inftru ments belonging to the Artillery.

Chap, i . of the Se&amp;or. 47 

SECTION I. 

Of the Line of Equal Parts. 

THIS Line is fo called, becaufe it is divided into equal Parts, whofe Number is com- Plate 6. 
monly 200, when the Sector is fix Inches long. Fig , 

1 kvino- drawn upon one of the Faces of each Leg the equal Lines A B, A B, from the Cen- 
ter oi the* Joint A: Firft, divide them into two equal Parts, each of which will confequent- 
ly be ioo ; then each of thofe Parts being again divided into two equal Parts, and each Part 
arifincr will' be $o ; then divide each of thefe Jaft Parts into five others, and each Part produced 
wih be io •, and finally dividing each of thefe new Parts into 2, and each of thefe laft into 
five equal Parts, and by this means the Lines A B, AB, will be each disaded into 200 equal 
Parts, every 5 of which mud be diftinguifhed by fhort Strokes, and every 10 numbered 
t'rom'the Center A to 200, at the other End. 

Now becaufe the two other Lines, drawn upon the fame Faces of each Leg, mud ter- 
minate in the Center A, the Extremity B of the Line of equal Parts muft be drawn as near 
as poffible the outward Edges of each Leg, that fo there may be Space enough left to draw 
the Line of Planes in the middle of the Breadth of the faid Legs, and the Line of Polygons 
near their inward Edg»s ; but Care muft be taken, in drawing of thefe Lines, that each 
one, and it's Fellow, be equally diftant from the interior Edges of each Leg, as may be feen 
in the Figure. 

SECTION II. 

Of the Li?ie of Planes. 

THIS Line is fo called, becaufe it contains the homologous Sides of a certain Number 
of fimilar Plants, Multiples of a fmall one, beginning from the Center A ; that is, whofe 
Surfaces are double, triple, quadruple, i£c. that fmall Plane, from Unity, according to the 
natural Order of Numbers, to 64, which is commonly the greateft Term of the Divifions, 
cknoted upon the Line A C. 

This Line may be divided two ways, both of which are founded upon Prop. 20. lib. 6. 
End which dcmonflrates, That fimilar Plane Figures are to each other, as the Squares of 
their homologous Sides. The firft way of dividing this Line is by Numbers, and the fecond 
without Numbers, as follows : 

Having drawn the Line A C, from the Center A, upon each Leg of the Sector ; firft di- 
vide it into eight equal Parts, the firft of which; next to the Center A, which reprefents the 
Side of the leaft Plane, hath no need of being drawn. The fecond Divifion from the Center, 
which is double the firft, is the Side of a fimilar Plane quadruple the leaft Plane, (whofe Side 
is fuppoled one of the eight Parts the Line A C is divided into), becaufe the Square of 2 is 4. 
The third Divifion, which is three times the firft, is the Side of a fimilar Plane, nine times 
greater than the firft, becaufe the Square of 3 is 9. The fourth Divifion, which is four 
times the firft, and confequently half of the whole Scale, is the Side of a fimilar Plane, fix- 
teen times greater than the firft, becaufe the Square of 4 is 16. Laftly, The eighth Divi- 
fion which is eight times the firft, is the Side of a fimilar Plane, fixty-four times greater, 
becaufe the Square of 8 is 64. 

There is fomething more to do to find the homologous Sides of Planes that are double, 
triple, quadruple, &amp;c. of the firft. For you muft have a Scale divided into 1000 equal Parts Fig. 2. 
(as that whofe Conftruction we have already given in Book I.), whofe Length muft be equal 
to the Line A C •, and becaufe the Side of the leaft Plane is '- of the Line A C, it will con- 
fequently be ' of 1000, which is 125. Again, to have in Numbers the Side of a Plane 
double the leaft, the fquare Root of a Number twice the Square of 1 25 muft be found. This 
Square is 15625, which doubled, is 31250, the fquare Root of which is about 177, the Side 
of a fimilar Plane double the leaft, whofe Side is fuppoled to be 125. Moreover, to have the 
Side of a Plane three times the firft, the fquare Root of a Number three times the Square of 
the firft muft be found. The Number is 46875, and it's Root, which is about 216, is the 
Side of a fimilar Plane three times the leaft, and fo of others ; therefore by laying off from 
the Center A, upon the Line of Planes, 177 Parts of the aforefaid Scale, you will have the 
Length of the Side of a fimilar Plane double the leaft Plane. Again, laying off 2 1 6 Parts of 
the lame Scale from the C enter A, the Length of *he Side of a fimilar Plane will be had, 
which is three times the leaft Plane. 

^ According to the aforefaid Directions, the following Table is calculated, that fhews the 
Number of equal Parts which are contained in the homologous Sides of all the fimilar Planes 
that are double, triple, quadruple, &amp;c. of a Plane whofe Side is 125, to the Plane 64, that 
is, which contains it 64 times, and whofe Side is 1000.

Each of the ten Divifions which the Scale of 1000 Parts contains, is 100 ; and each of the 
Subdivifions of the Line AB is 10 : therefore if it is to be ufed for dividing any of the Lines 
of the Sector -&gt; as, for Example, the Line of Planes •, take on the Scale a Line denoting the 
Hundreds, and the Excefs above muft be taken in the Space between the Points- AB : As to 
denote the firft Plane, to which the Number 125 anfwers, place your CompafTes on the fifth 
Line of the Space marked 100, and open them to the Diftance OP; in the fame manner, if 
the Plane 50 is to be denoted, to which the Number 884 anfwers, for 800 take the 8th Space 
of the Scale, and for 84 take in the Space A B, the Interaction of the 8th Tranfvcrfal, with 
the fourth Parallel, which will be the Diftance NL. 

The Line of Planes may otherwife be divided in the following manner, without Calcula- 
tion, founded on Prop 47. lib. 1. Eucl. Make the right-angled Ifofceles Triangle KMN, 
whofe Side KM, or K N, let be equal to the Side of the leaft Plane, and then the Hypo- 
thenufe M N will be the Side of a fimilar Plane double to it ; therefore having laid off with 
your CompafTes the Diftance M N, on the Side KL produced, from K to 2, the Length 
K 2 will be the Side of a Plane double the leaft Plane. In like manner lay off the Diftance 
M 2, from K to 3, the Line K 3 will be the Side of a Plane triple the firft. Again, lay off 
the Diftance M 3, from K to 4, the Line K 4 (twice K M) will be the Side of a Plane four 
times greater, that is, which will contain the leaft Plane four times ; and fo of others, as may 
be feen in the Figure. 

SECTION III. 



Of the Line of Polygons. 



This Line is fo called, becaufe it contains the homologous Sides of the firft twelve regular 
Polygons inlcribed in the fame Circle, that is, from an equilateral Triangle to a Dodecagon. 

The Side of the Triangle being the greateft of all, muft be the whole Length of each of 
the Legs of the Sector ; and becaufe the Sides of the other regular Polygons, inferibed in the 
fame Circle, ftill diminifh as the Number of Sides increafe, the Side of the Dodecagon is 
leaft, and confequently muft be nigheft the Center of the Sector. 

Now fuppofing the Side of a Triangle to be a thoufand Parts, the Length of the Sides of 
every of the other Polygons muft be found ; and becaufe the Sides of regular Polygons, in- 
feribed in the fame Circle, are in the fame Proportion as the Chords of the Angles of the Cen- 
ter of each of the Polygons, it is neceffary to fhew here how to find the faid Angles. 

To do which, divide 360 Deg. by the Number of the Sides of any Polygon, and the 
Quotient will give the Angle of the Center. 

l^ for Example, the Angle of the Center of a Hexagon is required, divide 360 Deg. by 
6, and the Quotient will be 60 ; which fliews that the Angle of the Center of a Hexagon is 
60 Deg. If likewife the Angle of the Center of a Pentagon be required, divide 360 Deg. 
by 5, the Number of Sides, and the Quotient will be 72 •, which fhews that the Angle of the 
Center of a Pentagon is 72 Deg. and fo of others. 

The Angle of the Center being known, if it be fubftracted from 180 Degrees, the Re- 
mainder will be the Angle of the Polygon : As, for Example, the Angle of the Center of a 

Pentagon 



Chap. 



of the Se&amp;or. 



PentB&amp;on being 72 Degrees, the Angle of the Circumference will be io3 Degrees, and fo of 
others^ as may be feen in the following Table.

Now to find in Numbers the Sides of the regular Polygons inferibed in the fame Circfe : 
Having fuppofed that the Side of the equilateral Triangle is 1000 equal Parts, inftead of 
the Chords of the Angles of the Center, take their Halves, which are the Sines of half the 
Angles at their Centers, and make the following Analogy. 

For Example, to find the Side of the Square, fay, As the Sine of 60 Degrees, half the 
Ann-le of the Center of the equilateral Triangle, is to the Side of the fame Triangle, fup- 
pofed 1000 •, So is the Sine of 45 Degrees half the Angle of the Center of the Square, to the 
Side of the fame Square, which, by calculating, will be found 816. 

And in this manner are the following Tables of Polygons conftructed.

To make the Line of Polygons upon the Sector (the fame Scale of 1000 equal Parts be- 
ing ufed, as that for making the Line of Planes), you muft lay ofF from the Center A, upon 
both the Lines A D, the Number of Parts exprefled in the Table, that thereby the Num- 
bers 3, 4, 5, csV. may be graved upon the Sector, fignifying the Numbers of the Sides of the 
regular Polygons.

IV. 



Of the Line of Chords. 

THIS Line is fo named, becaufe it contains the Chords of ail the Degrees of a Semi- 
circle, whofe Diameter is the Length of that Line, which is denoted upon the other Surface 
of each Leg of the Sector, from the Point A, which is the Center of the Joint, to the End F 
of each Leg ; fo that the two Lines A F are exactly equal, and equidiftant from the interior 
Edges of the Sector. 

Note, The Line of Chords mud be drawn directly under the Line of equal Parts, becaufe 
of fome Operations that require a Correfpondence between thofe two Lines. 

It is alio proper for the Line of Solids to be drawn under the Line of Planes, and the 
Line of Metals under the Line of Polygons. 

For the Divifion of the aforefaid Line A F, defcribe a Semicircle, whofe Diameter let be 
equal to it, which divide into 180 Degrees ; afterwards lay off the Lengths of the Chords 
of all thofe Degrees upon the Diameter of the Semicircle ; then lay the Diameter of the Se- 
micircle upon the Legs of the Sector, and mark upon them Points that repreftnt the Degrees 
of the Semicircle, every filth of which, diftinguifh by fhort Strokes, and every tenth by 
Numbers, beginning from the Point A, and going on to F. 

The fame Degrees may otherwife be denoted, upon the Line of Chords, by help of Num- 
bers, in fuppofing the Semidiameter of a Circle, or the Chord of 180 Degrees, to be 1000 
equal Parts •, all of which Numbers may be found ready calculated in the common Tables of 
Sines : for in (lead of the Chords, there is no more to do but to take their halves, which are 
the Sines of half their Arcs. As for Example; inilead ok the Chord of 10 Degrees, the Sine 
of 5 muff, be taken-, and becaufe the Calculation in Tables is made for a Radius of 100000 
Parts, the two laft Numbers muft be taken away, as may be feen in the following Table, 
where the Chords of all the Degrees to 180 are denoted. 

Note, This Divifion is made with a Scale of 1000 Parts.

SECTION V. 

Of the Line of Solids* 

THIS Line is fo called, becaufe it contains the homologous Sides of a certain Number 
of fimilar Solids, Multiples of a leffer from Unity, according to the natural Order of Num- 
bers, to 64, which is commonly the greateft of the Divifions of this Line, which is marked Fig. 44 
A H, next to the Line of Chords. 

To make the Divifions upon it, the Scale of 1000 Parts muft be ufed, and the Side of the 
64th and created Solid mult be fuppofed 1000 equal Parts •, then becaufe the Cube-Root of 
64 is 4, and the Cube Root of 1 is 1, it follows that the Side of the 64th Solid is quadruple 
the Side of the firft and lead Solid, which confequently will be 250, becaufe (per Prop. %%. 
lib. 11. Eucl.) fimilar Solids are to each other, as the Cubes of their homologous Sides. 

The Number 500 (twice 250) is the Side of the eighth Solid, that is, of a Solid eight 
times as great as the firlt : becaufe the Cube of 2, which is 8, is eight times the Cube of 

Unity. p / 

Likewife the Number 750, which is three times 250, is the Side of the 27th Solid ; be- 
caufe the Cube of 3, which is 27, is 27 times the Cube of Unity. 

There are more Calculations required to find the Sides of Solids double, triple, quadru- 
ple, &amp;?f. the firft, which cannot exactly be exprefTed in Numbers, becaufe their Roots are 
incommenfurdble •, ncverthelefs they may be fufficiently approached forUfe, by the following 
Method. 

For Example -, To find the Number expreffing the Side of a Solid, twice the firft and lead i 
it's Side 250 mud be cubed, which is 15625000 ; then this Number muft be doubled, and 
the Cube-Root of it extracted, which will be almoft 315, for the Side of a Solid double the 
firft. To have the Side of a Solid triple the firft, the faid Cube muft be tripled, and it's Cube- 
Root, which is 360, will be the Side of a Solid triple the firft; and fo of others, as may be 
feen in the following Table.

SECTION VI. 

Of the Line of Metals. 

T HI S Line is fo named, becaufe it is ufed to find the Proportion between the fix Me- 
tals, or which Solids may be made. 

It is placed upon the Legs of the Sector, hard by the Line of Solids, and the Metals are Pig, 4, 
hgured thereon by the Chara&amp;ers, which have been appropriated to them by Chymifts and 

T w DiV u ifi ° n ° f thlS Line 1S founded u P on Experiments that have been made of the diffe- 
rent Weights of equal Maffes of each of thefe Metals, from whence their Proportions arc 
calculated, as in the following Table.

A TABLE for the Line of Met ah. Atfoertifment. 

That of all the fix Metals which has the leaf! 
Weight, which is Tin, is marked at the End 
of each Leg (as A G) at a Diftance from the 
Center, equal to the Length of the Scale of 
1000 Parts -, and the other Metals niglier the 
faid Center (each according to the Numbers 
which correfpond with them), taken upon the 
fame Scale. 
Becaufe mod of the aforementioned Lines, marked on the Sector, are divided by means of 
the Scale of 1000 equal Parts, it is requifite that they be exactly equal between themfelves 
and to the faid Scale ; therefore, becaufe they all center in one Point (which is the Center 
of the Joint), they muft all be terminated at the other End by an Arc, made upon the Sur- 
face of each of the Legs. 

It is not always necclTary to divide the Sector by the Methods we have given ; for, to 
make them fooner, prepare a Ruler of the fame Length, Breadth, and Thicknefs as the 
Sector, and draw upon it the fame Lines we have already prefcribed : then with a Beam- 
Compafs transfer the fame Divifions upon the Sector, having firft drawn upon it the Lines vj 
contain them. 

SECTION VII. 

Containing the Proofs of the Six Lines commonly put upon the Sec~fcr. 

The Proof of the Line of equal Parts. 

The Divifion of this Line is fo eafy, that there is no need of any other Proof, but to 
examine, with your CompalTes, whether the two correfpondent Lines, drawn upon the Legs 
of the Sector, are very equal, and equally divided ; which may be known by taking be- 
tween your Compaifts (whofe Points let be very fharp) any Number at pleafure of thofe equal 
Parts, beginning any where : for if the Line of equal Parts be well divided, by carrying that 
fame Opening of your CompaiTes on the faid Line, the two Points will always contain be- 
tween them the fame Number of equal Parts upon either of the Legs, reckoning from the 
Center, or from any other Point of Divifion. 

The Proof of the Line of Chords. 

The Method before explained will not ferve to know whether the Line of Chords be well 
divided, becaufe the Divifions are not equal : the Chord of 10 Degrees, for Example, is 
greater than half that of 20 ; likewife the Chord of 20 Degrees is greater than the hall of 
that of 40 Degrees, and fo on : fo that the Divifions are greater towards the Center of the 
Sector, than towards the Ends of it's Legs, as is manifelt from the Nature of the Circle. 
But becaufe we have given two Methods for dividing the Line of Chords, one by help of 
Numbers, and the other by means of the Chords of Arcs, one of thefe Methods will lerve 
to prove the other. 

But there is ftiil another Method, which is this : Take at pleafure, on the Line of Chords, 
two Numbers equally diftant from 120 Degrees •, as for Example, no and 130, which are 
each 10 Degrees diftant from it; the firft in Defect, and the laft in Excefs : Then take in 
your CompaiTes the Diftance of the two Numbers 1 10 and 130, which muft be equal to the 
Chord of 10 Degrees, or to the Diftance of the Point 10, upon the Line of Chords, from 
the Center of the Sector. 

You will find, by the fame Means, that the Diftance between 100 and 140 Degrees, is 
equal to the Chord of 20 Degrees ; as likewife Che Diftance between 90 and 150 is equal to 
the Chord of 30 Degrees, which is the Number by which 120 exceeds 90, and by which 150 
exceeds 120, and fo of others, as may eafily be noted by the aforegoing Table of Chords, 
where you may fee (for Example) the Number 44, which is the Chord of 5 Degrees, is the 
Difference between 843, which is the Chord of 115 Degrees -, and 887, which is the Chord 
of 125 •, as likewife 87, the Chord of 10 Degrees, is the Difference between the Chord of 1 10 
Degrees and 130, &amp;c. which are equally diftant from 120 Degrees. 

Proof of the Line of Polygons. 

You may know whether this Line be well divided, by help of the Line of Chords, in the 
following manner. 

Take in your CompaiTes, upon the Line of Polygons, the Diftance of the Number 6, de- 
noting a Hexagon, from the Center of the Joint ; then carry this Diftance upon the Line of 
Chords, putting each Point of your Compallls upon the correfpondent Points, from 60 to 60, 
denoting the Angle of the Center of an Hexagon. 

The 



Chap. i. of the Sz&amp;or. S3 

The Seftor bcin* thus opened, take upon each Line of Chords the Diftance of the two 
Points marked 72 from the Center, and lay it off upon the Line of Polygons, placing one 
Foot in the Center of the Joint ; then the other loot muft reach to the Point 5, which ap- 
pertains to a Pentagon, whofe Angle at the Center is 72 Degrees. 

Likewife in taking upon the Line of Chords the Diftance of the two Points, denoting go 4 
and laying it off upon the Line of Polygons, the Foot of your Compaffes muft meet the Point 
4, appertaining to a Square, whofe Angle of the Center is 90 Deg. and fo of others. 

Proof of the Line of Planes. 
Becaufe we have given two Methods for dividing the Line of Planes, one may ferve to 
prove the other; but (fill you may eafier know whether the Divifions be well made, in the 
following manner : Take between your Compaffes the Diftance of any Point upon this Line 
from the°Ccnter of the Joint, and lay it off from the fame Point on the other Side of the fame 
Line of Planes ; then the Foot of your Compaffes will fall upon the Number of a Plane four 
times greater than that which was taken towards the Center : and if again your Compaffes 
thus ouened mould be once more turned over, towards the End of the laid Line, the Point 
would'fall upon the Number of a Plane nine times greater. As, for Example-, if you take 
the Diftance from the Center to the Plane 2, in placing one Point of your Compaffes on 2* 
the other ought to fall upon 8 ; and by turning the Compaffes once more, one of it's Points 
muft fall upon 18, which contains 9 times 2. Moreover, in turning the Compaffes once 
more over, the other Point ought to fall upon the Number 32, containing 2, 16 times. If, 
laftly, you turn over the Compaffes again, it muft fall upon 50, and fo of other fimilar' 
Planes/ becaufe they are to each other as the Squares of their homologous Sides. It is this 
that facilitates the Divifion of the Line of Planes ; for having the firft, thefe are likewife 
had, viz. the 4th,- the 9th, the 16th, the 20th, the 25th, the 36th, .the 49th, and the 64th. 
Having found the 2d, the 8th, the 18th •, the 32d, and the 50th will be had : likewife hav- 
ing found tfie 3d, the 12th, the 27th, and the 48th will be had-, and fo of others. 

Proof of the Line of Solids. 
You may know whether this Line be well divided, in the following manner : Take be- 
tween your Compaffes the Diftance of fome Point on this Line from the Center of the Joint j 
then place one of it's Points, thus opened, upon this Point of Divifion, and turn the other 
Point over towards the End of the Line. Now this Point muft fall upon the Number of a 
Solid 8 times greater than that which was taken. Again, if the Compaffes be once more 
turned over, it will fall upon a Solid 27 times greater than that which was firft taken. As, 
for Example ; the F)iftance of the firft Solid from the Center-, will be equal to the Diftancfc 
from 8 to 27, and from 27 to 64. Likewife, twice the Diftance from the Center to 3, will 
be equal to the Diftance from 3 to 24. By the 4th Solid, the 32d will be had. Moreover 
the 5th Solid will give the 40th ; by the 6th the 48th Solid will be had ; and, in a word, by 
help of the 7th, the 56th Solid will be had -, becaufe fimilar Solids are to each other, as the 
Cubes of their homologous Sides, which facilitates the Divifion of the Line of Solids^ 

Proof of the Line of Metals. 

We have already mentioned, that the Divifion of this Line is founded upon Experiments 
made of the different Weights of a Cubic Foot of each of the fix Metals, as they are here?

From thefe different Weights of the fix Metals the beforementioned Table was calculated} 
by means of which the Line of Metals was divided. 

Now becaufe Tin is the lighted of the Laid fix Metals, it* is fnanifeft that if, for Example, 
a Ball of Tin is to be made of the fame Weight as a Ball of Iron, or Brafs, the Ball of Tin 
muft be greater than either of them -, as alfo the Ball of Iron ought to be greater than that of 
Brais, and fo on to that which will be the lead. Therefore fuppofing the Diameter of a Ball 
of Tin to be 1000, the Queftion is to find the Lengths of the Diameters of Iron and Brafs- 
Balls, that may be of the fame Weight as the Ball of Tin. 

Now to do this, you muft make a Rule of Three, whofe firft Term let always be the 
heavieft of the two Metals to be compared ; the fecond Term muft be the Weight of the 
Tin, and the third muft be the Number 64, which is the greateft Solid of the Table of So- 
lids, to which the Number 1000 anfwers. As, for Example -, to compare Iron, a Cubic 
Foot of which weighs 558 Pounds, with Tin, a Cubic Foot of which weighs 516 Pounds, 2 

P Ounces u 



£4 The Conftruciion and Ufes Book II, 

Ounces : Having reduced them all into Ounces, the 558 Pounds make 8928 Ounces ; and the 
516 Pounds, 2 Ounces, make 8258 Ounces: then lay, if 8928 gives 8258, What will 64 
give ? The Rule being finifhed, the fourth Term will be 59 and a fmall Remainder -, then 
look for the Number 59 in the Table of Solids, and the Number anfvvering thereto is 973 - 3 
inftead of which take 974, becaufe of the remaining Fraction : therefore, I fay, that the 
Diameter of the Ball of Iron muft be 974. In the fame manner, by making four other Rules 
of Proportion, you may know whether the Numbers, marked againft the four other Metals, 
are well calculated, and confequently, whether the Line of Metals be well divided. 



CHAP. II. 

Of the Ufe of the Scdor. 

TH E Ufes we mail here lay down, are only thofe that moft appertain to the Sector, 
and which by it can be better performed, than by any other Inflrument. 

SECTION I. 

Of the U S E of the Lint of equal Parts. 

U S E I. To divide a given Line into any Number of equal Parts ; for Example, into feven. 

Plate 7. TAKE between your CompafTes the propefed Line, as A B, and carry it, upon the Line 

Fig. 1. of equal Parts, to a Number on both Sides, that may eafily be divided by 7, as 70, whofe 7th 

Part is 10; or elfe the Number 140, whofe 7th Part is 20. Then keeping the Sector thus 
opened, fhut the Feet of your CompafTes, fo that they may fall on the Numbers 10 on each 
Leg of the Sector, if the Number 70 be ufed •, or upon the Numbers 20, if 140 be taken 
for the Length of the propofed Line ; and this opening of your CompafTes will be the 7th 
Part of the propofed Line. 

Note, If the Line to be divided be too long to be applied to the Legs of the Sector, only- 
divide one half, or one fourth of it by 7, and the double, or quadruple, of this 7th Part* 
will be the 7th Part of the whole Line. 

USE II. Several right Lines, conftituting the Perimeter of a Polygon, being given, one of 
which is fuppofed to contain any Number of equal Parts : to find how many of thefe Parts are 
contained in each of the other Lines. 

Take that Line's Length, whofe Meafure is known, bctwetn your CompafTes, and fet it 
6Ver, upon the Line of equal Parts, to the Number on each Side, expreffing it's Length. 
The Sector remaining thus opened, carry upon it the Lengths of each of the other Lines, pa- 
rallel to the beforementioned Line, and the Numbers that each of them falls on will fhew 
their different Lengths: But if any one of the faid Lines doth not exactly fall upon the fame 
Number of the Lines of equal Parts, upon both Legs of the Sector; bat, for Inftance, one 
of the Points of the CompafTes falls upon 29, and the other upon 30 ; the Length of the faid 
Line will be 29 and a half. 

USE III. A right Line being given, and the Number of equal Parts it contains \ to 
take from it a leffer Line, containing any Number of it's Parts. 

Let, for Example, the propofed Line be 120 equal Parts, from which it is required to 
take a Line of 25. Firft take the propofed Line between your CompafTes, and then open 
the Sector, fo that the Feet of your CompafTes may fall upon 120, on the Line of equal Parts,. 
upon each Leg of the Sector : The Sector remaining thus opened, take the Diftance from 
25 to 25, and that will give the Line defired. It is manifeft, from the three aforementioned 
Ufes, that the Line of equal Parts* upon the Legs of the Sector, may very fitly Terve as a 
Scale for all kinds of plane Figures, provided that one of their Sides be known ; and that., 
by means of this Line, they may be augmented or diminifhed. 

USE IV. Two right Lines being given, to find a third Proportional: and three being 

given, to find a fourth. 

If there be but two Lines propofed, then take the Length of the firft between your Com- 
pafTes, and lay it off upon the Line of equal Parts from the Center, in order to know the 
Number whereon it terminates; then open the Sector, fo that the Length of the fecond Line 
may be terminated by the Length of the firft. The Sector remaining thus opened, lay off 
the Length of the fecond Line upon one of the Legs from the Center-, and, Note, the Num- 
ber whereon it terminates, and the Diftance between that Number, on both Legs of the 
Sector, will give the third Proportional required, 

Let, 



Chap. z. of the Se&amp;or. 55 

Let, for Example, the firft Line propofed be A B, 40 equal Parts ; and the fecond C D, 
20. Firft take the Length of 20 between your Compaffes, and opening the Sector, fet over Fig. 3. 
this Diftance upon 40, and 40 on each Leg of the Sector. TheSector remaining thus opened, 
take the Diftance from 20 to 20, which will be the Length of the third Proportional fought; 
which being mcafured, on the Line of equal Parts, from the Center, you will find it 10 ; 
for As 40 is to 20, So is 20 to 10. 

But if three Lines be given, and a fourth Proportional to them be required ; take the fecond 
Line between your Com paffes, and, opening the Sector, apply this Extent to the Ends of the 
firft, laid off from the Center, on both Legs of the Sector. The Sector being thus opened^ 
lay off the third Line from the Center, and the Extent between the Number, whereon it ter- 
minates on both Legs of the Sector, will be the fourth Proportional required. 

Let the firft of the three Lines be 60, the fecond 30, and the third 50 •, carry the Length 
of 30 to the Extent from 60 to 60 ; and the Sector remaining thus opened, take the Diftance 
from 50 to 50, which is 25, and this will be the fourth Proportional fought: for 60 Is to 30! 
As 50 to 25. 

U S E V. To divide a Line into any given Proportion. 

As for Example •, to divide a Line into two Parts, which may be to each other as 40 is to 
70: Firft add the two Numbers together, and their Sum will be no; then take between 
your Compaffes the Length of the Line propofed* which fuppofe 165, and carry this Length 
to the Diftance, from 110 to 110, on both Legs of the Sector. The Sector remaining thus 
opened, take the Extent from 40 to 40, and alfo from 70 tO 70 ; the firft of the two will 
give 60, and the latter 105, which will be the Parts of the Line propofed ; for 40 Is to 70, 
As 60 is to 105. 

USE VI. To open the Setter, fo that the two Lines of equal Parts may make a right Angle. 

Find three Numbers, that may exprefs the Sides of a right-angled Triangle, as 3, 4, or 5* 
or their Equimultiples ; but fince it is better to have greater Numbers, let us take 60, 80, 
and 100. Now having taken, between your Compaffes, the Diftance from the Center of the 
Sector to 100, open the Sector, fo that one Point of your Compaffes, fet upon 80 on oneLeg* 
may fall upon 60, of the Line of equal Parts, upon the other Leg; and then the Sector will 
be fo opened, that the two Lines of equal Parts make a right Angle. 

USE VII. To find a right Line equal to the Circumference of a given Circle. 

The Diameter of a Circle is to the Circumference almoft as 50 to 157 ; therefore take* 
between your Compaffes, the Diameter of the Circle, and fet it over, upon the Legs of the 
Sector, from 50 to 50, on both Lines of equal Parts. The Sector remaining thus opened, 
take the Diftance from 157 to 157, between your Compaffes, and that will be almoft equal 
to the Circumference of the propofed Circle ; I fay almoft, for the exact Proportion of the 
Diameter of a Circle to it's Circumference hath not yet been Geometrically found *. 

SECTION II. 

Of the U S E of the Line of Planes. 

U S E I. To augment or diminijh any Plane Figures in a given Ratio. 

LET, for Example, tiie Triangle A B C be given, and it is required to make another Tri- Fig. 4. 
angle fimilar, and triple to it. 

Take the Length of the Side A B between your Compaffes, and open the Sector, fo that 
the Points of your Compaffes fail upon 1 and 1, on each Linecf Planes ; the Sector remain- 
ing thus opened, take the Diftance from the third Plane to the third, on each Leg of the 
Sector, which will be the Length of the homologous Side to the Side A B. After the fame 
manner may the homologous Sides to the other two Sides of the given Triangle be found* 
and of thefe three Sides may be formed a Triangle triple to the propofed one. Note, If the 
propofed Plane Figure hath more than three Sides, it muft be reduced into Triangles, by 
drawing of Diagonals. 

If a Circle is to be augmented or diminifhed, you muft proceed in the fame manner with 
it s Diameter. 

U S E II. Two fimilar Plane Figures being given ; to find the Ratio between them. 
Take either of the Sides of one of the Figures, and open the Setter, fo that it may Fall 
upon the fame Number or Divifion, on the Line of Planes, on both Legs of the Sector. 
Then take the homologous Side of the other Figure, and apply that to fome Number or Di- 
vifion on both Legs of the Sector ; and then the two Numbers, on which the homologous 
Sides fall, will exprefs the Ratio of the two Figures. As fuppofe the Side a b, of the lefter Fig. 5. 
figure, falls upon the fourth Plane; and the homologous Side A B, of the greater, falls upon 
the fixth Plane, the two Planes are to each other as 4 to 6. But if the Side of a Figure is ap- 
plied to the Extent of fome Plane, on both Legs of the Sector, and the homologous Side can- 



not 



* No, nor never will, it being impoffible. The mil exatl Proportion in /mall Numbers, is that of Adrian Mtetivi. 

'*■ 113 to k;. j r j j

^6 ihe Conjlruciion ana Ufes Book II. 

not be adjufted parallel to it, fo as it may fall on a whole Number on both Legs of the Sec- 
tor ; then you mult place the Side of the firft Figure upon fome other Number, on each Leg* 
'till a whole Number is found on both Legs of the Sector, whofe Extent is equal to the 
Length of the homologous Side of the other Figure, to avoid Fractions. 

If the propofed Figures are fo great, that their Sides cannot bo applied to the Opening of 
the Legs of the Sector, take the half, third, or fourth Parts of any of the two homologous 
Sides of the find Figures, and compare them together, as before, and you will have the Pro- 
portion of the laid Figures. 

USE III. To open the Seclcr, fo that the two Lines of Planes may make a right Angle. 
Take between your Compaflls the Extent of any Piane from the Centrr of the Sector ; a?, 
for Example, the 40th : then apply this opening of your Compaffes, upon the Line of Planes, 
on both Sides, to a Number equal to half the precedent one, which, in this Example, is 
20-, then the two Lines of Planes will be at right Angles: becaufe, by the Conftruction of 
the Line of Planes, the Number 40, which may repiefent the longtft Side of a Triangle, 
fignifies a Plane equal to two other fimilar Planes, denoted by the Number 20 upon the Legs 
of the Sector: Whence, from Prop. 48. lib. i. Eucl. the aforenamed Angle is aright one. 

USE IV. To make a plane Figure fimilar and equal to two other given fimilar plane Figures. 

Open the Sector (by the precedent Ufe) fo that the Lines of Planes be at right Angles, and 
carry any two homologous Sides, of the two propofed Figures, upon the Line of Plants, 
from the Center, the one upon one Leg, and the other upon the other Leg ; and then theDi- 
ftance of the two Numbers found will give the homologous Side of a plane Figure fimilar and 
equal to the two given ones. 

As, for Example, the Side of the leftfer Figure being laid off from the Center, will reach 
to the fourth Plane ; and the homologous Side of the greater Figure, likewife laid off upon 
the other Leg, will extend to the ninth Piane : then the Diftance from 4 to 9 is the homo- 
logous Side of a Figure equal to the two propofecf ones, by means of which it will be eafy to 
make a Figure fimilar to them. 

By means of this Ufe may be added together any Number of fimilar plane Figures, viz. 
in adding together the two firft, and then adding their Sum to the third, and fo on. 

USE V. Two fimilar unequal plane Figures being given ; to find a third equal to their 

Difference.. 

Open the Sector, fo that the*two Lines of Planes may make a right Angle ; then lay oft- 
one Side of the lefler Figure from the Center of the Sector. This being done, take the ho- 
mologous Side of the greater Figure, and fet one Foot of your Companies upon the Number 
whereon the firft Side terminates, and the other Point will fall on the other Leg, upon the 
Number required. 

As, for Example ; having laid off the Side of the leiTer Figure from the Center, which falls 
upon the Number 9, take the Length of the homologous Side of the greater Figure, and fet- 
ting one Foot of your Compaffes upon the Number 9, the other will fall on the Number 4 
of the other Leg; therefore taking the Diftance of the Number 4 from the Center of the: 
Sector, that will be the homologous Side of a Figure fimilar and equal to the Difference of the 
two given Figures, whofe Ratio is as 9 to 13. 

USE VI. To find a mean Proportional between two given Lines. 

Lay off both the given Lines upon the Line of equal Parts, in order to have their Lengths 
expreffed in Numbers; the lefler of which fuppofe 20, and the greater 45 : Then open the 
Sector, fo that the Diftance from 45 to 45, of the Lines of Planes, be equal in Length to the 
greater Line. The Sector remaining thus opened, take the Diftance from 20 to 20 of the 
Line of Planes, which will be the mean Proportional fought •, and having meafured it upon 
the Line of equal Parts from the Center, you will find it to be 30: for As 20 is to 30, So is 
30 to 45. 

But becaufe the greateft Number on the Line of Planes is 64, if any one of the Lines pro- 
pofed be greater than 64, the Operation muft be made with their half, third, or fourth Parts, 
in the following manner: Suppofe the leiTer Number be 32, and the greater 72 ; open the 
Sector, fo that half of the greater Number, viz. 36, may be equal to the Diftance from 36 
to 36, of the Line of Planes, upon both Legs of the Sector-, and then the Diftance from 16 
to 16 doubled, will be the mean Proportional fought. 

SECTION III. 

Of the U S E S of the Line of Polygons. 

USE I. To infer ibe a regular Polygon in a given Circle. 

Fig. 6. TA KE the Semidiameter A C, of the given Circle, between your Compaffes, and adjuft it 

to the Number 6\ upon the Line of Polygons, on each Leg of the Sector •, and the Sector 
remaining thus opened, take the Diftance of the two eciual Numbers, cxDreffing the Num- 
ber 



Chap. 2. of the Sector. 57 

her of Sides the Polygon is to have : for Example ; take the Diftance From 5 to 5, to in- 
fcribr a Pentagon ; from 7 to 7 for a Heptagon, and fo of others : either of thefe Diftances, 
c-ncd about the Circumference of the Circle, will divide it into fo many equal Parts. And 
thus you may cafily defcribe any regular Polygon, from the equilateral Triangle to the Do- 
decagon. 

USE II. To defcribe a regular Polygon upon a given right Line. 
If for Example, the Pentagon of Fig. 6. is to be defcribed upon the Line AB: Take the Fig. $. 
Length of the Paid Line between your Compafles, and appiy it to the Extent of the Numbers 
r ,- &amp; o'i the Line of Polygons : The Sector remaining thus opened, take* upon the fame 
Lines the Extent from 6 to 6, which will be the Semidiameter of the Circle the Polygon is 
to be 'inferibed in ; therefore if, with this Diftance, you defcribe, from the Ends of the given 
L he A B, two .Arcs of a Circle, their Interferon will be the Center of the Circle. 

' If an Heptagon was propofed, apply the Length of the given Line to the Extent of the 
Numbers 7 and 7, on both Legs of the Sector, and always take the Extent from 6 to 6, to 
find the Center of the Circle ; in which it will be eafy to inferibe an Heptagon, each Side of 
which will be equal to the given Line. 

USE III. To cut a given Line, as DE, into extreme and mean Proportion. 

Apply the Length of the given Line to the Extent of the Numbers 6 and 6, on both Fig. 7. 
Sides, liuon the Line of Polygons ; and the Sector remaining thus opened, take the Extent 
of the Numbers 10 and 10, on both Legs of the Sector, which are thofe for a Decagon. 
This Extent will give D F* the greateft Segment of the propofed Line, becaufe the greateft: 
Segment of the Radius of a Circle, cut into mean and extreme Proportion, is the Chord of 
26 Decrees, which is the 10th Part of the Circumference. 

If the greater Segment is added to the Radius of the Circle, fo as to make but one Line* 
the Radius will be the greater Segment* and the Chord of 36 Degrees will be the lefler Seg- 
ment. 

USE IV. Upon a given Line D F, to defcribe an Jfofceles Triangle, having the Angles 

at the Bafe double to that at the Vertex. 

Open the Sector, fo that the Ends of the given Line may fall upon 10 and 10, of the Fig. 8. 
Line of Polygons, upon each Leg of the Sector. The Sector remaining thus opened, take 
the Diftance from 6 to 6, and this will be the Length of the two equal Sides of the Triangle 
to be made. 

It is manifeft that the Angle, at the Vertex of this Triangle, is 36 Degrees, and that 
each of the Angles at the Bafe is 72 Degrees ; but the Angle of 36 Degrees, is the Angle of 
the Center of a Decagon. 

U S E V. To open the Seclor fo, that the two Lines of Polygons may make a right Angle 

Take between your Compaffes the Diftance of the Number 5, from the Center, on the Line 
of Polygons •, then open the Sector, fo that this Diftance may be applied to the Number 6 
on one Side, and to the Number 10 on the other, and then the two Lines of Polygons will 
make a right Anglo ; becaufe the Square of the Side of a Pentagon is equal to the Square of 
the Side of a Htxagon, together with the Square of the Side of a Decagon. 

SECTION IV. 

Of the USES of the Line of Chords. 

USE I. To open the Seclor, fo that the two Lines of Chords may make an Angle of any 

Number of Degrees. 

FIRST take the Diftance, upon the Line of Chords, from the Center of the Joint, to 
the Number of Degrees propofed ; then open the Sector, fo that the Diftance, from 60 to 
60 on each Leg, be equal to the aforefaid Diftance, and then the Lines of Chords will make 
the Angle required. 

As to make an Angle of 40 Degrees ; take the Diftance of the Number 40 from the Fig. 9; 
Center, then open the Sector, 'till the Diftance from 60 to 60, be equal to the faid Diftance 
of 40 Degrees. If a right Angle be required, take the Diftance of 90 Degrees from the Cen- 
ter, and then let the Diftance from 60 to 60 be equal to that, and fo of others. 

USE II. The Seclor being opened, to find the Degrees of it's Opening. 

Take the Extent from 60 Degrees to 60 Degrees, and lay it off upon the Line of Chords 
from the Center ; then the Number, whereon it terminates, fheweth the Degrees of it's 
Opening. 

Sights are fometimes placed upon the Line of Chords, by means of which Angles are taken, 
in adding to the Sector a Ball and Socket, and placing it upon a Foot, to elevate it to the 
Height of the Eye : but thefe Operations are better performed with other Inftruments.

^ 8 The ConjlruEiion and Ufes Book 11, 

USE IH. To make a right-lined Angle, upon a given Line, of any Number of Degrees. 

Defcribe, upon the given Line, a circular Arc, whofe Center Jet be the Point whereof 
the Angle is to be made ; then lit off the Radius, from 60 to 60, on the Lines of Chore's, 
The Sector remaining thus opened, take the Diftance of the two Numbers upon each Leg, 
exprefiing the propofed Degrees, and lay it from the Line upon the Arc defcribed. Laftly, 
draw a right Line from the Center, through the End of the Arc, and it will make the Angle 
propofed. 

Suppofe, for Example, an Angle of 40 Degrees be to be made at the End B, of the Line 
AB; having defcribed any Arc about the Point B, always lay off the faid Radius from 60 
to 60 on the Line of Chords (becaufe the Radius of a Circle is always equal to the Chord of 
60 Degrees), and lay off the Diftance of 40 Deg. and 40 Dtg. from C to D. Laftly, draw- 
ing a Line through the Points B and D, the Angle of 40 Degrees will be had. Vid. Fig. 10. 

By this Ufe a Figure, whole Sides and Angles are known, may be drawn. 

USE IV. A right-lined Angle being given -, to find the Number of Degrees it contains. 

About the Vertex of the given Angle defcribe the Arc of a Circle, and open the Sector, 
fo that the Diftance from 60 to 60, on each Leg, be equal to the Radius of the Circle. 
Then take the Chord of the Arc between your Compaffes, and carrying it upon the Legs of 
the Sector, fee what equal Number, on each Leg, the Points of your Compaffes fall on, and 
that will be the Quantity of Degrees the given Angle contains. 

U S E V. To take the Quantity of an Arc, of any Number of Degrees, upon the Cir- 
cumference of a given Circle. 

Open the Sector, fo that the Diftance from 60 to 60, on each Line of Chords, be equal to 
the Radius of the given Circle. The Sector remaining thus opened, take the Extent of the 
Chord of the Number of Degrees upon each Leg of the Sector, and lay it off upon the Cir- 
cumference of the given Circle. 

By this Ufe may any regular Polygon be inferibed in a given Circle, as well as by the 1 ine 
of Polygons, viz. in knowing the Angle of the Center, by the Method and Table before 
expreffed, in the Conftruction of the Line of Polygons. 

For Example; to make a Pentagon by means of the Line of Chords : Having found the 
Angle of the Center, which is 72 Degrees, open the Sector, fo that the Diftance from 60 to 
60, on each Leg of the Sector, be equal to the Radius of the given Circle ; and then take the 
Extent from 72 to 72, on each Leg, between your Compaffes, which carried round the Cir- 
cumference, will divide it into five equal Parts, and the live Chords being drawn, the Poly- 
gon will be made. 

USE VI. To defcribe a regular Polygon upon the gh en right Line F G. 

As, for Example, to make a Pentagon, whofe Angle of the Center is 72 Degrees ; open 
the Sector, fo that the Diftance from 72 Degrees to 72 Degrees, on each Line of Polygons, 
be equal to the Length of the given Line. The Sector remaining thus opened, take the 
Diftance from 60 to 60, on each Leg, between your Compaffes ; with this Diftance, about 
the Ends of the given Line, as Centers, defcribe two Arcs interfering each other in D ; and 
this D will be the Center of a Circle, whofe Circumference will be divided, by the given Line, 
into five equal Parts. 

SECTION V. 

Of the U S E S of the Line of Solids. 

USE I. To augment or diminifh any Jimilar Solids in a given Ratio. 

Fig 12. LET, for Example, a Cube be given, and it is required to make another double to it. 

Carry the Side of the given Cube to the Diftance of fome equal Number, on both Lines of 
Solids, at pleafure ; as, for Example, to 20 and 20. The Sector being thus opened, take 
the Extent, on both Legs of the Sector, of a Number double to it, that is, of 40 and 40 j 
and this is the Side of a Cube double the propofed one. 

If a Ball or Globe be propofed, and it be required to make another thrice as big ; carry 
the Diameter of the Ball to the Diftance of fome equal Number, on both Lines of Solids, at 
pleafure, as to 20 and 20 ; then take the Diftance from 60 to 60 (becaufe 60 is thrice 20), 
and that will be the Diameter of a Ball three times greater than the propofed one, becaufe 
Balls are to each other as the Cubes of their Diameters. 

If, again, a Cheft, in figure of a right-angled Parallelepipedon, contains three Meafu res 
of Grain, and it be required to make another fimilar Cheft to contain five Meafures •, open 
the Sector, fo that the Diftance from 30 to 30, on each Line of Solids, be equal to the 
Length of the Bafe of the Cheft ; then the Diftance from 50 to 50, on each Leg, will be the 
homologous Side of that Solid to be made. Again, apply the Breadth of the Bafe to the Di- 
ftance of the faid Numbers 30 and 30, and then the Diftance from 50 to 50 will be the ho- 
mologous 



&gt; iK- I I. 



Chap. 2. of the Se£br. 5 9 

mologous Side to the faid Breadth. Now having made a Parallelogram with thefe two 
Lengths, your next thing will be to find the Depth : To do which, open the Sector, fo that the 
Diftance from 30 to 30 be equal to the Depth of the given Cheft; then the Diftance from 50 
to 50 will be the Depth of the Cheft to be made. This being done, it will be eafy to make 
the Parallelepipedon, containing the five propofed Meafures. 

If the Lines are fo long, that they cannot be applied to the Legs of the Sector, take any 
of their Parts, and with them proceed as before ; then the refpective Parts of the required 
Dimenfions will be had. 

USE II. Two fimilar Bodies being given ; to find their Ratio. 

Take either of the Sides of one of the propofed Bodies between your CompafTes, and having 
carried it to the Diftance of fome equal Number, on each Line of Solids, take the homologous 
Side of the other Solid, and note the Number on each Leg it falls upon ; and then the faid 
Numbers will fbew the Ratio. of the two fimilar Solids. 

But if the Side of the fiift Solid be fo applied to fome Number on each Leg of the Sector, 
that the homologous Side of the other cannot be applied to the Extent of fome Number on 
each Leq; •, then you muft apply the Side of the firft Solid to fuch a Number on each Line, 
that the Length of the Side of the fecond Solid may fail upon fome whole Number on each 
Line of Solids, to avoid Fractions. 

USE III. To conjlruff and divide a Line, whofeUfe is to find the Diameters of Cannon- 
Balls. 

It is found, by Experience, that an Iron Ball, three Inches in Diameter, weighs 40 Pounds % 
whence it will be eafy to find the Diameters of other Balls of different Weights, and the 
fame Metal, in the following manner: Open the Sector, fo that the Eiftance from the 4th 
Solid to the 4th Solid, on each Line of Solids, be equal to three Inches The Sector re- 
maining thus opened, take upon the Lines of Solids the Diftances of all the Numbers, from 
1 to 64, on one Leg, to the fame Numbers on the other Leg •, then lay off all thefe Lengths 
upon a right Line drawn on a Ruler, or upon one of the Legs of the Sector, and where the 
Diameters terminate, denote the Weights of the Balls. 

But now to mark the Fractions of a Pound, as 4» -■* t» open the Sector, fo that the Di- 
ftance of the 4th Solids on each Leg of the Sector, be equal to the Diameter of a iJall of 
one Pound. The Sector remaining thus opened, the Diftance from the ift Solid to the ift 
on each Leg of the Sector, will give the Diameter for * of a Pound ; from the 2d to the 2d, 
for ; of a Pound ■, ard from the 3d to the 3d, for 1 of a Pound, and fo of others. When the 
Diameters of Balls are known, the Diameters or Bores of Cannon, to which they are proper, 
will likewifc be known : but there are commonly two or three Lines given for the Vent of 
great Balls, and for leffer ones in proportion. The Diameters of Balls are meafured with 
lphcrick CompafTes, as will be more fully explained among the Inftruments for Artillery. 

USE IV. To make a Solid fimilar and equal to the Sum of any Number of fimilar given 

Solids. 

Open the Sector, and apply either of the Sides of either of the Bodies to the fame Num- 
ber on each Line of Solids ; then note on v/hat equal Numbers, on both Legs of the Sector, 
the homologous Sides of the other Solids fall. This being done, add together the faid 
Numbers, and take the Extent, on both Lines of Solids, of the Number arifing from that 
Addition •, and this Extent will be the homologous Side of a Body, equal and fimilar to the 
Sum of the'given Bodies. 

Example •, Suppofe the Side chofen of the firft Solid be applied to the fifth Solid, on each 
Leg of the Sector, and the homologous Sides of the others fall, the one on the 7th, and the 
other on the 8th Solid, on each Line of Solids ; add the three Numbers 5, 7, and 8 together, 
and their Sum is 20 •, therefore the Diftance from 20 to 20, on each Line of Solids, will be 
the homologous Side of a Body, equal and fimilar to the three others. 

USE V. Two fimilar and unequal Bodies being given ; to find a third fimilar and equal 

to their Difference. 

Open the Sector, and apply either of the Sides of either of the Bodies to fome equal Number 
on each Leg of the Sector, and fee what equal Numbers, on both Legs, the homologous 
Sides of the other Solids fall upon •, then fubftract the leffer Number from the greater, and 
take the Diftance from the remaining Number, on one Line of Solids, to the fame on the 
other ; and this will be the homologous Side of a Body, equal to the Difference of the two 
given ones. 

As, for Example ; the Side of the greateft being fet over, upon the Line of Solids, from 
15 to 15, the homologous Side of the leffer will be equal to the Diftance from 9 to 9-, then 
taking 9 from 15, there remains 6 : therefore the Diftance from 6 to 6 will be the homolo- 
gous Side of the Solid fought. 

USE VI. To find two mean Proportionals between two given Lines. 
For Example-, fuppofe there are two Lines, one of which is 54, and the other 16: open 
the Sector, fo that the Diftance from 54 to 54, on each Leg of the Sector, be equal to the 

Length 



Co The Conftfuciion and Ufcs Book II, 

Length cf the longeft Line. The Sector remaining thus opened, the Diftance from 16 td 
1 6, on each Leg, will be equal to the greater or' the mean Proportionals, and will be found 
to be 36. Again, fhutting the Legs of the Sector clofer, 'till the Diftance between 54 and 
54, on each Leg, be equal to 36 ; then the Diftance from 16 to 16 will be the lelTer of the 
mean Proportionals, and will be found to be 24: AVhence thefe four Lines will be in conti- 
nual Proportion, 54, 36, 24, 16. 

If the Lines be too Jong, or the Numbers of their equal Parts too great* you muff, takes 
their half's, thirds, or fourths, &amp;c. and proceed as before. For Example •, to find two mean 
Proportionals between two Lines, one of which is 32, and the other 256, take the fourth 
Parts of both the Lines, which are 8 and 64. This being done, open the Sector, fo that the 
Diftance from 8 to 8, on each Line of Solids, be equal to 8 ; then take the Dillance from 64- 
to 64, and that gives 16, for ~ of the firft of the two mean Proportionals. Again, open the 
Sector, fo that the Diftance from 8 to 8 be equal to 16 ; the Sector being thus opened, the 
Diftance from 64 to 64 will give 16, for 4 of the fecond of the mean Proportionals fought: 
whence the mean Proportionals are 64 and 1283 for 32, 64, 128, 256, are proportional. 

USE VII. To find the Side of a Cube equal to the Side of a given Parallelepipedon. 

Firft, find a mean Proportional between the two Sides of the Bafe of the Parallelepipedon 5 
then between the Number found, and the Height of the Parallelepipedon, find the firft of two 
mean Proportionals, which will be the Side or the Cube fought. 

For Example, let the two Sides of the Parallelepipedon be 24 and 54, and it's Height 63 5 
the Side of a Cube equal to it is fought. 

Open the Sector, fo that the Diftance between 54 and 54, on the Line of Planes, be equal 
to the Side of 54 •, then take the Diftance from 24 to 24 on the fame Line, which, meafured 
upon the Line of equal Parts, will give 36 for a mean Proportional. This being done, take 
36 between your Cornpaffes, and open the Sector, fo that the Points of the Compaffes may 
fall upon 36 and 06, on each Line of Solids ; then take the Diftance from 63 to 63 on the 
Lines of Solids, which will be lound almoft 44 ;, for the Side of a Cube equal to the given 
Parallelepipedon. 

USE VIII. To cov.flruft mid divide a Gauging-Rod to meafurt Cajks, and other the like 

Veffels, proper to hold Liquors. 

j:'g, 1 3 The Gauging-Rod, of which we are now going to fpeak, is a Ruler made of Metal, divid- 

ed into certain Parts, whereby the Number of Pints contained in a VelTel may be found, in 
putting it in at the Bung-hole, 'till it's End touches the Angle, made by the Bottom, with 
that part of the Side oppofite to the Bung- hole, as the Line A C diagonally fituated. 

The Gauging-Rod being thus pofited, the Divifion, anfwering to the middle of the Eung- 
hole, fhews the Quantity of Liquor, or Number of Pints the Veifel, when full, holds. 

But it is neceffary to change the Pofition of the aforefaid Rod, fo that it's End C may 
touch the Angle of the other Bottom B, in order to fee whether the middle of the Bung- hole 
be in the middle of the VelTel ; for if there is any Difference, half of it mult be taken. 

The \J{c of this Gauging-Rod is very eafy : for, without any Calculation by it, the Dimen- 
fions of Cafks may immediately be taken ; all the Difficulty confift only in well dividing it. 

Now, in order to divide it, a little Calk, holding a Septier, or Gallon, mult be made fimi- 
lar to the Veffels that are commonly ulld ; for this Rod will not exactly give the Dimenfions 
of difiimilar Veffels, that is, fuch that have the Diameters of the Pleads, thofe of the Bungs, 
and the Lengths not proportional to the Diameters of the Head, Bung, and Length of that 
which the Divifions of the Rod are made by. 

Now fuppofe the Diameter, at the Head of a Calk, be 20 Inches, the Diameter of the 
Bung 22, and the interior Length 30 Inches •, this VelTel will hold 27 Septiers of Paris Mea- 
fure, and it's Diagonal Length, anfwering to the middle of the Bung-hole, will be 25 Inches, 
9 Lines and a half, as is eafy to find by Calculation : becaufe in the right-angled Triangle 
ADC, the Side CD being 15 Inches, and DA 21, by adding their Squares together, you 
will have (per Prop. 47. lib. 1. End.) the Square of the Hypothenufe A C ; and by extract- 
ing the Square Root, A C will be had. 

According to the fame Proportions a Cafk, whofe Dimenfions are one Third of the former 
ones, will contain one Septier, or eight Pints ; that is, if the Diameter of the Plead be 6 In- 
ches, and 8 Lines ; that of the Bung 7 Inches, 8 Lines ; the Length 8 Inches, 8 Lines j and 
it's Diagonal 8 Inches, 7 Lines. 

Another Cafk, whofe Dimenfions are half of that before-mentioned, will contain one Pint ; 
that is, if the Diameter of the Head be 3 Inches, 4 Lines ; that of the Bung 3 Inches, 8 
Lines •, the interior Length of the Cafk 5 Inches ; and the Diagonal, anfwering to the middle 
of the Bung-hole, 4 Inches, 3 Lines and a half. 

Now take a Rod about 3 or 4 Feet long, and chufe either of the three Meafures, which 
you judge mult proper : As, for Example ; if you will make Divifions for Septiers upon the 
Rod, make a Point, in the middle of it's Breadth, diftant from one of it's Ends, 8 Inches, 
7 Lines, and there make the Divifion for one Septier upon it •, double that Extent, and there 
make a Mark for 8 Sept'urs &gt; triple the fame Extent, and there make a Mark for 27 Septiers -, 

quadruple 



Chap. 2. of the Sz&amp;or. 61 

quadruple it, and there make a Mark for 64 Septiers; becaufe fimilar Solids are to each other, 
as the Cubes of their homologous Sides. 

Again, to make Divifions upon it for the other Septiers, take between your Compaffes the 
Length or 8 Inches, 7 Lines ; let over this Diftance, upon each Line of Solids of your Sec- 
tor horn the firft Solid to the firft. The Sector remaining thus opened, take the Diftance 
from the fecond Solid to the fecond, which mark upon the Rod for the Divifion of two Sep- 

Acrain ; take the Diftance from the third Solid to the third, which mark upon the Rod 
for the Lenoth of the Diagonal, agreeing to three Septiers, and fo on ; by which means the 
Rod will be\hvided, for taking the Dimenfions of Veffels in Septiers. With the fame facility 
may the Divifions for Pints be made upon the Rod; for half of the Diftance of the Divifion 
of two Septiers, will give the Divifion lor two Pints ; half of the Diftance of the Divifion for 
three Septiers, will give the Divifion for three Pints ; half of the Diftance of the Divifion for 
four Septiers, will give the Divifion for four Pints, and fo on. 

If the Sector be not long enough to take the Diagonal Lengtli anfwerable to one Septier, 
from the firft Solid to the firft, take the Diagonal Length anfwerable to one Pint •, and having 
divided the Rod for any Number of Pints, the Diagonal Lengths of the fame Number of 
Septiers, may be had, by doubling the Diagonal Lengths of the Pints. As, for Example; if 
the Diagonal Length for 6 Pints be doubled, that Diftance will be the Diagonal Length of a 
Veffel holding 6 Septiers : Alfo if the Diagonal Length of 7 Pints be doubled, the Length 
of the Diagonal of a Veffel, holding 7 Septiers, will be had ; and fo of other Diagonal Lengths. 

If the Diagonal Length is yet too long to be applied to the Diftance of the Divifion for the 
firft Solid, on each Leg of the Sector, it's half muft be applied to the fame ; and the Sector 
remaining thus opened, take the Diftance of the Divifions for the fecond Solid on both Lines 
oi Solids, and double it ; then you will have the Diagonal Length of a Veffel holding two 
pints. Having again taken the Diftance of the Divifion for the third Solid upon each Leg of 
the Sector, which Diftance being double, the Diagonal Length of a Vefle 1 holding three Pints 
will be had, and may be marked upon your Rod; and fo of others. 

The Divifions for Septiers go acrofs the whole Breadth of the Rod, upon which are their 
refpective Numbers graved ; and the Divifions for Pints are fhorter than the others, for their 
better Diftinftion. 

In order for this Gauging-Rod to ferve to take the Quantity of Liquor contained in diffe- 
rent diffimilar Veffels, other Divifions may be made upon it's Faces, according to the diffe- 
rent Proportions of their Lengths and Diameters, and at the bottom of the faces muft be 
writ the Diameters and Lengths by which the Divifions were made: For Example ; at the bot- 
tom of the Face, upon which the precedent Divifions were made, there is wrote, the Diame- 
ter of the Head 20, the Diameter of the Bung 22, and the Length 30. 

If, for dividing another Face, you ufe a Veffel, whofe Diameter of the Head is 21 Inches, 
that of the Bung 23, and the interior Length 27 ' Inches ; this Veffel is fhorter than that 
before-named, but contains almoft the fame Quantity of Liquor, when full, viz. 27 Sep- 
tiers, and the Length of it's Diagonal will be 26 Inches. 

If another Veffel hath all it's Dimenfions ' of the precedent ones, this Veffel will hold one 
Septier, and it's Diagonal AC will be 8 Inches and 8 Lines in Length. Now by means of 
this Veffel, and it's Diagonal Length, you may divide the aforefaid Face in the Manner di- 
rected for dividing the firft Face, and at the Bottom of this Face you muft write, Diameter 
reduced 22, Length 17 \. 

If the four Faces of the Rod are divided, as before-named, you will have four different 
Gauges for gauging four different kinds of Veffels ; and by examining the Proportions of the 
■Diameters of the Heads and Lengths, you muft make ufe of fuch a Face accordingly. 

Inftead of ufing the Sector in dividing the before-mentioned Gauging-Rod, it is better 
ufing the Table of Solids. 

For having found, by Calculation, that the Length of the Diagonal of a Veffel, holding 27 
Septiers, is 6 Inches, it will be eafy to find the Diagonals of Veffels of any propofed Big- 
neffes, having the fame Proportions to the Diameters reduced, as 22 to 27 f, or as 4 to 5. 

As, for Example ; it is required to find the Diameter of a Quarteau, or Firkin, which 
holds 9 Septiers ; feek, in the Table of Solids, the Number anfwering to the 9th Solid, which 
will be found 520 ; at the fame time find the correfpondent Number to the 27th Solid, which 
will be found 750 : then ftate a Rule of Three, in the following manner ; 750 : 520 : : 26 
: 18 ; whence 18 Inches will be the Length of the Diagonal of a Veffel holding 9 Septiers. 
The Coopers about Paris make their Veffels almoft in the Proportion of 4 to 5 ; as is, for 
Example, a half Muid, having 19 Inches 2 Lines in Diameter reduced, and 24 Inches in 
Length ; in which Cafe the Diagonal will be 22 Inches, 8 f Lines, as you will eafily find by 
Calculation. 

But, in general, as foon as the Proportions ufed in making Veffels are known, the Diago- 
nal of fome one of thofe Veffels, holding a known quantity of Septiers being firft found (per 
Prop. 47. lib. 3. Eucl.) you may afterwards find the Lengths of the Diagonals of all Veffels 
made in the fame proportion, by means of the aforefaid Table of Solids.

SECTION VI. 

Of the ConflruBion and Ufe of other kinds of Gauging- Rods. 

THE Gauging-Rod, of which we have already fpoken, ferves only to find the Quantity 
of Liquor contained in fimilar Vtifels •, but that which we are now going to mention, may 
be ufed in taking the Dimenfions of difiimilar VefTels. 

In order to conftruct the firft Gauge of this kind, the Meafure which you ufe mud be de- 
termined, by comparing it with fome regular Veffel, as a Concave Cylinder, in which a 
Quart or a Gallon of Water being poured, you muft exactly note the Depth occupied by 
the Water. 

As, for Example, if a Gauge is to be made for Paris, where a Pint is 48 Cubic Inches, 
or 61 Cylindrick Inches, you will find, by Calculation, that a Concave Cylinder, 3 Inches, 
n 1 Lines in Diameter, and the like Number in Depth, contains one Pint of Paris ; and a 
Cylinder, whole Dimenfions are double the aforefaid ones, that is, 7 Inches, 10 I Lines, will 
hold one Septier : for fimilar Solids ate to each other, as the Cubes of their like Sides. 
£ig. ,4, This being fuppofed, lay off that Length of 3 Inches 11 4 Lines, upon one Face of the 

Rod, as often as the Length of the Rod will admit, and mark Points, whereon fet 1, 2, 3, 
4, 5, &amp;c. each of thefe Parts may be fubdivided into 4 or more. This Face, thus divided, 
is called the Face of equal Parts, and is ufed in meafuring the Lengths of VefTels. 

You muft likewife mark, upon another Face of the Rod, the Diameter of the Cylinder of 
3 Inches, 11 I Lines, and then the Diameters of Circles double, triple, quadruple, &amp;V. by 
any of the Methods before explained for dividing the Line of Planes on the Sector, the eafieifc 
v\„ , - and fhorteft of which is to make a right-angled Ifofceles Triangle ABC; each of the Legs 

about the right Angle of which being 3 Inches, 1 1 4 Lines, the Hypothenufe B C will be 
the Diameter of a Circle double to that, whofe Diameter is 3 Inches, 1 1 4 Lines : therefore 
having produced one of the Legs AB towards D, lay off the faid Hypothenufe from A- 
towards D, and at the Point whereon it terminates mark the Number 2 ; then take the Di- 
ftance C 2, and having laid it off upon the Line AD, mark the Number 3 at the Point 
whreon it terminates. Again, take the Diftance C 3, and having laid it off upon the Line 
A D, there mark the Number 4, &amp;c. 

Note, A 4, which is the Diameter of a Circle quadruple the firft, is double A C, or 
A B ; becaufe Circles are to each other as the Squares of their Diameters : whence fince 
A B is 1, it's Square is alfo 1 ; and the Line A 4 being 2, it's Square muft confequently be 4. 

To ufe this Gauge, you muft firft apply the Face of equal Parts to the exterior Length of 
the Veffel, from which you muft take the Depth of the two Croes, that thereby the true in- 
terior Length may be had. 

This being done, apply the Face of Diameters to the Diameters of the Heads of the Veflel, 
and note the Number anfwering to them, and whether they are equal ; for if there be any 
Difference between the Diameters of the Heads, you muft add them together, and take half 
their Sum for the mean Head-Diameter. 

Again •, put the Rod downright in at the Bung-hole, in order to have the Diameter of the 
Bung, which add to the Head-Diameter, and take half the Sum for an arithmetical Mean ; 
this being multiplied by the Length of the Veffel, will give the Number of Pints the Vef- 
fel holds. 

As fuppofe the interior Length of a Veffel is 4 1 of the equal Parts of the Rod, the Dia-, 
meter at the Head 15, and the Bung-Diameter 17 ; add 15 to 17, and their Sum is 32, 
half of which is 16 ; which multiplied by the Length 4 J, and the Product j6 will give the 
Number of Pints the Veffel holds. 

Now to conftruct the fecond kind of Rods, it is found, by Experience, that a Cylinder, 
whofe Height and Diameter is 3 Foot, 3 Inches, and 6 Lines, holds 1000 Paris Pints. 

Then take upon a Ruler a Length of 3 Feet, 3 Inches, and 6 Lines, which divide into 
10 Parts, each of which will be the Height and Diameter of a Cylinder holding one Pint, 
(becaufe fimilar Cylinders are to each other as the Cubes of their Diameters). Again, divide 
each of thefe Parts into 10 more, which may eafily be done by help of the Line of Lines 
on the Sector; then each of thefe laft Parts will be the Height and Diameter of a Cylinder 
holding the 1000th part of a Pint: Every five of thefe fmall Parts being numbered, your 
Fig. 16. Rod will be made. One of thefe Rods, of 4 or 5 Feet in Length, will ferve to gauge great 

VefTels, as Pipes, csV. 

To ufe this Rod, you muft note how many of the fmall Divifions of the Rod the Diame- 
ters of the Head and Bung, as alfo the Length, contains. 

But, Note, by the Length of a Veffel is underftood the interior Length, which is the Di- 
ftance between the Plead and the Bottom ; and by the Diameters is underftood the interior 
Diameters included between the Staves. 

Note, alfo, If the Diameters at Top and Bottom are unequal, compare one of them with 
the Bung-Diameter, and the middle between thefe two is called the mean Diameter of the 
Veffel, 

Bur 



Chap. 2. of the Se£tar. 63 

But if the Diameters at Top and Bottom are unequal, add them together, and take half 
of their Sum, which is called the mean Diameter of the Head and Bottom •, then compare 
this mean Diameter with the Diameter at the Bung, add them together, and take half their 
Sum for the mean Diameter of the Veffel. 

Then fquarc the mean Diameter of the Veffcl, and multiply the faid Square by the Length 
of the Veffcl; then the Product will give you the Quantity of Liquor in ioooth Parts the 
Veffel holds-, 'and by cafting away the laft three Figures, you will have the Number of Pints 
contained in 'the Veffcl, when full. . 

Let, for Example, the Diameter at the Head be 58 Parts of the Guaging-Rod, and the 
Buna-Diameter 62; add thefe two Numbers together, and their Sum will be 120, whofe 
half 60 is the mean Diameter of the Veffel : then the Square of this mean Diameter will be 
2600 ; and if this Square be multiplied by the Length of the Veffel, which fuppofe 80, the 
Product will be 288000 •, and by taking away the three laft Figures* the Number of Paris 
Pints the Veffel holds will be 288. 

This way of Gauging is exact enough for Practice, when there is but a fmall Difference 
between the Bung and Head-Diameters, as are the Diameters of Paris-Muids ; but when the 
Difference between the Bung and Head-Diameters is confiderable, as in the Pipes of Anjou&gt; 
whofr- uno-Diameters are much greater than the Head-Diameters, Dimenfions taken in the 
beioi -directed manner will not give the Quantity of Liquor exact enough : But to render 
the ethod more exact, divide the Difference of the Bung and Head-Diameters into 7 Parts* 
anc idci 4 of them to the Head-Diameter, and that will give you the mean Diameter : for 
Example ■, if the Diameter of the Head is 50, and the Bung-Diameter 57, the mean Dia- 
met. r of the Veffcl will be 54; with which mean Diameter proceed as before. 

Having found by the Rod how many Paris Pints a Veffel holds, you may find how many 
other Mealur. s the fame Veffel holds, in the following manner : 

A Paris Pint of frefh Water weighs 1 Pound, 15 Ounces ; therefore you need but weigh 
the fought Mcafure full of Water, and by the Rule of Three you may have your Defire. 

As, lor Example ■, a certain Meafure of Water weighs 50 Ounces, and it is required to 
find how many of the fame Meafures is contained in a Paris-Muid, which holds 288 Pints : 
Say, by the Rule of Three, As 50 is to 31, So is 288 Pints to a fourth Number, which will 
be 178 4 of the faid Meafures. 

There may be marked Feet and Inches upon the vacant Faces of the aforefaid Gauging-^ 
Rod, each of which Inches may be fubdivided into four equal r'arts, which Will be a fecond 
means to gauge Veffcls ; the Feet are marked with Roman Characters, and the Inches with 
others. 

We have already faid, that a Paris Pint contains 61 Cylindrick Inches; therefore having 
the Solidity of a Veffel in Cylindrick Inches, it mull be divided by 61, to have the Number 
of Pints the Veffel holds. An Example or two will make this manifeft. 

Let the Length of a Veffel be 36 Inches, the Head-Diameter 23, and the Bung-Diameter 
25 ; add the two Diameters together, and their Sum will be 48, half of which is 24 for the 
mean Diameter. This Number 24 being fquared, will be $j6 ; and this Square being mul- 
tiplied by the Length 36, gives 20736 Cylindrick Inches : which being divided by 61, the 
Quotient will give 339 Pints, and about 5. 

If the Diameters and Lengths of Veffels are taken in fourth Parts of Inches, the laft Product: 
mud be divided by 3904, to have the Number of Pints contained in a Veffel, when full. 

Let, for Example, the Length of a Veffel be o,S i Inches, the Head-Diameter 23 Inches* 
and the Diameter at the Bung 25 ' Inches ; add the two Diameters together, and their Sum 
will be 48 , half of which will be 24 -i ; which, for eafe of Calculation, reduce to 4ths i 
97 is the Number to be fquared, which will be 9409 ; which multiply by 141, and that 
Product again by 35 ', reduced to 4ths of Inches, will give this Product 1326669 ; which 
being divided by 3904, the Quotient will (as before) be 339 Pints, and about ■£• 

The Conjlruftion and USE of a new Gauging-Rod. 

Mr Sauveur, of the Academy of Sciences, has communicated to us a new Gauging-Rod 
of his Invention, by means of which may be found, by Addition only, the Quantity of Li- 
quor that any Veffel holds, when full ; whereas hitherto Multiplication and Divifion has 
been ufed in Gauging. 

To make this Gauging-Rod, you muft firft chufe a Piece of very dry Wood, as Sorbaple Fig. 17. 
or Pear-tree, without Knots, about 5 Foot long, in Figure of a Parallelepipedon, and 6 or 
7 Lints in Breadth; Fig. 17. fhews it's four Faces. 

Now upon the firft of the four Faces are made Divifions for taking the Diameters of Veffels. 

The Divifions of the fecond Face ferves to meafure the Lengths of the Diameters. 

The Divifions upon the third Face are for finding the Contents of Veffels. 

And, Laftly, upon the fourth Face, the Numbers of Septiers and Pints, which the Veffel 
holds, are marked. 

The aforefaid Divifions are made in the following manner : 

firft, 

91 



64 2"^ Conftruclion and Ufes Book IL 

Firft, divide the fourth Face into Inches, and each Inch into 10 equal Faits y thofe Di- 
vifions denote Pints, and are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &amp;c. every 8 being Septiers, becauic 
1 Septier is 8 Pints : On the End of this fourth Face is written Pints and Septiers-. 

The Divisions of the Other three Faces are made by help of Logarithms, in manner fol- 
lowing. 

Note&gt; The Divifions of the fourth Face ferve as a Scale to the third, and ought no be 
contiguous to it. 

To divide the third Face of the Red. 

If you have a mind to place any Number upon the third Face of you:; Rod ; for Example, 
240: feek- in the Table of Logarithms for 240, or the nigheft Number to it, which will be 
found againft 251- in your Table •, then place 240- upon the third Face, over againft 252 Pints 
on the fourth Face,- and, proceeding in this manner, you may divide the third Face. 

But becaufe, in the Table of Logarithms, 24.0 doth not (land againft 251, but inftead 
thereof there (lands 2.39996, which nighly approaches it-, therefore to make the Divifions a.% 
exact as pofiible, you mult add 1 to r.he firft Number of the Logarithm 2.40, and then feek 
for 3.40, over againft which ftands 2512 •, which (hews, that the Logar. 240 mult be placed 
not over againft 251 of the Divifions of Pints, but againft 251 and two Parts of the Divifions 
of a Pint, fuppofed to be divided into 10 Parts more. You muff write Contents at one End 
of this third Face. 

The Manner of dividing the fecond Face. 

A Cylindrical VeSfel, whofe Length and Diameter is 3 Inches, 1 1 * Lines, holds one. Paris 
Pint •, therefore the firft part of the fecond Face, which is without Divifions, mufl be of 
that Length. This faid Length mud be laid off ten times, and more, if poflibie, upon the 
faid Face, upon which make occult Marks •, then one of thefe Part's muft be divided into 100 
more, upon a feparate Ruler, ferving as a Scale. 

This being done, fuppofe any Number is to be placed upon' the fecond Face ; as, for Ex- 
ample, 60: Seek in the Table of Logarithms for 60, which will be found againft 39 and 40, 
or ratheir againft 3981, without having regard to the Numbers 1, 2, 3, that precede it, 
and which are called Characterifticks : therefore I take 98, or 981, by efteeming one Pare 
divided into 10, upon the fmall Scale divided into 100, and I place this Diftance next to the 
third occult Point, which denotes three Centefms, or three Thousandths. You muft thus mark 
Divifions from 5 to 5, and every of thefe 5ths muft again be fubdivided into 5 equal Parts. 
Finally, upon the End of this Face, you muft write Lengths. 

The Manner of dividing the firft Face. 

The firft Part of this Face, which is not divided, reprefents the Diameter of a Cylindrical 
Veflel holding one Paris Pint - y therefore it's Length muft be 3 Inches, 114 Lines. 

And for dividing this Face, lay ofTupon it the Divifions of the fecond Face ; but inftead 
of writing 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, &amp;c. write their Doubles 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, &amp;c. and fubdl- 
Vide the Intervals into 10 Parts, and at the End of this Face write Diameters. 

The U S E of the New Ganging-Rod. 

Meafure the Length of the mean Diameter of the VefTel with the Face of Diameters of 

your Rod, which fuppofe to be 153.00. Likewife take the Length of the VefTel 

153.00 with the fecond Face of your Rod, which fuppofe to be 92 85 ; add thefe two 

92.85 Numbers together, then feek their Sum 245.85 upon the third Face, and over 

. againft it, on the fourth Face, you will have 36 Septiers, or 288 Pints. 

245.85 But to make the Ufe of this Rod general ; fuppofe the Weight of a Pint of 
frefh Water of fome Country be 50 Ounces Avoirdupoife-, then feek 31, the 
Number of Ounces Avoirdupoife a Paris Pint of frefh Water weighs, upon the fourth Face 
of Septiers of the Rod, which will be found againft 239.4 on the third Face. 
Likewife, againft 50 on the fourth Face, anfwers 260.2 on the third Face. 

Then from 260.2! f Again from 245.85 before found 

Take 239 / \ Take 20.80 



I. 



And there remains 20.8 j (And there remains 225.05 
Now againft this Number 225.05, on the third Face, you will find, on the fourth Face, 22 
Septiers 2 Pints, or 178 Pints, which is the Number of Pints of that Country a VefTel of the 
aforefaid Dimenfions holds. 

SECTION VII. 

Of the USE of the Line of Metals. 

USE I. The Diameter of a Ball, of any one of the fix Metals, being given ; to find the 
Diameter of another Ball of any one of them, which fh all have the fame Weight. 

OPEN the Sector, and taking the given Diameter of the Ball between your CompaiTes, 
apply it's Extremes to the Characters upon each Line of Metals, expreffing the Metal the Ball 

is 



Chap. 2. of the Seftor. 65 

is made of. The Sector remaining' thus opened, take the Diflance of the Characters of the 
Metal the fought Diameter is to be of, upon each Line of Metals, and this will be the Dia- 
meter 'fought. As, for Example, let A B be the Diameter of a Ball of Lead, and it be re- Fig. i8, 
ouired to find the Diameter of a Ball of Iron, having the fame Weight. Open the Sector, 
fo that the Diftance between the Points h and h be equal to the Line A B: The Sector re- 
maining thus opened, take the Diftance of the Points of S on each Line of Metals, and that 
will "ive CD, the Length of the Diameter fought. If, inftead of Balls, fimilar Solids of 
feveral Sides had been propofed, make the fame Operation, as before, for finding each of 
their homologous Sides, in order to have the Lengths, Breadths, and ThicknelTes of the Bo- 
dies to be made. 

USE II. To find the Proportion that each of (he fix Metals have to one another, as to 

their Weight. 

For Example ; It is required to find what Proportion two fimilar and equal Bodies, but of 
different Weights, have to one another. 

Having taken the Diftance from the Center of the Joint of your Sector, to the Point of 
the Character of that Metal of the two propofed Bodies which is lead (and which is always 
more diftant from the Center), apply the faid Diftance acrofs to any two equal Divifions on 
both the Lines of Solids. The Sector remaining thus opened, take the Diftance on the Line 
of Metals, from the Center of the Joint to the Point, denoting the other Metal : and apply- 
in°- it to both Lines of Solids, fee if it will fall upon fome equal Number on each Line; if it 
wUI, that Number, and the other before, will, by permuting them, fhew the Proportions of 
the Metals propofed. 

As, for Example : To find the Proportion of the Weight of a Wedge of Gold, to the 
Weight of a fimilar and equal Wedge of Silver. 

Ivow becaufe Silver weighs lefs than Gold, open the Sector, and having taken the Diftance 
from the Center of the Joint to the Point 5, apply it to the Numbers 50 and 50 on each 
Line of Solids. The Sector remaining thus opened, take the Diftance from the Center to 
the Point O, and applying it on each Line of Solids, and you will find it to fall nearly upon 
the 27th Solid on each Line. Whence I conclude, the Weight of the Gold to the Weight 
of the Silver, Is as 50 to 27 4-, or as 100 to 54 4 ; that is, if the Wedge of Gold weighs 
100 Pounds, the Wedge of Silver will weigh 54 f Pounds, and fo of other Metals, whofe 
Proportions are more exactly laid down by the Numbers of Pounds and Ounces that a cubick 
Foot of each of the Metals weighs, as is expreffed in the Table adjoining to the Proof of the 
Line of Metals. If" nevertheless their Proportions are required in lefTer Numbers, you will 
find, that if a Weclge of Gold weighs 100 Marks, a Wedge of Lead, of the fame Bignefs, 
will weigh about 60 f » one of Silver 54 7, one of Brafs 47 ^, one of Iron 42 T - , and one 
of Tin 39 Marks. 

USE III. Any Body of one of the fix Metals being given ; to find the Weight of any one of 
the five others, which is to be made fimilar and equal to the propofed one. 

For Example ; Let a Ciftern of Tin be propofed, and it is required to make another of Sil- 
ver equal and fimilar to it. Firft weigh the Tin-Ciftern, which fuppofe 36 Pounds. This 
being done, optn the Sector, and having taken the Diftance from the Center of the Sector to 
the Point ]) (which is the Metal the new Ciftern is to be made of), apply that Diftance to 36 
and 36 on each Line of Solids. Then take the Diftance, upon the Line of Metals, of the 
Point n, from the Center; and applying that Diftance crofs-wife on each of the Lines of 
Solids, you will find it nearly fall upon 50 and 50 on each Line: Whence the Weight of a 
Silver Ciftern muft be 50 '- Pounds, to be equal in Bignefs to the Tin-Ciftern. The Proof of 
this Operation may be had by Calculation, viz. in multiplying the different Weights reci- 
procally by thofe of a Cubic Foot of each of the Metals. As, in this Example ; multiplying 
720 lib. 12 Ounces, which is the Weight of a Cubick Foot of Silver, by 36 lib. which is the 
Weight of the Tin- Ciftern; and again, multiplying 516 lib. 2 Ounces, which is the Weight 
of a Cubick Foot of Tin, by 50 -■ Pounds, which is the Weight of the Silver Ciftern, the 
two Products ought to be equal. 

USE IV. The Diameters, or Sides, of two fimilar Bodies of different Metals, being 
given ; to find the Ratio of their Weights. 

Let, for Example, the Diameter of a Ball of Tin be the right Line EF, and the Line Fig. 19. 
G H the Diameter of a Ball of Silver ; it is required to find the Ratio of the Weights of 
thefe two Balls. Open the Sector, and taking the Diameter E F between your CompafTes, 
apply it to the Points U on each Line of Metals. The Sector remaining thus opened, take 
tne Diftance of the Points » on each Leg of the Sector ; which compare with the Diameter 
G H, in order to fee whether it is equal to it : for if it be, the two Balls muft be of the 
fame Weight. But if the Diameter of the Ball of Silver be lefTer than the Diftance of the 
Points D, on each Leg of the Sector, as here K L is, it is manifeft that the Ball of Silver 
weighs lefs than the Ball of Tin ; and to know how much, the Diameters GHandGL 
muft be compared together. Wherefore apply the Diftance of the Points D , which is G H, 

S on 



66 The ConfiruBion and Ufes Book II. 

on each Leg of the Sector, to fome equal Number on both the Lines of Solids ; as, for Exam- 
ple, to the Numbers 60 and 60 •■&gt; then note upon what equal Number, on both Lines of So- 
lids, the Diameter K L falls, which fuppofe 20 : whence the Ball of Silver, whofe Diameter 
is K L, weighs but -J of the Weight of the Ball of Tin, whofe Diameter is EF. 

USE V. The Weight and Diameter of a Ball, or the Side of any other Body, of one of the fix 
Metals, heing given : to find the Diameter or homologous Side of another fimilar Body of one of 
the other five Metals, which Jhall have a given Weight. 

Fig. 20. Let, for Example, the right Line M N be the Diameter of a Ball of Brafs, weighing 10 

Pounds •, and the Diameter of a Ball of Gold is required weighing 15 Pounds. You muft 
firft find the Diameter of a Ball of Gold, weighing as much as that of Silver, and then aug- 
ment it by means of the Line of Solids. To do which, open the Sector, fo that the Diftance 
between the Points ?, on each Line of Metals, be equal to MN. The Sector remaining 
thus opened, take the Diftance of the Points O and G on each Line of Metals, which fup- 
pofe to be the Diameter of the Ball of Gold O P; then open the Sector again, and apply this 
Diftance to 10 and 10 of the Line of Solids, on each Leg of the Sector : The Sector remain- 
ing thus opened, take the Diftance from 15 to 15, on each Line of Solids, and this laft Ex- 
tent QJt will be the Diameter of a Ball of Gold weighing 15 Pounds. 



Of the Conftru&amp;ion and Ufes of the English 

SECTOR. 



TH E principal Lines that are now generally put upon this Inftrument, to be ufed 
Sector-wife, are the Line of Equal Parts, the Line of Chords, the Line of Sines, 
the Line of Tangents, the Line of Secants, and the Line of Polygons. 
Plate 6. The Line of equal Parts, called alfo the Line of Lines, is a Line divided into 100 equal 

Parts ; and if the Length of the Legs of the Sector is fufficient, it is again fubdivided into 
Halfs and Quarters : they are placed on each Leg of the Sector, on the fame Side, and are 
numbered by 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. to 10, which is very near the End of each Leg. Thefe Lines 
are denoted by the Letter L ; it is divided into the fame Number of equal Parts, as the fame 
Line on the Sector defcribed by our Author. And here note, that this 1 may be taken for 
10, or for 100, 1000, 1 0000, &amp;c. as Occafion requires ; and then 2 will fignify 20, 200, 
2000, 20000, &amp;c. and fo of the reft. 

The Line of Chords is a Line divided after the ufual way of the Line of Chords, From a 
Circle, whofe Radius is nearly equal in Length to the Legs of the Sector, beginning at the 
Center, and running towards the End thereof. It is numbered with 10, 20, &amp;c. to 60, and 
to this Line, on each Leg, is placed the Letter C. 

The Line of Sines is a Line of natural Sines, divided from a Circle of the fame Radius, 
as the Line of Chords on the Sector was ; thefe are alfo placed upon each Leg of the Sector, 
and numbered with the Figures 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. to 90 ; at the End of which, on each Leg, 
is fet the Letter S. 

The Line of Tangents, is a Line of natural Tangents, divided from a Circle, and is 
placed upon each Leg of the Sector, and runs to 45 Degrees. It has the Numbers 10, 20, 
&amp;V. to 45 placed upon it, with the Letter T for Tangent. 

There is likewife another fmall Line of Tangents, divided from a Radius, of about two 
Inches, and is placed upon each Leg of the Sector ; it begins at 45, which ftands at the 
Length of the Radius from the Center, and runs to about 75 Degrees or farther, having the 
Numbers 45, 50, &amp;c. to 75, with the Letter t fet thereto. The Ufe of this Line (as here- 
after fhall be fhewn) is to fupply the Defect in the great Line. 

The Line of Secants is only a Line of natural Secants, divided from a Circle of about two 
Inches Radius. Thefe are placed upon each Leg of the Sector, beginning, not from the 
Center, but at two Inches Diftance therefrom, and run to 75 Degrees. To thefe are fet the 
Numbers 10, 20, &amp;c. to J$, with the Letter S at the End thereof for Secants. 

Finally, the Line of Polygons, denoted by the Letter P on each Leg of the Sector, is di- 
vided in the fame manner as the Line of Polygons on the French Sector ; only there the Num- 
ber 3, for an equilateral Triangle, is the firft Polygon, and here the Number 4 for a Square. 

Thefe are the principal Lines that are now put upon this Sector, to be ufed Sector-wife. 

The other Lines, that are placed near and parallel to the outward Edges of the Sector, on 
both Faces thereof, and which are to be ufed, as on Gunter's Scale, are, 

1/?, The Line of artificial Sines, numbered (as per Fig.) with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, on one of the 
Legs, and with 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. to 90, on the other Leg •, which laft Numbers, as they appear 
in the Figure, muft be fet backwards •, to the End, that when the Sector is quite opened, they 
may become forwards. This Line is denoted bv the Letter S, fignifying Sines.

2&lt;#y, The Line of artificial Tangents, placed next below the Line of artificial Siries is 
numbered, on one Leg, i, 2, 3, 4, 5, and on the other 6, 7, 8, &amp;?c. to 45. which laft are 
likewife fet backwards ; but the Numbers 80, yo&gt; 60, 50, placed at theDivifions 10, 20, 30* 
40, which fignify their Complements, are fet forwards. 

Sdfyy Near the Edges, on the other Face of the Sector, is a Foot divided into 12 Inches* 
numbered 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. and each Inch into 20 equal Parts. There is fet to it In. fignifying 
Inches. 

4 //;/y, and Laftfy, Next to that is placed Gunter's Line of Numbers, denoted by the Lettef 
N, as per Figure. 

There are alio fome other Lines placed fometimes upon the vacant Spaces of the Sector* 
as the Lines of Hours, Latitudes, and Inclinations of Meridians ; which are no otherwife 
ufed than if they were placed upon common Scales. 

All the aforefaid Lines, except the fmall Lines of Tangents, Secants, and the Line of Po- 
lygons, are furnifhed with Parallels, and the Divifions marked by unequal Lines, that the 
Lye may the better diflinguifh them. 

SECTION I. 

Of the general USE and Foundation of the Sector. 

The Excellency of this Inftrument above the common Scales, or Rules, is, that it may be 
made to fit all Scales and Radius's ; for by the Sector you may divide a Line, not exceeding 
it's L&lt; ngth when quite opened, into any Number of equal Parts ; alfo from the Line of Chords, 
Sines, i angents, &amp;c. placed on the Sector, as before directed, you may have a Line cf Chords, 
Sines, Tangents, tic. to any Radius, betwixt the Breadth and Length of the Sector when 
opened •, by which Contrivance a Sector is made almoft an univerfal Inftrument. The Inven- 
ts 1 and Contrivance of this Inftrument arofe from a premeditate Confideration of Prop. IV. 
Lib. 6. Eucl. where it is demonftrated that fimilar Triangles have their homologous Sides 
proportional. 

For let the Lines A B, A C, reprefent the Legs of the Sector; and AD, AE, two equal Plate 1 
Sedtions from the Center : then, I fay, if the Points C, B, alfo D, E, are joined, the Lines C B, F ie z\ 
DE, per Prop. II. Lib. 6. Eucl. will be parallel ; therefore becaufe the Lines D E, CB, are 
parallel, the Triangles A D E, A C B, per Scbol Prop. IV. Lib. 6. Eucl. will be fimilar; and 
confequently from the fa.d Prop. IV. the Sides A D, D E, A B, B C, are proportional : that is, 
As D A S v° °,^ S °/ S ,^ B t0 BC ' whence if A D be the half, or a third part of the Side 
AB, D E will be a half, or a third part of the Parallel CB; the like Reafon holds of all 
other Sect.ons : whence you fee that if A D be the Chord, Sine, or Tangent of any Number 
of Degrees, to the Radius AB, DE will be the Chord, Sine, or Tangent of the fame Num* 
ber ot Degrees to the Radius B C. 

Now the Lines found out by the Sector, are of two Sorts, viz. Lateral, or Parallel : Lateral 
are fuch as are found upon the Sides of the Sector, as A B, A C : Parallel are the Lines that 
run from one Leg of the Sector to the other, in equal Divifions from the Center, as D E, C B. 
_ And here note, that the innerrnoft of the Parallels, is the true divided Line, and therefore 
in ufing the CompafTcs, you muft fet them upon the innerrnoft Line, both in lateral and pa- 
rallel Lntrance. r 

And further note, that the Lines are placed upon this Sector, different from thofe that are 
placed upon Sectors formerly made; for inftead of putting the fame Lines at equal Diftances 
from the mward Edges of both the Legs of the Sector, they are put at unequal Diftances, as 
may be fee n m theLigure: where, upon one Leg the Line of Chords is innerrnoft, upon the 
other the Line of Tangents is innerrnoft; that is, the innerrnoft Line of Chords and Tangents 

nrnr qU l^h r a "VT t\ r"^ Edge ' and f ° are the outermoft Line of Chords and Tan- 
gents The Benefit of the Contrivance is this, When you have fet the Sector to a Radius for 

tw x?6c &gt; and \ flu r°K f ° r , the S ' neS f nd T / ngentS With0ut ftirrin S " I ^ the Parallel be- 
1 eoual X\&amp; ? f r hc £ ho r rd \ 9° and 1 90 of the Sines, alfo 45 and* 45 of the Tangents, are 
all equal, which is the Reafon that the Chords run but to 60 Degrees/

mcues, be uquiitd : take that three Inches, and make it a Parallel between 60 and 60 on the 

Line 



6 8 The Conflruclion and Ufes B o o k 1 1 . 

Line of Chords, then, as I have already faid, the fame Extent will reach from 45 to 45, on 
the Line of Tangents ; alfo on the other Side of the Sector, the fame Diftance of three Inches, 
•will reach from 90 to 90 on the Line of Sines : fo that if the Lines of Chords be fet to any 
Radius, the Lines of Sines and Tangents are alfo fet to the fame. Now the Sector being 
thus opened, if you take the parallel Diftance between 10 and 10 on the Line of Chords, it 
■will give the Chord of 10 Degrees. Alfo if you take the parallel Diftance on the Line of Sines 
between 10 and 10, you will have the Sine of 10 Degrees. Laftly, if you take the parallel 
Extent on the Line of Tangents, between 10 and 10, it will give you the Tangent of 10 
Degrees. 

If the Chord, or Tangent of 70 Degrees, had been required ; then for the Chord you muft 
take the parallel Diftance of half the Arc propofed, that is, the Chord of 35 Degrees, and 
repeat that Diftance twice on the Arc you lay it down on, and you will have the Chord of 70 
Degrees ; and for finding the Tangent of 70 Degrees to the aforefaid Radius, you muft make 
ufe of the fmall Line of Tangents : for the great one running but to 45 Degrees, the Parallel 
of 70 cannot be taken on that, therefore take the Radius of three Inches, and make it a Pa- 
rallel between 45 and 45 on the fmall Line of Tangents •, and then the parallel Extent of 70 
Degrees on the faid Line, is the 7'angent of 70 Degrees to 3 Inches Radius. 

If you would have the Secant of any Arc, then take the given Radius, and make it a Pa- 
rallel between the Beginning of the Line of Secants, that is o and o ; fo the parallel Diftance 
between 10 and 10, or 70 and 70, on the faid fecantLine, will give you the Secant of 10, 
or 70 Degrees, to the Radius of three Inches. 

After this manner may the Chord, Sine, or Tangent of any Arc be found, provided the 
Radius can be made a Parallel between 60 and 60 on the Line of Chords, or between the 
fmall Tangent of 45, or Secant of o Degrees. But if the Radius be fo large, that it cannot 
be made a Parallel between 45 and 45 on the fmall Line of Tangents, then there cannot be 
found a Tangent of any Arc above 45 Degrees, nor the Secant of no Arc at all to fuch a 
Radius, becaufe all Secants are greater than the Radius, or Semi-diameter of a Circle. 

If the Converfe of any of thefe things be required •, that is, if the Radius be fought, to 
which a given Line is the Chord, Sine, Tangent, or Secant of any Arc, fuppofe of 10 De- 
grees ; then it is but making that Line (if it be a Chord) a Parallel on the Line of Chords 
between 10 and 10, and the Sector will ftand at the Radius required j that is, the parallel 
Extent between 60 and 60, on the faid Chord-Line, is the Radius. 

And fo if it be a Sine, Tangent, or Secant, it is but making it a Parallel between the 
Sine, Tangent, or Secant of 10 Degrees, according as it is given ; then will the Diftance of 
90 and 90 on the Sines, if it be a Tangent, the Extent from 45 to 45 on the Tangents, and 
if it be a Secant, the Extent or Diftance between o and o, be the Radius. 

Hence, you fee, it is very eafy to find the Chord, Sine, Tangent, or Secant to any Radius.

Proportional between G E, and EF, will be equal to half the Side of the Polygon fought, 
which doubled, will give the whole Side. Now having found the Length of the whole Side, 
you muft, upon the Line exprefling it's Length, make a Pentagon (as directed by our Author

the Line of Lines (as directed by our Author in the Uk of the Line of equal Parts), then EP, 
which is 12.4 of thofe Parts, will be the Side of the Square fought. 
Note, 12.4 is the fquare Root of 1 1 x 14. 

USE III. A Square being given, to find the Diameter of a Circle equal to it. 

Fig. 27. Let A B be one Side of the given Square, which divide into 1 1 equal Parts, by means of 

the Line of Lines on the Sector; then continue the faid Side, fo that AG may be 12.4; that 
is, 1.4 of thofe Parts more, and the Line A G, will be the Diameter of a Circle, equal to the 
Square whofe Side is A B. 

USE IV. 'The tranfverfe and conjugate Diameters of an Ellipfis being given, to find the 

Side of a Square equal to it. 

Fig. 28. Let AB, and CD, be the tranfverfe and conjugate Diameters of an Ellipfis: firft, find a 

mean Proportional between the tranfverfe and conjugate Diameters, which let be the Line

Fig. 29. Let the given Proportion that the tranfverfe and conjugate Diameters are to have, be as 

2 to 1 ; then divide the Side A B of the given Square, into 1 1 equal Parts. Now as 2 is to 
1 (the Terms of the given Proportion), So is 1 1 x 14 = 154 to a fourth Number ; the fquare 
Root of which being extracted, will be a Number to which, if the Line AG is taken equal 
(fuppofing one of thofe 1 1 Parts the Side of the Square is divided into, to be Unity), the faid 
Line A G, will be the conjugate Diameter fought. Then to find the tranfverfe Diameter, 
fay, As i is to 2, So is the conjugate Diameter AG, to the tranfverfe Diameter fought. 
To work the firft of the faid Proportions by the Line of Lines on the Sector, fet 1 over as a 
Parallel on 2 ; then the parallel Extent of 154 taken, and laterally meafured on the Line of 
Lines, will give 77, the fourth Proportional fought. In the fame manner may the latter 
Proportion be worked. 

USE VI. To defcribe an Ellipfis, by having the tranfverfe and conjugate Diameters given. 

Fig. 30. Let A B, and E D, be the given Diameters : take the Extent AC, or C B, between your 

CompafTes, and to that Extent, open the Legs of the Sector fo, that the Diftance between 
90 and 90 of the Line of Sines, may be equal to it : then may the Line A C be divided into 
a Line of Sines, by taking the parallel Extents of the Sine of each Degree, on the Legs of the 
Sector, between your CompafTes, and laying them off" from the Center C ; the Line A C be- 
ing divided into a Line of Sines (I have only divided it into the Sine of every 10 Degrees) 
from every of them raife Perpendiculars both ways. Now to find Points in the faid Perpen- 
diculars, through which the Ellipfis muft pafs, take the Extent of the femi- conjugate Diameter 
C E, between your CompafTes; and then open the Sector fo, that the Points of 90 and 90, 
on the Lines of Sines of the Sector, may be at that Diftance from each other. This being 
done, take the parallel Sines of each Degree, of the Lines of Sines of the Sector, and lay 
them off, on thofe Perpendiculars drawn thro' their Complements, in the Line of Sines A C, 
both ways from the faid Line A C, and you will have two Points in each of the Perpendicu- 
lars thro' which the Ellipfis muft pafs. 

As for Example, the Sector always remaining at the fame Opening, take the Diftance from 
80 to 80, on the Line of Sines, between your CompafTes, and letting one'Foot in the Point 
10, on the Line AC ; with the other make the Points a and b, in the Perpendicular patting 
thro' that Point: then the Points a and b, will be the two Points in the faid Perpendicular, 
thro' which the Ellipfis muft pafs. All the other Points, in this manner, being found, if they 
are joined by an even Hand, there will be defcribed the Semi Ellipfis DAE. In the fame 
manner may the other half of the Ellipfis be defcribed.

1 laving drawn the Triangle EFG fimilar to A B C, divide the Side E G in the Point H; Fig. 3 a. 
Co th it EH may be to H G, as A D is to D C; which may be done by taking the Sum of 
the l'iivs A I) and DC between your CompafTes, and fetting that Extent over as a Parallel 
on the I ine of Lines of the Sector, upon the Side EG of the Triangle, laterally taken ori 
the Line of Lines ; for then the parallel Extent of A D will give the Length of E H, and 
ronlVquently the Point H will be had. ,..,,,.., , t^ t l tt? 

Jn like manner muft the Side EF (or F G) be divided fo in I, that E I may be to I F, as

the lame Proportion to each, other, as the Lines AD, B D, DC. Now if the Lines EO, 
h (), and G O are equal to the given Lines AD, BD, DC, the Diftances E F, FG, and 
Eg! will be the Diftances of the Towers fought. But if E O, OF, OG are lefTer than 
A D, D B, D C, continue them out fo, that P O, OR, and O O be equal to them ; then 
the Points P, Q^, R being joined, the Diftances PR, R Cv, and P Q^will be the Diftances 
of the Towers fought. Laftly, If the Lines E O, OF, O G, are greater than AD, D B, 
D C, cut off from them Lines equal to A D, BD, D C, and join the Points of Section by 
three right Lines ; then the Diftances of the faid three right Lines, will be the fought Di- 
ftances of the three Towers. 

Note, If E H be equal to H G, or E I to I F, the Centers L and N, of the Circles, will 
be infinitely diftant from II and I ; that is, in the Points H and I there muft be two Perpen- 
diculars raifed to the Sides E F, EG, inftead of two Circles, 'till they interfect each other : 
But if E II be lefTer than H G, the Center L will fall on the other Side of the Bafe EG 
continued •, underftand the fame of" EI, IF. 

USE VIII. To projeil the Sphere Orthographic ally upon the Plane of the Meridian. 
Let the Radius of the Meridian Circle, upon which the Sphere is to be projected, be A E i Plate %'* 
then divide the Circumference of the faid Circle into four equal Parts in E, P, JE, S, and F - u 
draw the Diameters E^i, PS; the former of which will reprefent the Equator, and the lat- 
ter PS, the Hour-Circle of 6, as alfo the Axis of the World ; P being the North-Pole, and 
S the South-Pole. Then muft each Quarter of the Meridian be divided into 90 Degrees, by 
making the Extent from 60 to 60 of the Line of Chords, on the Sector, equal to the Ra- 
dius of the Meridian Circle •, and taking the parallel Extent of every Degree, and laying 
them off from the Equator towards the Poles ; in which if 23 Deg. 30 Min. be numbered, 
(viz. the Sun's greateft Declination) from E to 2b Northwards, and from JE to Yf South- 
wards, the Line drawn from 25 to Yf will be the Ecliptick, and f he Lines drawn Parallel to 
the Equator, through 2* and Yf t will be the Tropicks. 

Now if each Semidiameter of the Ecliptick be divided into Lines of Sines (by making the 
Diftance of the Points of 90 and 90, on the Line of Sines of the Sector, equal to either of 
theSemidiamcters, and taking out the parallel Extent of each Degree, and laying them off both 
ways from the Center A), the firft 30 Degrees, from A towards 25, will ftand for the Sign 
Aries ; the 30 Degrees next following for Taurus ; the reft for n, ss, Sl,'&amp;c. in their Order. 

If, again, A P, AS, are divided into Lines of Sines, and have the Numbers 10, 20, 30, 
Isc. to 90 fet to them, the Lines drawn thro' each of thefe Degrees, parallel to the Equator, 
will reprefent the Parallels of Latitude, and fhew the Sun's Declination. 

If, moreover, A E, A JE are divided into Lines of Sines, and alfo the Parallels, and then 
there is a Line carefully drawn thro' each 15 Degrees; the Lines fo drawn will be Elliptical, 
and will reprefent the Hour-Circles ; the Meridian P E S the Hour of 12 at Noon ; that next 
to it, drawn thro' y$ Degrees from the Center, the Hours of 1 1 and 1 -, that which is drawn 
thro' 60 Degrees from the Center, the Hours of 10 and 2, &amp;V. 

Then with refptct to the Latitude, you may number it from E, Northwards, towards Z, 
and there place the Zenith (that is, make the Arc EZ 51 Deg. 32 Min. for London) ; thro' 
which, and the Center, the Line Z A N being drawn, will reprefent the vertical Circle paf- 
fing thro' the Zenith and Nadir Eaft and Weft ; and the Line M A H, crofting it at righr 
Angles, will reprefent th*e Horizon. Thefe two being divided, like the Ecliptick and Equa- 
tor, the Lines drawn thro' each Degree of the Radius A Z, parallel to the Horizon, will re- 
prefent the Circles of Altitude, and the Divifions in the Horizon, and it's Parallels will give 
the Azimuths, which will be Ellipfes. 

Laftly, If thro' 18 Degrees in A N, be drawn a right Line I K, parallel to the Horizon, 
it will fhow the Time of Day-breaking, and the End of Twilight. For an Example of this 
Projection, let the Place of the Sun be the laft Degree of « , the Parallel pafftng thro' this 
Place is L D, and therefore the Meridian Altitude will be M L ; the Depreffion below the 

Horizon 



72 The Conflruciion and Ufes Book II. 

Horizon at Midnight H D •, the femidiurnal Arc L C; the feminocturnal Arc CD •, the De- 
clination Ab ; the afcenfional Difference b C ; the Amplitude of Afcenfion A C: The Dif- 
ference between the End of Twilight, and the Break of Day, is very fmall •, for the Sun's 
Parallel hardly croffes the Line ot Twilight. 

If the Sun's Altitude be given, let a Line be drawn for it parallel to the Horizon ; fo ic 
fhall crofs the Parallel of the Sun, and there fhew both the Azimuth and the Hour of the Day. 
As fuppofe the Place of the Sun being given, as before, the Altitude in the Morning was 
found, 20 Degrees, the Line F G, drawn parallel to the Horizon thro' 20 Degrees in AZ, 
would crofs the Parallel of the Sun in O ; wherefore F O fhews the Azimuth, and L O the 
Quantity of the Hour from the Meridian, which is about half an Hour pad 6 in the Morn- 
ing, and about half a Point from the Eaft. The Diftance of two Places may be alfo fhewn 
by this Projection, in having their Latitudes and Difference of Longitude given. 

For fuppofe a Place in the Eaft of Arabia hath 20 Degrees of North Latitude, whofe Dif- 
ference of Longitude from London, by an Eclipfe, is found to be five Hours and an half: Let 
Z be the Zenith of London, and the Parallel of Latitude for that other Place be L D, in which 
the Difference of Longitude isLO; wherefore O reprefenting the Pofition of that Place, 
draw thro' O a Parallel to the Horizon M H, croffig the vertical A Z about 70 Degrees from 
the Zenith ; which multiplied by 69, the Number of Miles in a Degree, gives 4830 Miles, 
the Diftance of that Place from London. 

USE IX. To projeel the Sphere Stereograpbically upon the Plane of the Horizon ; fuppofe 1 
for the Latitude of 5 1 Degrees, 3 2 Minutes. 

jr,-g z Draw a Circle of any Magnitude at pleafure, as N E, S W, reprefenting the Horizon •, in 

which draw the two Diameters, WE, N S, eroding one another at right Angles, which will 
be the Reprefentations of two great Circles of the Sphere crolTing each other at right Angles 
in the Zenith. Let N reprefent the North, E the Eaft, S the South, and W the Weft Part 
of the Horizon. 

Note, In all thefe Projections, the Eye is commonly fuppofed to be in the Under-pole of 
the primitive Circle, projecting that Hemifphere which is oppofed to the Eye, which will all 
fall within the primitive Circle-, but that Hemifphere in which the Eye is, will all fall without 
the primitive Circle, and will run out in an infinite annular Plane, in the Plane of the Pro- 
jection, and confequently cannot all of it be projected by Scale and Compafs. 

I. But now let us begin with projecting the Equinoctial. And here we mult firft deter- 
mine the Line of Meafures, in which the Center of this Circle will be ; and this will be done 
by determining in what Points a Plane, perpendicular to the primitive Circle, will cut the 
Horizon, whether in the North and South, Eaft and Weft, or in what other intermediate 
Points fuch a Plane fhall cut it. The Pole of the World, in this Projection, is elevated 51 
Deg. 32 Min. and confequently the Equinoctial, on the Northern Part of the Horizon, will 
fall below the Horizon, and it is the Southern Part which here mult be projected, or which 
will fall within the primitive Circle ; that Plane, whofe Interfection with the Horizon fhall 
produce the Line of Meafures, will be the Plane of a Meridian palling thro' the North and 
South Parts of the Horizon : "wherefore N S will be the Line of Meafures, in which the Center 
of the projected Equinoctial mult fall •, and fince it is the Southern Part of the Equinoctial 
which we are to project, it's Center will be towards the North. 

To find whereabouts in the Line of Meafures the faid Center will fall, you muft firft open 
the Legs of the Sector, fo that the Diftance from 45 Degrees to 45 Degrees, on the Lines of 
Tangents, is equal to the Radius of the primitive Circle ; then take the parallel Extent of 
the Tangents of 38 Deg. 28 Min. the Height of the Equinoctial above the Plane of the Ho- 
rizon, and lay it off from Z to n, and ;/ will be the Center of the projected Equinoctial ; and 
the Secant of the fame, 38 Deg. 30 Min. will give it's Radius, with which the Circle WQJS 
muft be defcribed, which is the Reprefentation of that part of the Equinoctial which is above 
our Horizon, for the Latitude of 51 Deg. 32 Min. 

II. We will next project the Ecliptick, which being a great Circle of the Sphere, muft cut 
the Equinoctial at a Diameter's Diftance ; that is, in E, W, the Eaft and Weft Points of the 
Horizon, and confequently will have the fame Line of Meafures with that of the Equinoctial, 
viz. N S. Now let us confider whether the Center of the Ecliptick falls towards the North, 
or towards the South of the Horizon ; and this will eafily be determined, by confidering that 
the Equinoctial is elevated above the Southern Part of the Horizon 38 Deg. 28 Min. and 
the Northern Part of the Ecliptick, or the Northern Signs, are elevated above the Equinoc- 
tial 23 Deg. 30 Min. which in all, make 62 Degrees, which is leffer than 90 Deg. So that 
it muft fall towards the South, and confequently the Center muft be Northwards, and will 
be found (the Sector remaining open as before), by fetting off the Tangent of 62 Deg. from 
z to b, and the Secant of 62 Deg. will give it's Radius ; with which the Circle W C E, the 
Reprefentation of the Northern half of the Ecliptick, muft be defcribed. 

The Southern Part of the Ecliptick is likewife, for the moft part, projected on the hori- 
zontal Projection, and made to fall within the primitive Circle ; but this cannot be, the Globe 
remaining fixed: for that part of the Ecliptick, which is below the Horizon, will be thrown 
out of the primitive Circle •, fo that it cannot be projected, unlefs the Globe be fuppofed to

be turned round, and by that means the Southern Part of the Ecliptick to be brought above 
the Horizon •, but fuch a Revolution of the Sphere, where it makes any Alteration, is fcarce 
allowable: however, I mail (hew how it is uibally projected. 

The fame Line of Meafures N S remains ftill, and the Circle muft fall to the South, and 
confcquently it's Center to the North of the Horizon ; therefore nothing remains but to find 
it's Elevation above the Horizon. The Northern Part of the Ecliptick falls 23 Deg. 30 Min. 
nearer the Zenith than the Equinoctial does ; therefore the Southern Part, being brought a- 
bove the Horizon, muft be 23 Deg. 30 Min. nearer the Horizon than the Equinoctial : So 
that 23 Deg. ^o Min. being taken from 38 Deg. 28 Min. there remains 15 Deg. for the 
Di franco of that part of the Ecliptick above the Horizon. It will be reprefented by W e E, 
which is defcribed by fetting off the Tangent of 15 Degrees for the Center, and taking the 
Secant of the fame for the Radius. 

III. NS produced will alfb be the Line of Meafures for all Parallels of Declination, and 
Parallels of Latitude : for the Poles of leiTer Circles being the fame as thofe of the great Cir- 
cles, to which they are parallel, it is manifeft that the lame Plane, which is at right Angles 
to the Equinoctial and Horizon, will alfo be at right Angles to all leiTer Circles parallel to 
the Equinoctial, and the fame will hold as to Circles parallel to the Ecliptick : But N S is 
the Line of Meafures of the Equinoctial and Ecliptick, and confequently muft be the Line of 
Meafures of all Circles parallel to either of them; therefore the Centers of fuch leiTer Circles 
will be in N S produced, if there be Occafion. Now to project them, for Inftance, the 
Tropick of Cancer ; confider, in this Pofition of the Sphere, what will be it's neareft and 
greateft Diftance from the Zenith, or the Pole of the primitive Circle, which you will find 
to be 28 Degrees ; for the Equinoctial being elevated 38 Deg. 28 Min. above the Horizon, 
and the Tropick of Cancer being 23 Deg. 30 Min. from the Equinodial, which, being added 
together, gives 62 Deg. which fubftracted from 90 Deg. leaves 28 Deg. it'sDiftance from the 
Zenith on the South-fide of the Horizon •, therefore the Half- Tangent of 28 Deg. or the Tan- 
gent of i4Deg. fet from Z to C, will give one Extremity of it's°projected Diameter: Then 
the Diftance from the Zenith to the Pole, being 38 Deg. 28 Min. and from the Pole to the 
Tropick of Cancer 66 Deg. 30 Min. the Sum of thefe, viz. 104 Deg. 58 Min. will be it's 
grcateft 1 hftance from the Zenith •, the Half- Tangent of which, fet from Z to a, will give the 
other Extremity of it's projected Diameter : therefore having got C a the Diameter, bifect it, 
and defenbe the Circle « C 2?. 

The Tropick of Capricorn may be defcribed in the fame manner : for the Diftance of the 
Equinoctial and the Zenith being 51 Deg. 32 Min. if to this be added 23 Deg. 30 Min. you 
will have 55 Deg. 2 Min. equal to the neareft Diftance of the Tropick of Capricorn, on the 
South-lice of the Horizon ; the Half- Tangent of which being fet from Z to*, will give one 
Extremity of it s Diameter. Then the D.ftance between the Zenith and the Pole, viz. 38 
Deg. 28 Mm and the Diftance between the Pole and the Equinoctial, which is 00 Deg. and 
the D.ftance between the Equinoctial and the Tropick of Capricorn^ which is 23 Deg. 30 
Mm. being all added together, will give the greateft Diftance of the Tropick of Capricorn, 
Irani the Zenith, viz 152 Deg. 2 M.n. the Semi-tangent of which being fet from Z towards 
the North will give the other Extremity of the Diameter. Bifed the Diameter found in e&lt; 
and defenbe the Circle * C tf, which is the Reprefentation of fo much of the Tropick of 
Capricorn, as talis within the primitive Circle.

yond the Zenith •, therefore 75 Deg. 2 Min. taken from 9 o Deg. leaves 15 Deg. which is the 
neareft D.ftance of the Polar Circle from the Zenith : And the^Half-Tangent^f 15 Dei fet

oF the Pole, viz. 51 Deg. 32 Min. then take the Tangent of 51 Deg. 32 Min. and fet it 
from Z to K •, and upon the Center K, and with the Secant of" the fame Elevation, defcribe 
WPE, which is the Circle required. 

The Point P, where N S, WE, interfect one another, is the Reprefentation of the Pole 
of the World •, forNS being the Reprefentation of the Hour-Circle of 12, the projected 
Pole muft be fomewhere in this Line -, but it mult be fome where in W E, which is likewife 
the Projection of an Hour-Circle : therefore it muft be in that Point where thefe two pro- 
jected Circles interfect one another, that is, in the Point P -, P is the Point thro' which all the 
Hour-Circles muft pafs in the Projection. 

In order to draw the reft of the Hour-Circles, we muft have recourfe to a Secondary Line 
oF Meafures, which may thus be determined : To P K, at the Point K, erect D B at right 
Angles, and produce the Circle WPE, 'till it meet the Line DB, in the Points D and 13 ; 
and the Line D B will be the fecondary Line of Meafures in which the Centers of all the 
Hour-Circles will be found-, for let the Hour-Circle of 6, D PB, be confidered as the pri- 
mitive Circle, in whofe Under-Pole (which will be in the Equinoctial) K, let the Eye be 
placed ; then DB will be the Reprefentation of the Equinoctial, for it palTing thro' the Eye 
will be projected into a right Line : but the Equinoctial is at right Angles to the Hour-Circles, 
both the primitive and all the reft-, therefore it will be the fecondary Line of Meafures, upon 
this Suppofition, upon which will be all their Centers. In order to find which, fet the Sector 
to the Radius P K, then take off parallel-wife the Tangents of 1 5 Deg. 30 Deg. 45 Deg. the 
Elevations of the Hour-Circles above the Hour-Circle at 6, and fet them both ways, from K 
to r, from K to/, from K to r, &amp;c. then upon thofe Centers, and with the Secants of the 
fame Elevations, defcribe the Circles P P, PQ^, and P T, which will be the Hour-Circles ; 
for they are all great Circles of the Sphere, paffing thro' the Pole P, and make Angles with 
one another of 15 Deg. or are 15 Deg. diftant from each other: and the Portions of thofe Cir- 
cles which fall within the primitive Circle NESW, as HPi&gt;, are the Reprefentations of 
thofe Halves of the Hour-Circle, which are above our Horizon in our Latitude. 

VI. In like manner the Circles of Longitude may be drawn, by determining the fecondary 
Line of Meafures R S, in which all their Centers will be; and this Line will be determined 
after the fame manner with D B above, and the Circles of Longitude drawn as before the 
Meridians were drawn : for the Line N S will be the Line of Meafures, with refpect to one 
of them palling thro' E and W, the Eaft and Weft Points of the Horizon. In order to draw 
this Circle, confider it's Elevation above the Horizon, which will be found by confidering the 
Diftance of the Pole of the Ecliptick, from the Pole of the World, which will be 28 Deg. 
2 Min. the Elevation of this Circle above the Horizon. Set the Tangent of 28 Deg. 2 Min. 
from Z to Q, and with the Secant of the fame Diftance, defcribe the Circle W p E -, to 
p Ck, at the Point Q, erect R S at right Angles, which will be the fecondary Line of Mea- 
fures. In this Line from Q^ (the Sector being fet to p Q_), fet off the Tangents of 24 Deg. 
40 Deg. according to the Number of Circles you have a Defire to draw, from Qjo x, from 
Q^to_v, &amp;c. and with the Secants of 20 Deg. 40 Deg. &amp;c. defcribe the Circles of Longitude, 
MPm, &amp;c. 

VII. The Reprefentations of Azimuths, in this Projection, will be all right Lines, and any 
Number of them may be drawn, making any afllgned Angles with one another, if the Limb 
be divided into it's Degrees by help of the Sector, and thro' thefe Degrees be drawn Diame- 
ters to the primitive Circle. 

VIII. All Parallels of Altitude, in this Projection, will be Circles parallel to the primitive 
Circle, and may be eafily drawn, by dividing a Radius of the primitive Circle, into Half- 
Tangents, and defcribing upon the Center Z, thro' the Points of Divifion, concentrick Cir-? 
cles. I fhall omit drawing of them, left the Scheme be too much perplexed. 

USE X. l io projeel the Sphere Stereographically upon the Plane of the Solflitial Colure 

for the Horizon of 51 Deg. 32 Min. 

fig. 3&gt; Draw the Circle HBOC, reprefenting the primitive Circle; and the Diameter H O, 

reprefenting the Horizon: Set off the Chord of 51 Deg. 32 Min. from O to P, having firft 
fet the Sector to the Radius of the Circle, which will give the Polar Point, and draw the 
Diameter Pp, reprefenting the Hour-Circle of 6. 

I. The Equinoctial may be reprefented, by drawing the Diameter E Q^at right Angles to 
the Diameter Pp. 

II. Set off 23 Deg. 30 Min. from the Chords, from E to 20, and from Qjo kf, which will 
reprefent the Ecliptick. 

III. The Tropicks of Cancer and Capricorn may be drawn thus : Take the Secant of 66 Deg. 
30 Min. the Diftance of each of them from their refpedtive Poles, and fet it both ways, from 
the Center A in P p produced, which will give the two Points e e the Centers of the two Cir- 
cles, and their Radii will be the Tangents of the fame 66 Deg. 30 Min. 

IV. The Polar Circles, as alfo all other Parallels of Declination, may be drawn in the fame 
manner. 

V. The Line of Meafures for the Azimuths will be H O, and the Line of Meafures for the 
Almacanters will be B C.

of the Englifti Se£tor. 73 

VI. sf • V, or the Ecliptick, will be the Line of Meafures for the Circles of Longitude, 
and the Line 'of Meafures for the Circles of Latitude will be N S, all of which may be eafily 
drawn from what is faid in the precedent Ufe. 

VII. The Ecliptick may be divided into it's proper Signs in this Projection, by fetting off 
the Tangents of 15 Deg. 30 Deg. 45 D eg- both ways from A. 

USE XI. To draw the Hour -Lines upon an erett direft South Plane, as alfo on an 

Horizontal Plane. 

Firft, draw the indefinite right Line C C, for the Horizon and Equator, and crofs it at Fig. 4. 
right Angles in the Point A, about the middle of the Line, with the indefinite right Line A B, 
ferving for the Meridian, and the Hour Line of 12. then take out 15 Deg. from the Line of 
Tangents, on the Sector (the Sector being fet to a parallel Radius leffer than the Extent from 
4- Deg. to 45 Deg. of the leffer Lines of Tangents, when the Sector is quite opened), and 
lay them off in the Equator on both Sides from A, and one Point will ferve for the Hour of 
1 j, and the other tor the Hour of 1. Again, Take out the Tangent of 30 Deg. (the Sector 
beino- opened to the fame Radius), and lay it off on both Sides the Point A in the Equator, 
and one of thefe Points will ferve one for the Hour of 10, and the other for the Hour of 2. 
In the fame manner, lay off the Tangent of 45 Deg. for the Hours of 9 and 3, the Tangent of 
60 Deg. for the Hours of 8 and 4, and the Tangent of J5 Deg. for the Hours of 7 and 5; 
But note, becaufe the greater Tangents on the Sector run but to 45 Deg. therefore you muft 
fct the parallel Radius of the leffer Tangents, when you come above 45 Deg. to the Extent 
of the Radii of the greater Tangents. 

Now if you have a mind to fet down the Parts of an Hour, you muft allow 7 Deg. 30 Min. 
for every half Hour, and 3 Deg. 45 Min. for one quarter. This done, you muft confider the 
Latitude of the Place in which the Plane is, which fuppofe 5 1 Deg. 30 Min. then if you take 
the Secant of 5 1 Deg. 32 Min. off from the Sector, it remaining opened to the parallel Radius 
of the leffer Tangents, and fet it off from A to V, this Point V will be the Center of the 
Plane •, and if you draw from V, right Lines to 1 1, 10, 9, &amp;c. and the reft of the Hour Points, 
they will be the required Hour Lines. 

But if it happen, that fome of thefe Hour Points fall out of the Plane, you may thus remedy 
yourfelf, by means of the larger Tangents. 

At the Hour Points of 3 and 9, draw occult Lines parallel to the Meridian ; then the Di- 
ftances D C, between the Hour Line of 6, and the Hour Points of 3 and 9, will be equal to 
the Semi-diameter A V; and if they be divided in the fame manner as the Line AC is di- 
vided, you will have the Points of 4, 5, 7, and 8, with their Halves and Quarters. 

For\take out the Semi-diameter A V, and make it a parallel Radius, by fitting it over in 
the Tangents of 45 and 45 ; then take the parallel Tangent of 15 Deg. and it will give the 
Diftance from 6 to 5, and from 6 to 7. The Sector remaining thus opened, take out the 
parallel Tangent of 30 Deg. and it will give the Diftance from 6 to 4, and from 6 to 8 : the 
like may be done for Halves and Quarters of Hours. 

The Hour Points may be otherwife denoted thus: Having drawn a right Line for the 
Equator, as before, and a (Turned the Point A for the Hour of 12, cut off two equal Lines 
A 10, and A 2, then upon the Diftance between 10 and 2, make an equilateral Triangle* and 
you will have B for the Center of the Equator, and the Line A B, will give the Diftance from 
A to 9, and from A to 3. This done, take out the Diftance between 9 and 3, and this will 
give the Diftance from B to 8, and from 8 to 7, and from 8 to 1 : and again, from B to 4, 
and from 4 to 5, and from 4 to 1 1 ; fo have you the Hour Points : and if you take out the 
Diftances B 1, B 3, B 5, fc&gt;V. the Points may be found not only for the Half-Hours, but for the 
Quarters. 

In the fame manner are the Hour Lines drawn on a Horizontal Plane, only with this Dif- 
ference, that A H is the Secant of the Complement of the Latitude, and the Hour Lines of 
4&gt; 5&gt; 7&gt; 8, are continued thro' the Center. 

USE XII. To draw the Hour Lines upon a Polar Plane, as alfo on a Meridional Plant* 

In a Polar Plane, the Equator may be alfo the fame with the Horizontal Plane, and the Hour Fig. 5. 
Points may be denoted as before, in the laft Ufe : but the Hour Lines muft be drawn parallel 
to the Meridian. r 

In a Meridional Plane, the Equator will make an Angle with the Horizontal Line, equal 
to the Complement of the Latitude of the Place; then may you affume the Point A, and 
t^ere crofs the Equator with a right Line, which will ferve for the Hour Line of 6: then the 
langent ot 15 Deg. be.ng laid off in the Equator on both Sides from 6, will gl*e the Hour 
Points ot 5 and 7 ; and the Tangent of 30 Deg. the Hour Points of 8 and 4 ; the Tangent of 
45 ai&amp;\ the u H ~ UrPomtsof 3 and 9&gt; the Tangent of 60 Deg. the Hour Points of 2 and 10: 
and laltly the Tangent of 75 Deg. will give the Hour Points of 1 and 1 1 ; and if right 
Lines are drawn thro thefe Hour Points, croffing the Equator at right Angles, thefe (hall be 
the Hour Lines required. © 1 &amp; &amp; 

USE 



7 6 ^he ConflruElion and Ufes y &amp;c. Book. II. 

USE XIII. to draw the Hour Lines upon a vertical declining Plane. 

Fig. 6. Firft draw A V the Meridian, and A E the Horizontal Line, crofting one another in the 

Point A ; then take out A V, the Secant of the Latitude of the Place, which fuppoie 5 1 Deg. 
32 Min. and prick it down on the Meridian from A to V. Now becaufe the Plane declines, 
which fuppofe 40 Deg. Eaftward, you muft make an Angle of the Declination upon the Cen- 
ter A, below the Horizontal Line, on the left Side of the Meridian, becaufe the Plane declines 
Eaftwards ; for if it had declined Weftward, the faid Angle muft have been made on the right 
Side of the Meridian. This being done, take AH, the fecant Complement of the Latitude, 
out of the Sector, and prick it down in the Line of Declination from A to H, as was done 
for the Semi-diameter in the Horizontal Plane : then draw an indefinite right Line thro' the 
Point A, perpendicular to A H, which will make an Angle, with the Horizontal Line, equal 
to the Plane's Declination, and will be as the Equator in the Horizontal Plane. Again, take 
the Hour Points out of the Tangents, as in the laft Problem, and prick them down in this 
Equator on both Sides, from the Hour of 12 at A ; then lay your Ruler, and draw right 
Lines thro' the Center H, and each of thefe Hour Points, and you will have all the p]our 
Lines of an Horizontal Plane, except the Hour of 6", which is drawn thro' H perpendicular to 
H A. Laftly, you muft note the Interferons that thefe Hour Lines make with AE, the Ho- 
rizontal Line of the Plane, and then if right Lines are drawn thro' the Center V, and each of 
thefe Interferons, they will be the Hour Lines required. 

The Hour Points may be pricked down otherwife, thus : Take out the Secant of the 
Plane's Declination, and prick it down in the Horizontal Line from A to E, and thro' E draw 
rio-ht Lines parallel to the Meridian, which will cut the former Hour Lines of 3 or 9, in the 
Point C ; then take out the Semi-diameter A V, and prick it down in thofe Parallels from 
C to D, and draw right Lines from A to C, and from V to D ; ■ the Line V D will be the 
Hour of 6: and if you divide thofe Lines AC, DC, in the fame manner as D C is divided 
in the Horizontal Plane, the Hour Points required will be had. 

Or you may find the Point D, in the Hour of 6, without knowing either HorC; for hav- 
ing pricked down A V in the Meridian Line, and A E in the Horizontal Line, and drawn 
Parallels to the Meridian thro' the Points at E, take the Tangent of the Latitude out of the 
Sector, and fit it over in the Sines of 90 Deg. and 90 Deg. and the parallel Sine of the Plane's 
Declination, meafured in the fame Tangent Line, will there mew the Complement of the 
Angle D V A, which the Hour Line of 6 makes with the Meridian : then having the Point D, 
take out the Semi-diameter V A, and prick it down in thofe Parallels from DtoC; fo (hall 
you have the Lines DC, AC, to be divided, as before. 

Thus have you the Ufe of the Sector applied in refolving feveral ufeful Problems. I might 
have laid down many more Problems in all the practical Parts of Mathematicks, wherein this 
Inftrument is ufeful •, but what I, and our Author have faid of this Inftrument, will, I believe, 
be fuffkient to fhew Perfons fkilled in the feveral practical Parts of Mathematicks, the Man- 
ner of ufing this Inftrument therein.

Of the Conftru&amp;ion and Ufe of feveral different Sorts of 
Compares, and other Curious Injlruments. 




CHAP. I. 

Of the Conftruttion and Ufes of feveral Sorts &lt;?/* CompafTes. 

A V I N G already treated of Common CompafTes, ufually put into Cafes" 
of Inftru merits, we proceed now to mention fome others, fometimes like- 
wife placed in Cafes of different Bigneffes. 

The Conjtruftion of Hair-Compaffes. 
Thefe Compares are fo called, becaufe of a Contrivance in the Body of pi atP n 
them, by means of which an Extent may be taken to a hair's Breadth * 1 
We have before hinted, that the Goodnefs of CompafTes confifts chiefly 8 ' A * 
in having the Motion of their Head fufficiently eafy, and that they open and fliut very equally • 
anc I thai : they may do fo, the Joints ought to be well Hit, and very equal in Thicknefs ' 

&lt; 1 he Manner of conftrudhng the Joints, is thus : We firft, with a Steel-Saw, flit th- Head 
in two Places, fo that there remains a Middle-Piece, the Thicknefs of a Card ; then we flit 
whVh r g ^ V he Compaffes, in * e Midd1 ^ of the Joint, to receive the Middle-Piece 

which was referved for that purpofe ; afterwards the Joints mull be filed and flraightned fo

we have nvetted ,t the Head of the CompafTes muft be warmed, and a little yellow wS 
poured between the Joints, for leaning the Fridion of the Legs' in opening andZttmg

In melting \ of Copper, with ^ of Zink : In foldering, we ufe Borax finely bruifed, which 
makes the Solder better run and penetrate t'he Joint?, or any thing elfe to be foldered. 

Of the German Compajfes. 

Fig. B. The Legs of thefe CompafTes are fomething bent, fo that, when fhut, the Points only 

touch each other. One Point of thefe CompafTes may be taken off, and others put on y by 
means of a fmall fquare Hole made in the Bottom of the Body, for the Points to go in, and a 
Screw to keep them fafl when in : but thefe Points ought very well to fit the aforefaid fquare 
Hole, that they may not fhake. 

The Points generally put on, are, 

Firjiy A Drawing-Pen Point, by means of which, Lines fine or coarfe may be drawn with 
Ink, by help of a little Screw near the Point of the Drawing-Pen. This Drawing- Pen Point, 
as well as the other Points to be put on, has a fmall Joint, almoft like the Head of a Pair of 
CompafTes, by means of which it may be kept perpendicular to the Paper, according as the 
CompafTes are more or lefs opened. This Point is reprefented by Fig. 3. 

Secondly^ A Pencil-carrying Point, reprefented by Fig. 2, for drawing Lines with a Pencil. 

And Laftly y a Dotting- Wheel Point, {Fig. 1.) whofe Ufe is to make dotted Lines. What 
wc call a Dotting-Wheel, is a little Wheel of Brafs, or ether Mttal, about 3 Lines in Diame- 
ter, round which is made little pointed Teeth. This W T heel is faflened between two little 
Pieces of Brafs by a fmall Pin, fo that it may freely turn round, almoft like a Spur ; but the 
faid Teeth muft not be too far diftant from each other, becaufe then the Dots the Wheel 
makes, will alfo be too far diftant from each other. 

The Conftruction of thefe CompafTes as to their Joints, &amp;c. being the fame as thofe before 
fpoken of, I fhall only add, that fince the Beauty of CompafTes confiffo very much in their 
being well polifhed ; for this effect, we firft rub the CompafTes with Slate-Stone dipped ia 
Water ; then we rub every part of the CompafTes with a fiat Stick of foft Wood, and a Mix- 
ture of Emery tempered with Oil, or fine Tripoly. And laftly, we wipe the Compafles 
clean with a Cloth or Piece of Shamoy. 

Of the Spring-Compaffes. 

Fig. C. Thefe CompafTes are all made of tempered Steel, which are fo hard every where, that s 

File cannot touch them ; and the Head of thefe CompafTes is rounded, that by it's Spring it 
opens and fhuts itfelf: the Circular Screw fix'd to one of the Legs, ferves to open or fhut it, 
by means of a Nut- Thefe CompafTes are very fit to- take fmall Lengths, and make fmall 
Divifions ; yet they ought to be but fhort, and fo tempered, that they may have a good 
Spring, and not break. 

Of the Clock-makers Compajfes. 

fig. D. Thefe CompafTes, which are ftrong and folid, ferve to cut Part-board, Brafs, and other 

the like things ; the Quadrant crofting it, ferves flrongly to fix it to a propofed Opening, by 
help of a Screw prefling againft it. The Nut at the End of the faid Quadrant, is to open or 
fhut the CompafTes at pleafure, in turning the faid Nut, which ought to be fo riveted to the 
Leg of the CompafTes, that it may make the other Leg move forwards or backwards. The 
Four Points ought to be made of well tempered Steel. That of Fig-. 1. is filed flopewife, like a 
Graving- Tool, to cut Brafs •, that of Fig. 2. is like a pointed Button : and the two other 
Points are in figure of the fixed Points of common CompafTes; but they muft be very ftrong. 
in proportion to the CompafTes. 

There are different ways of tempering the Points of CompafTes, or other Pieces of Steel : For 
Example ; the Points of fmall CompafTes are tempered by means of a Lamp, and a fmall Brafs 
Pipe: for blowing in the Pipe, caufes a ftrong lively Flame, in which putting the Points, or 
other Things, to be hardened, and they will become almoft inftantly red hot, and when they 
are cold, they will be very hard. But the Points of great CompafTes, and other Steel Tools, 
are tempered with a Charcoal Fire, by blowing thro' the aforefaid Pipe, and heating them to a 
Cherry Colour, and afterwards putting them into Water, and then they will be rendered very 
hard. 

Of the Three-legged Compajfes. 

Jig. E. The Ufe of thefe CompafTes is to take three Points at once, and fo to form a Triangle, or 

to lay down three Pofitions of a Map to be copied at once, fcf c. 

The ConftrucYion of thefe CompafTes doth not much differ from the Conftruction of the 
others, excepting only that the third Leg has a Motion every way, by means of a turned Ri- 
vet, riveted by one End to the two other Legs •, and at the other End there muft be a turned 
Cheek, and a round Plate ferving for a Joint to the third Leg: the little Figure 1 fhows how 
the Rivet is made. 

Of the Sea-Chart Compajfes. 

Fig. F. The Legs of thefe CompafTes are crooked, and widened towards the Mead, fo that by 

preffing the two Legs with your Hand, you may open them. Their Conftruclion fufficiently 
appears from the Figure, and their Ufe will be mentioned in the Inftruments for Navigation. 

Of 



Chap, i • of fever al Sorts of Compafles. 79 

Of thefimple Proportional Compajfes. 
Thefe Compafles are ufed in dividing of Lines into 2, 3, 4&gt; or 5 e Q ual Parts, as alfo to re- Fig G. 
A ice fmall Figures to greater ones, and contrariwife, &amp;V. You muft: take care in making 
thefe Compafles, that the Head be drilled in a right Line with the Legs, and that the Points 
are not one forwarder than another. Now if you have a mind to make one of thefe Pair of 
Compafles to take the [ of a Line, the Diftance from the Center of the Joint to the Ends of 
either of the longeft Legs, muft be twice the Length of either of the fhorteft Legs ; and fd 
in proportion for others. Note, The Compafles of Figure G, are for dividing ot Lines into 
equal Parts j whence the Diftance from the Center marked 5, to the Points 2; 2, is three 
times the Diftance from the faid Center* to the Points 3 or 4 : So that if the third Part of the 
L ine 2, 2, be required, it's whole Length muft firft be taken between the longeft Legs of the 
Compafles, which remaining thus opened, the Diftance between the Points of the fhorteft 
Legs, will be \ of the given Line. 

Of the Mcveabk-headed Proportional Compajfes. 
The Ufe of thefe proportional Compafles, is to divide a given Line into any Number of Fig. H. 
equal Parts, as alio to divide the Circumference of a Circle, fo that a regular Polygon may 
be infcribed therein. 

Thefe Compafles confift of two equal Legs, each of which is fufnifhed with tWo Steel 
Points and are hollowed in, for a Curfor to flip up and down •, in the middle of which Curfor, 
there i's a Screw ferving to join the Legs, and to faften them in divers Places by means of a 
Nut : but the Legs muft be hollowed in exactly in the Middle of their Breadth, that fo the 
Center of the Curfor may be in a right Line with the Points of the Legs, and the Curfor flidei 
very exactly along the Legs : as alfo the Head-Screw muft exactly fill the Hole in the Curfor, 
fo that nothing may fhake when the Legs are fattened* with the Nut. 

Figure 1, reprefents the Screw •, Figure 2, the Nut j Figure 3, half the Curfor, which muft 
be iomed by a like half. You may fee by that little Figure, that there is a Piece in the Middle 
kit exactly to fit the Hollow of the Leg of the Compafles : the fhadowed Spaces of the faid 
Figure, are to contain the two Sides of the Leg j underftand the fame of the other half of the 
Curfor. 

Figure 1, is one of the Legs feparate, upon which are theDiviftons for equal Parts: for 
upon one Side of one of the Legs, are the Divifions for dividing of Lines into equal Parts j 
and upon one Side of the other Leg, are denoted the Numbers fhewing how to inferibe any 
regular Polygon in a propofed Circle. 

Now to make the Divifions for dividing Lines into equal Parts, take a well divided Scale, 
or a Sector, which is better, becaufe it is almoft a univerfal Scale : then take the exact 
Length of one of the Legs of your proportional Compafles between your Compafles, and 
having opened the Sector, fo that the Diftance between 120 and 120 of the Line of Lines be 
equal to that Ertent, take the Diftance from 40 to 40, which lay off upOn the Leg of your 
Compafles, and at the End thereof, fet the Number 2, which will ferve to divide any given 
Line into two equal Parts: The Sector ftill continuing opened to the fame Angle, take the 
Diftance from 30 to 30, on the Line of equal Parts, and lay off upon the aforefaid Leg of the 
Compafles, where fct down the Number 3, and that will give the Divifion for taking 4 of any 
given Line. Again •, take 24 equal Parts, as before, from the Line of Lines, lay them off 
upon the Leg, and that will give the Divifion for dividing a Line into 4 equal Parts. 

Moreover, take 20 equal Parts, and that will give you the Divifion upon the Leg of the 
Compafles, ferving to divide a Line into 5 equal Parts: the fame Opening of the Sector will 
ftiil ferve to divide a Line into 7, 9, and 11 equal Parts. But to avoid Fractions, the afore- 
faid Opening muft be changed, to make the Divifion of 6, 8, 10, and 12, upon the Leg : but 
before the faid Opening of the Sector be altered, take the Diftance from 15 to 15, which will 
give the Divifions for dividing a Line into 7 equal Parts. 

Again i Take 12, and that will give the Divifion for dividing a Line into 9 equal Parts; 
and laftly, the Diftance from 10 to 10, will give the Divifion for dividing any Line into 11 
equal Parts. 

But to make the Divifion for dividing a Line into 6 equal Parts, take between your Com- 
pafles the Length of one of the Legs of the proportional Compafles, and open the Sector fo, 
that the Diftance between 140 and 140, on each Line of equal Parts, be equal to the afore- 
faid Length. The Sector remaining thus opened, take the Diftance from 20 to 20, on each 
Line ot equal Parts, and lay it off upon the Leg of the Compafles, and that will give the Di- 
vifion for dividing a Line into 6 equal Parts. 

Again ; having taken the Length of the Leg of your Compafles, open the Sector, fo that 
the Diftance from 180 to 180, of each Line of equal Parts be equal thereto. Then take 
the Extent from 20 to 20, and that laid off upon the Leg of the Compafles, will give the 
Divifion for dividing a Line into 8 equal Parts. 

Moreover, open the Sector fo, that the Diftance from 1 10 to no, be equal to the Length 
of the Leg ot your Compafles. The Sector remaining thus opened, the Diftance from 10 to 
10, wili give the Divifion for dividing a Line into ten equal Parts- 

Laftly, 



go ¥he CofjftruEiion and Ufes Book III. 

Laftly, the Sector being opened, fo that the Length of the Leg of your Compafles be equal 
to the Diftance from 130 to 130 - r and then the Diftance from 10 to 10 will give the Divifion 
for dividing a Line into twelve equal Parts. 

The Ufe of this Line is eafy : for fuppofe a right Line is to be divided into three equal 
Parts ; firfb pufh the Curfor, fo that the Middle of the Screw may be juft upon the Figure 3 ; 
and having firmly fixed it upon that Point, take the Length of the propofed Line between the 
two lon^eft Parts of the Legs j then the Diftance between the two (horteft Parts of the Legs 
will be 7 of the given Line. Proceed thus for dividing a given Line into other equal Parts. 

Now to make the Divifions for regular Polygons, divide the Leg of your Compafles into 
two equal Parts ; and having opened the Sector, let the Diftance from 6 to 6, on the two 
Lines of Polygons, be equal to one of thofe Parts. The Sector remaining thus opened, take 
the Diftance from 3 to 3 tor a Trigion, and lay it off from the End of the Leg of your pro- 
portional Compafles, where mark 3. Again,, take the Diftance from 4 to 4 for a Square, up- 
on the Line of Polygons, and that will give the Divifion for a Square. Moreover, take the 
Diftance from 5 to s&gt; on tne Lines of Polygons, and lay off upon the Leg of your Com- 
pafles, which will give the Divifion for a Pentagon ; proceed thus for the Heptagon, and the 
other Polygons, to the Dodecagon. It is needlefs to make the Divifion for a Hexagon, be- 
eaufe the Semidiameter of any Circle will divide it's Circumference into fix equal Parts. 

The Ufe of this Line for the Infcription of Polygons is very eafy : for if, for Example, a 
Pentagon is to be infcribed in a given Circle, pufh the Curfor fo, that the Middle of the 
Screw may be againft the Number 5 for a Pentagon ; then with the fhorteft Parts of the 
Legs, take the Semidiameter of the Circle ; and the Legs remaining thus opened, the Diftance 
between the Points of the longed Parts of the Legs, will be the Side of a Pentagon infcribed 
in the given Circle. 

Again, fuppofe a Heptagon is to be infcribed in a Circle j fix the Screw againft the Num- 
ber 7 ; then take the Semidiameter of the Circle between the longeft Parts of the Legs of 
your Compafles, and the Diftance between the fhorteft Parts of the Legs will be the Side of a. 
Heptagon infcribed in the faid Circle. 

Of the Beam-Compafs. 

Pig. K. This Compafs confifts of a very even fquare Branch of Brafs or Steel, from 1 to 3 or 4 

Feet in Length. There are two fquare Brafs Boxes or Curfors exactly fitted to the faid 
Branch, upon each of which may be fcrewed on Steel, Pencil, or Drawing- Pen Points, ac- 
cording as you have ufe for them. One of the Curfors is made to Aide along the Branch, 
and may be made fafl to it by means of a Screw at the Top thereof, which prefles againft: a 
little Spring ; the other Curfor is fixed very near one End of the Branch, where there 15 a 
Nut fo faftened to it, that by turning it about the Screw, at the End of the Branch, the faid 
Curfor may be moved backwarde or forwards at pleafure. 

Thefe Compafles ferve to take great Lengths, as alfo exactly to draw the Circumferences ©f 
great Circles, and exactly divide them. 

Of the ElliptichCompaffes. 

Fig. L. This Inftrument, whofe Ufe is to draw Ellipfes of any kinds, is made of a crofs Branch of 

Brafs, very ftrait and equal, about a Foot long, on which are fitted three Boxes, or Curfors, 
to Aide upon it. To one of the Curfors there may be fcrewed on a Steel-Point, or elfe one 
to draw with Ink, and fometirnes a Porte-Craion. At the Bottom of the two other Boxes 
are joined two Aiding Dove-Tails (as the little Figure 1 fhews), thefe Aiding Dove-Tails are 
adjufted in two Dove-Tail Grooves, made in the Branches of the Crofs. The aforefaid two 
Aiding Dove-Tails, which are affixed to the Bottoms of the Boxes by two round Rivets, and 
fo have a Motion every way, by turning about the long Branch, move backwards and for- 
wards along the Crofs •, that is, when the long Branch has gone half way about, one of the 
Aiding Dove-Tails will have moved the whole Length of one of the Branches of the Crofs ; 
and then, when the long Branch is got quite round, the fame Dove-Tail will go back the 
whole Length of the Branch: underftand the fame of the other Aiding Dove-Tail. 

Note, The Diftance between the two Aiding Dove-Tails, is the Diftance between the two 
Foci of theEllipfis j for by changing that Diftance, the Ellipfis will more or lefs fwell. 

Underneath the Ends of the Branches of the Crofs, there is placed four Steel-Points, to 
keep it faft upon the Paper. The Ufe of this Compafs is eafy ; for by turning round the long 
Branch, the Ink, or Pencil-Point, will draw an Oval, or Ellipfis, required. It's Figure is 
enough to fliew the Conftruction and Ufe thereof. 

Of Cylindrick and Spberick Compaffes. 

Fig. M. Figure M is a Pair of Compafles ufed in taking the Thickneffes of certain Bodies, as Can- 

non, Pipes, and the like things, which cannot be well done with Compafles of but two 
Points. Thefe Compafles are made of two Pieces of Brafs, or other Metal, having two cir- 
cular Points, and two flat ones, a little bent at the Ends. When you ufe them, one of the 

flat 



Chap, r . of fever al Sorts of Compafles. 8 1 

flat-Points muft be put into the Cannon, and the other without ; then the two oppofite Points 
will ftiew the Thicknefs of the Cannon. 

Note, The Head of thefe CompafTes ought to be well drilled in the Center ; that is, if a 
Line be' drawn from one Point to the oppofite one, the faid Line muft exactly pafs thro' the 
Center-, and when the CompafTes are fhut, all the Points ought to touch one another. 
" The' Figure N is a Pair of Spherick CompafTes, which differs in nothing from the Con- Fl 'g N * 
ftruclion of Common CompafTes, except only that the Legs are rounded, to take the Diame- 
ters of round Bodies, as Bullets, Globes, &amp;V. 

Laltly, the Figure O is another Cylindrical Pair of CompafTes, whole j-^egs are equal : The 
Figure is enough to fhew their ConftrucYion and Ufe. 

Additions to CHAP. I* 

Of the Turn-up Compafles , and the Proportional Compafles, with ths 

SeSior Lines upu?t them. 

Of the Turn-up Compafjes. 

T*~ HE Body of thefe CompafTes, is much like the Body of common CompafTes, nigh the Fig. i. 
Bottom of which, and on the outward Faces, are adjufted two Steel Points, one of 
them having a Drawing-Pen Point at the End, and the otlur a Porte-Craion at it's End, fo 
that they may turn round. Nigh the Middle of the outward Faces, are two little Steel Spring 
Catches, to hinder the Points giving way when ufing. The Benefit of this Contrivance, is, 
that when you want to ufe a Drawing-Pen Point, or a Pencil, you have no more to do, but 
turn the Drawing- Fen Point, or the Porte-Craion, until the Steel Points come to the Catch : 
whereas, in a common Pair of CompafTes, you have the trouble of taking off a Steel Point, in 
order to put either of the afortfaid Points in it's place. The Figure of thefe CompafTes is 
fufficient to fhow their Conflruction and Ufe. 

Of the Proportional Compaffes, with the Seftor Lines upon them. 

Thefe CompafTes are made of two equal Pieces of Brafs or Silver, of any Length, the Breadth Fig. 2. 
and Thicknefs of which muft be proportionable. Along the greateft Part of their Length are 
two equal Dove-tail Slits made, in each of which go two Sliding DoVe-tails of the fame 
Length, each having a Hole drilled in the Middle, thro' which pafTes a Rivet, with a turned 
Cheek fixed at one End (which turned Cheek is faftened to one of the Sliding-Dove-Tails), 
and a Nut at the other. There is another equal turned Cheek, faftened to the other Dove- 
tail ; fo that the two Sliding Dove-tails, together with the two turned Cheeks and Rivet, 
make a Curfor to flip up and down the Slits, and likewife ferve as a moveable Joint for the 
Branches of the CompafTes to turn about. 

At the Ends of the aforefaid Pieces of Brafs, or Silver, are fixed four equal Steel-Points, 
the Lengths of each of which muft be fuch, that when the Curfor is flid as far as it can go, 
to either of the Ends of the Slits, the Center of the Rivet may be exactly \ Parts of the Di- 
ftance from one Point to the other. 

At a fmall Diftance from the four Ends of the two Sliding Dove-tails, are drawn acrofs 
four Lines, or Marks •, and when the Center of the Rivet is in the Middle between the Points, 
the Divifions of the Lines on the Broad-Faces, begin from thofe Lines, and end at them : 
But the Divifions on the Side-Faces, begin and end againft the Center of the Rivet, when ic 
is in the Middle between the Points 

The Lines on the firft broad Face of thefe CompafTes, are, \ft, the Line of Lines, divided 
into 100 unequal Parts -, every 10th of which are numbered, at the Top of which is writ Lines. 
idly, A Line of Chords to 60 Degrees, at the Top of which is writ Chords. On the other 
broad Face, are, 17?, A Line of Sines to 90 Degrees, at the Top of which is writ Sines, 
idly, A Line of Tangents to 45 Degrees, at the Top of which is writ Tangents. 

On the firft Side- Face, are the Tangents from 45 Deg. to 71 Deg. 34 Min. to which is writ 
Tang, and on the fecond, are the Secants from o Deg. to 70 Deg. 30 Min. to which is writ 
Sec.

the Point k ; and if with one Foot of your Compaftes in A, and the Diftance Ak, you de- 
1'cribe an Arc cutting the Side AD in the Point 50; the faid Point 50, on the Side AD, will 
be the Divifion for 50 and 50 of the Line of Lines, if the Center of the Curfor was to be did 
ro the Divifions, when the Compafs is ufing. But becaufe the Lines drawn acrofs near the 
Ends of the Sliding Dove-tail, are to be flipped to the Divifions, when the Compaftes are to 
be ufed, the Divifion for 50 muft be as far beyond the Point 50, as the aforefaid Line on the 
Sliding Dove-tail, is diftant from the Center of the Curfor •, which Diftance fuppofe to be G Q^, 
or G L it's Equal. Underftand the fame for all other Divifions, which are found in the man- 
ner that I am now going to (hew. 

Divide D H into 50 equal Parts, and from every of which raife Perpendiculars to cut the 
Arc E D (I have only drawn every 10). Now if from the Point A, to all the Points wherein 
the Perpendiculars cut the Arc ED, right Lines be drawn, cutting the Line E M ; and if 
the Diftances of thefe Sections from the Point A, are laid off from the fame Point on the Line 
A D, the Divifions from o to 50, for the Line of Lines, will be had ; and likewife from 50 
to 100, which are at the fame Diftance from the Center G •, in obferving to place each of 
them, found out as diredled, fo much further from the Center G, as the Line GQJs diftant 
from it. 

The Divifions for the Line of Lines being found, as before directed, they muft each of 
them be transferred to the Face of your Compaftes, and be numbered as per Figure. 

Conjlrutlion of the Line of Chords ', Sines, Tangents, and Secants. 

ig. 4. Having taken half of the Line of Lines, and divided the Spaces from o to 10, 10 to 20, 

20 to 30, 30 to 40, and 40 to 50, into 100 Parts, by means of Diagonals; that half fo di- 
vided, will ferve as a Scale whereby the Tables of Natural Sines, Tangents, and Secants, and 
the Divifions of all the other Lines on thefe Compaftes may be eafily made. 

Now having Aid the Center of the Curfor to the Middle of the Compaftes, the Beginning 
and Ending of the Line of Chords muft be (as in all the other Lines drawn upon thefe Com- 
paftes, two broad Faces) where the Line drawn acrofs the Sliding Dove-tail cuts the Sides of 
the Slit : then to find where the Divifion of any Number of Degrees, or half Degrees, fup- 
pofe 10, muft be, look in the Table of Natural Sines for the Sine of 5 Degrees, which is half 
10, and you will find it 871.557 ; which doubled, will give the Chord of 10 Degrees, viz. 
1743. 1 14: but becaufe the Radius to the Table of Natural Sines, Tangents, and Secants, is 
10000, and from the aforefaid Semi-Line of Lines made into a Diagonal Scale, can be taken 
but 5.00 Parts ; therefore reject the laft Figure to the right-hand, together with the Decimals, 
and you will have 174 for the Chord of 10 Degrees, when the Radius is but 1000, or the 
Length of the Line of Lines. Now take 174 Parts from the Diagonal Scale, and lay them 
off from o, on the Parallels drawn to contain the Divifions of the Line of Chords, and you 
will have the Divifion for 10 Degrees. Again, to find the Divifion for 20 Degrees, look 
for the Natural Sine of 10 Degrees, and it will be found 1736.482 •, which doubled, will give 
the Chord of 20 Degrees, viz. 3472.964, and rejecting the laft Figure to the right-hand, and 
the Decimals, you will have 347, which being taken from your Diagonal Scale, and laid off 
from o o on the Parallels, you will have the Divifion for the Chord of 20 Degrees. In this 
manner proceed for finding the Divifions for the Chords of any Number of Degrees, or half 
Degrees. But note, when you come to the Chord of 29 Degrees, you are got to the furtheft 
Divifion from the Center ; becaufe, from the Table of Sines, the Chord of 29 Deg. is half 
Radius (or at leaft near enough half for this Ufe), or 500, and confequently the Length of 
your whole Scale : therefore you muft, for the Divifions of the Chords of any Number of De- 
grees above 29, lay off the Parts above 500, taken on the Diagonal Scale, from the Divifion 
of 29 Degrees, back again towards the Center, on the other Side the Slit, to 60. As for 
Example •, to find the Divifion for the Chord of 40 Degrees ; the Chord is 684, from which 
500 being fubftracted, you muft take the Remainder 184 from your Diagonal Scale, and lay 
it offjowards the Center, on the Parallels drawn on the other Side of the Slit, from a Point 
over-againft the Divifion for the Chord of 29 Degrees ; and fo for any other. 

The Lines of Sines, or Tangents, on the other broad Face of thefe Compaftes, are made in 
the fame manner as the Line of Chords is: As, for Example, to make the Divifion for the 
Sine of any Number of Degrees, fuppofe 10 ; you will find from the Table of Natural Sines, 
that the Sine of 10 Degrees is 173 ; whence lay off 173 Parts, taken on the Diagonal Scale, 
from the Beginning of the Lines drawn to contain the Divifions, and you will have the Point 
for the Sine of 10 Degrees. Again ; to find the Divifion for the Sine of 25 Degrees, you will 
find from the Table, that 422 is the Sine of 25 Degrees ; therefore take on your Scale 422 
Parts, and lay them off from o, and you will have the Divifion for the Sine of 25 Degrees. 
Thus proceed for the Divifions of any other Number of Degrees, until you come to 30, whofe 
Sine is equal to Half-Radius, and from 30 back again to 90, in obferving the Directions afore- 
given about the Chords, when they return towards the Center. 

The Divifions for the Tangent of any Number of Degrees, fuppofe 10, are likewife thus 
found; for the Tangent of 10 Degrees, by the Table, is 176; wherefore taking 176 Parts 
from your Scale, and laying them off from o o on the Parallels drawn to contain the Divifions, 
the Divifion for the Tangent of 10 Degrees will be had. Again ; to find the Divifion for the 

Tangent 



Chap. i. °f feveral Sorts of Compafles. 83 

Tangent of 25 Degrees -, by the Table of Tangents, the Tangent of 25 Degrees will be found 
a66 , whence taking 466 Parts from your Scale, and laying them off from o o, you will have 
the Divifion for the Tangent of 25 Degrees. Thus proceed for the Divifions of the Tangents 
of any other Number of Degrees, until you come to the Divifion of the Tangent of 26 Deg. 
[yjj n . which is half the Radius ; and from 26 Deg. 30 Min. back again to 45 Deg. whole 
Tano-tnt is equal to Radius, in obferving the Directions afore-given about the Line ol Chords, 

when they return. 

The Conltruction of the Tangents to a fecond and third Radius, on the fide Face of thefe 
Compafles, is thus: Let the Beginning of the fecond Radius, which is at the Tangent of 45 
l&gt;&lt;/rees, be in the Middle between the Points of the Compafles; becaufe when the Compaffes 
is ufnuT, a little Notch in the Side of the turned Cheek, which is directly againft the Center 
of the'Curfor, is (lid to the Divifions: then to make the Divifions for the Tangents of the 
Decrees, and every 15 Minutes, from the Tangent of 45, to the Tangent of 56 Degrees, and 
about 20 Minutes, which is half a fecond Radius, you muft look for the refpective Tangents 
in the Table of Natural Tangents •, and having caft away the laft Figure to the right-hand, 
and the Decimals (which always do), fubftract 1000 from each of them, becaufe that is equal 
to one of our Radius's, and the Remainders take from your Sole, and lay off from 45 -, fo 
fhall you have the Divifions to the Tangent of 56 Deg. and about 20 Min. Then again, to 
have the Divifions from 56 Deg. 20 Min. to 63 Deg. and 27 Min. the Tangent of which is 
equal to 2000, or two of our Radius's, you muft fubftract 1500, which is 2 and a half of 
our Radius's, from every of the refpective Tangents, found and ordered as before directed -, 
and then take each of the Remainders from the Scale, and lay them off from 56 Deg. 20 Min. 
on the Top, and you will have the Divifions of the Tangents of the Degrees, and every 15 
Min. from -56 Dtg. 20 Min. to 62 Deg. 27 Min. which will fall againft 45 Deo-. n the Side 
of the other Branch. Again ; to find the Divifions of the Tangents ol the Degrees, and 
every 15 Minutes, from 63 Deg. 27 Min- to 68 Deg. 12 Min. which makes two Radius's 
and a half, or 2500, you muft fubftract 2000 from each of the Tangents, found and ordered 
as alorefaid, and the Remainders muft be taken off your Scale, and laid off from 63 Deg. 
27 Min. and you will have the Divifions for the Tangents of the Degrees, and every 15 Min. 
from 63 Deg. 27 Min. to 68 Deg. 12 Min. Lajlly, To have the Divifions from 68 Deg. 12 
Min. to 71 Deg. 34 Min. which ends at 45 Deg. and makes up the third Radius, or 3000 : 
you mult fubftract 2500 from each of the Tangents found in the Table, and ordered as before 
directed -, and take off the Remainders from your Scale, which laid off upwards from 68 Deg. 
12 Min. will give the Divifions for the Tangents of the Degrees, and every 15 Minutes, be- 
tween 68 Deg. 12 Min. and 71 Deg. 34 Min. 

The Divifions for the Secants, on the other narrow Face of the Compafles, which run 
from o Degrees, in the Middle between the two Points of the Compaffts, to 70 Degrees, 32 
Minutes, that is, which are the Secants to a fecond and third Radius (like as the Tangents laft 
mentioned) are made exactly in the fame manner, from the Table of Natural Secants, as thofe 
Tangents to a fecond and third Radius are made. 

USE e/ thefe Proportional Compares. 

U S E I. To divide a given right Line into any Number of equal Parts, lefs than 100. 

DWide 100 by the Number of equal Parts the Line is to be divided into, and flip the Cur- 
for fo, that the Line drawn, upon the Aiding Dove-Tail, may be againft the Quotient on the 
Line of Lines : then taking the whole Extent of the Line between the two Points of the Com- 
pafles, that are furtheft diftant from the Center of the Curfor, and afterwards applying one of 
the two oppofite Points to the Beginning or End of the given Line, and the other oppofite 
Point will cut off from it one of the equal Parts that the Line is to be divided into. 

As, for Example •, To divide the Line A B into two equal Parts : 100, divided by 2, gives Fig. J. 
50 for the Quotient i therefore flip the Line on the Dove-Tail to the Divifion 50 on the Line 
of Lines, and taking the whole Extent of the Line AB between the Points furtheft from the 
Center ■, then one of the oppofite Points fet in A or B, and the other will fall on the Point D, 
which will divide the Line A B in two equal Parts. 

Again -, to divide a right Line into three equal Parts, divide 100 by 3, and the Quotient 
will be 33.3 •, therefore flip the Line of the Dove-Tail to the Divifion 33, and for the three 
Tenths conceive the Divifion between 33 and 34 to be divided into 10 equal Parts, and rea- 
sonably eftimate 3 of them. Proceed as before, and you will have a third Part of the faid 
Line, and therefore it may eafily be divided into 3 equal Parts. Moreover, to divide a given 
Line into 50 equal Parts, divide 100 by 50, and the Quotient will be 2 ; therefore flip the 
Line, on the Aiding Dove-Tail, to the Divifion 2 on the Line of Lines. Proceed as at firft, 
and you will have a 50th Part of the Line propofed ; whence it will be eafy to divide it into 
50 equal Parts. 

Note, If each of the Subdivifions, on the Line of Lines, be fuppofed to be divided into 100 
equal Parts j then a Line may, by means of the Line of Lines on thefe Compafles, be divided 
into any Number of equal Parts lefs than 1000. As, for Example ; to divide a Line into 
500 equal Parts : Divide 1000 by 500, and the Quotient will be 2 j therefore flip the Line, 

on 



8 ^ The Conftru&amp;ion and Ufes Book III. 

on the Dove-Tail, to 2 Tenths of one of the Subdivifions of 100, and proceed, as at firft 
diredted, and you will have the 500th Part of the Line given, which afterwards may eafily 
be divided into 500 equal Parts. Again •, To divide a Line into 200 equal Parts : divide 
1000 by 200, and the Quotient will be 50 •, therefore flip the Line, on the Dove- Tail, to 5 
of the Subdivifions of 100, on the Line of Lines, which will now reprefent 50 •, proceed as 
at firft, and you will have the 200th Part of the Line given : therefore it will be eafy to di- 
vide it into 200 equal Parts. Moreover, to divide a given Line into 150 equal Parts, divide 
1000 by 150, and the Quotient will be 6.6 ; wherefore reafonably eftimate 6 of the 10 equal 
Parts that the firft of the Subdivifions of 100 is fuppofed to be divided into, and flip the Line, 
on the Aiding Dove-Tail, to the 6th ; then proceeding as at firft, and the Line may be di- 
vided into 150 equal Parts. If a Line be fo long, that it cannot be taken between the Points 
of your Compaffcs, you muft take the half, third, or fourth Part, isc. and proceed with that 
as before directed •, then one of the Parts found being doubled, trebled, &amp;c. will be the cor- 
refpondent Part of the whole Line. 

U S E II. A right Line being given, and fuppofed to be divided into 100 equal Parts : 

to take any Number of thofe Parts. 

Slip the Line, on the Aiding Dove- Tail, to the Number of Parts to be taken, as io-, then 
the Extent of the whole Line being taken between the Points of the CompafTes, furtheft di- 
ftant from the Curfor, if one of the oppofite Points be fet in either Extreme of the given 
Line, the other will cut off the Part required. 

USE III. The Radius being given ; to find the Chord of any Arc under 60 Degrees. 

Slip the Line, on the Aiding Dove-Tail, to the Degrees fought on the Line of Chords •, 
then take the Radius between the Points of the CompafTes, furtheft diftant from the Center of 
the Curfor, and the Extent, between the two oppofite Points, will be the Chord fought, if 
the given Number of Degrees be greater than 29, whofe Chord is nearly Half-Radius-, but 
if the Number of Degrees be lefs than ig, then the Diftance of the two oppofite Points, taken 
from Radius, will be the Chord of the Degrees required. 

If the Chord of a Number of Degrees under 60 is given, and the Radius to it be required; 
you muft fiip the Line, on the Aiding Dove-Tail, to the Degrees given on the Line of 
Chords ; and taking the Length of the given Chord between the two Points of your Com- 
pafTes, that are nigheft the Curfor, the Extent of the two other oppofite Points will be the 
Radius required. 
Fig. 6. Example, for the firft Part of this Ufe : Suppofe the Length of the Radius be the Line 

A B, and the Chord of 35 Degrees be required •, Slip the Line, on the Aiding Dove-Tail, 
to 35 Degrees on the Line of Chords •, take the whole Extent of the Line A B between the 
Points of the CompafTes, furtheft diftant from the Curfor ; and placing one of the oppofite 
Points in the Point A, the other Point will give the Extent A D for the Chord of 35 Degrees. 
Again ; To find the Chord of 9 Degrees : Slip the Line, on the Aiding Dove-Tail, to 9 De- 
grees on the Line of Chords ; then take the Extent of the Radius, which fuppofe A B, be- 
tween the two Points of the CompafTes, furtheft diftant from the Center ; and placing one of 
the oppofite Points in the Point A, the other will fall on the Point C, and the Difference be- 
tween A B and A C, viz. C B, will be the Chord of 9 Degrees. 

USE IV. The Radius being given, fuppofe the Line A B ; to find the Sine of any Num- 
ber of Degrees, as 50. 

Fig. 7 . Slip the Line, on the Aiding Dove-Tail, to 50 Degrees on the Line of Sines ; then if the 

Extent A B be taken between the two Points of the CompafTes, furtheft from the Curfor, and 
one of the oppofite Points be fet in the Point A, the other will give A C for the Sine of 50 
Degrees ; but if the Sine fought be lefTer than the Sine of 30 Degrees, which is equal to 
Half-Radius, the Difference, between the Extents of the oppofite Points, will be the Sine of 
the Angle required. 

USE V. The Radius being given ; to find the Tangent of any Number of Degrees, not 

above 7 1 . 

If the Tangent of the Degrees, under 26 and 30 Minutes, whofe Tangent is equal to Half- 
Radius, be fought : You muft Aip the Line, on the Aiding Dove-Tail, to the Degrees pro- 
pofed on the Line of Tangents ; and then take the Radius between the Points of the Com- 
pafTes, furtheft diftant from the Curfor, and the Difference between the oppofite Points will 
be the Tangent of the Number of Degrees propofed. 

If the Tangent of any Number of Degrees above 26 and 30 Minutes, and under 45, be 
fought •, then you muft Aip the Line, on the Aiding Dove-Tail, to the Number of Degrees 
given on the Tangent-Line, and take the Radius between the Points of the CompafTes furtheft 
from the Curfor •, then the Diftance, between the two oppofite Points, will be the Tangenc 
of the Degrees required. 

If the Tangent required be greater than 45 Degrees, but lefs than 56 Degrees, and about 
eo Minutes \ you muft Aip the Notch, on the Side of the turned Cheek, to the Degrees of 

the 



Chap. 2. of divers Mathematical Inftruments. 85 

the Tangents upon the Side of the CompaHes, and take the Radius, between the Points of the 
Compaffes, furtheft diftant frorh theCurlor j the Difference between the oppofite Points, added 
to Radius,' will be the Tangent of the Degrees fought. 

If the Tangent required be greater than that of 56 Degrees, 20 Minutes, but lefs than 63 
Degrees, 27 Minutes, you muft flip the Notch to the Degrees propofed, and take the Ra- 
dius as' before, between the Points of the Companies •, then the Extent, between the two op- 
tionee Points, added to Radius, will be the Tangent required. 

If the Tangent required be greater than 63 Degrees, 27 Minutes, but lefs than 68 De- 
grees i you muft flip the Notch, on the Side of the turned Cheek, to the Degrees propofed, 
and take the Radius between the Points of the Compaffes, as before 5 then the Difference be- 
tween the oppofite Points, added to twice Radius, will be the Tangent of the Degrees pro- 

Laitly, If the Tangent be greater than 68 Degrees, but lefs than 71, you muft add the 
Diftance between the oppofite Points of the CompalTes, to two Radius's, and the Sum will 
be the Tangent of the Degrees fought. 

The Secant of any Number of Degrees, under 70, by having Radius given, in obferving 
the aforefaid Directions about the Tangents, may be eafily found*

Of the ConftruElion of divers Mathematical Inflruments. 

Of the Sliding Porte-Craion, or Pencil-Holder. 

THIS Inftrument is commonly about four or five Inches long, the Outfide of which is Plate id 
filed into eight Faces, and the Infide perfectly round, in which a Porte-Craion is put, Fig. A. 
which may be flid up and down by means of a Spring and Button, of which we fhall fpeak 
hereafter. The CompalTes of the Figure B is made to fcrew into one End of this Inftrument. 

There are commonly drawn, upon the Faces of this Porte-Craion, the Sector-Lines, whofe 
manner of drawing is the fame, as thofe on the Sector -, and their Ufe is the fame as the Ufe 
of thofe on the Sector, excepting only that they are not fo general. For Example •, If you 
have a mind to make an Angle of 40 Degrees upon a given Line ; take the Extent of 60 De- 
grees of the Line of Chords, and therewith defcribe an Arc upon the given Line: then take 
the Extent of 40 Degrees, and lay off upon that Arc, and from it's Center draw a Line, which 
will make an Angle of 40 Degrees with the given Line. 

Note, There are alfo round Instruments of this kind, whofe Outfides are divided into In- 
ches, and each Inch into Lines. 

This is ai. other Porte-Craion made of Brafs, round within, and commonly fo without, hav- pig. C, 
ing the Porte-Craion of Figure D made to flip up and down in it. In the Ends of the faid 
Porte- raion are put Pencils, which are made faft by two Rings •, and in the Middle is placed 
a well-hammered Brafs or Steel Spring, having a Female Screw made in it at 1, in order to 
receive the Male Screw at the End of the Button E, which goes thro' a Slit made in the Body 
of the Inftrument. The Figure, and what I have faid, is enough to fhew the Nature of this 
Porte-Craion. 

Of the Fountain-Pen* 

This Inftrument is compofed of different Pieces of Brafs, Silver, &amp;c. and when the Pieces Fig. F. 
F G 1 J are put together, they are about five Inches long, and it's Diameter is about three 
Lines. The middle Piece F carries the Pen, which ought to be well flit, and cut, and fcrewed 
into the Infide of a littler Pipe, which is foldered to another Pipe of the fame Bignefs, as the 
Lid G •, in which Lid is foldered a Male Screw, for fcrewing on the Cover : as likewife for 
ltopping a little Hole at the Place 1, and fo hindering the Ink from running through it. At 
the other End of the Piece F, there is a little Pipe, on the Outfide of which the Top-Covef 
H may be fcrewed on. In this Top-Cover there goes a Porte-Craion, that is to fcrew into 
the laft mentioned little Pipe, and fo flop the End of the Pipe at which the Ink is poured in, 
by means of a Funnel. 

When the aforementioned Pen is to be ufed, the Cover G muft be taken off, and the Pen a 
little fhaken, in order to make the Ink run freely. Note, If the Porte-Craion does not ftop 
the Mouth of the Piece F, the Air, by it's Prefiure, will caufe the Ink all to run out at once. 
Note, alfo, That fome of thefe Pens have Seals foldered at their Ends. 

Of Pincers for holding Papers together \ 

This little Inftrument is made of two well-hammered thin Pieces of Brafs, fattened together Fig. I. 
at top, and having a Brafs Spring between them, and a Ferril, that Aides up and down, in 
order to draw them together. Ttie whole Piece is about two Inches long, and it's Figure is 
enough to fhew the Conftruction and Ufe thereof.

Of the Pentograpb, or Parallelogram. 

Pig k This Inftrument, called a Pentograpb, as ferving to copy any manner of Defigns, is com- 

peted or four Brafs, or very hard Wooden Rulers, very equal in Breadth and Thicknefs ; two 
of them being from 15 to 18 Inches in Length, and the other two but half of their Length, 
and their Thicknefs is ufually 2 or 3 Lines, and Breadth 5 or 6. 

The Exactnefs of this Inftrument very much depends upon having the Holes made at the 
Ends, and in the Middle of the longelt Rulers, at an equal Diftance from the Holes at the 
Ends of the fhortelt Rulers •, for this Reafon, That being put together, they may always make 
a Parallelogram : and when the Inftrument is to be ufed, there are fix fmall Pieces of Brafs 
put on it. 

The Piece 1 is a little turned Brafs Pillar, at one End of which is a Screw and Nut, ferving 
to join and fatten the two long Rulers together 5 and at the other is a little Knob for the In- 
ftrument to Hide upon. The Piece 2 is a turned-headed Rivet, with a Screw and Nut at the 
End ; two of which there mult be for joining the two Ends of the two fhort Rulers to the 
Middle of the long ones, at the Places 2, 2. The Piece 3 is a Brafs Pillar, one End of it be- 
ino- hollowed into a Screw, having a Nut to fit it ; and at the other End is a Worm to fcrew 
into the Table, when the Inftrument is to be ufed. This Piece holds the two Ends of the 
fhort Rulers together, at Fig. 3. Fig. 4. is a Porte-Craion, or Pen, which may be fcrewed 
into the Pillar 4, which is fixed on at the Place 4, to the End of the great Ruler. Laftly, 
Fig. 5. is a Brafs Point, fomething blunt, fcrewed into a Pillar like one- of the former ones, 
which is fcrewed on to the End of the other long Ruler. This Inftrument being put together, 
and difpofed, as per Figure, the next thing will be to fhew it's Ufe. 

Now when a Defign, of the fame Bignefs as the Original, is to be copied, the Inftrument 
nmft be difpofed, as in Figure K ; that is, you mull: fcrew the Worm into the Table at the 
Place 3, and lay the Paper under the Pencil 4, and the Defign under the Point 5 ; then there 
is no more to do but move the Point 5 over every part of the Defign 5, and at the fame time 
the Pencil, at Figure 4, will mark the faid Defign upon your Paper. But if the Defign is 
to be reduced, or made lefs by half, the Worm muft be placed at one F,nd of the long Ruler, 
the Paper and the Pencil in the Middle, and then you muft make the Brafs Point pafs over 
all the Tracls of the Defign, and the Pencil at the fame time will alio have defcribed all thofe 
Tracts j but they will be of but half the Length of the Tracts of the Defign : for this reafon ; 
btcaufe the Pencil, placed in the manner aforefaid, moves but half the Length, in the fame 
time, as the Brafs Point does. And, for the contrary Reafon, if a Defign is to be aug- 
mented, for Example, twice the Original, the Brafs Point and the Defign muft be placed in 
the Middle, at Figure 3, the Pencil and Paper at the End of one of the long Rulers, and 
the Worm at the End of the other long Ruler •, by this means a Defign twice the Original 
may be drawri. 

But to augment or diminifh Defigns in other Proportions, there are drilled Holes at equal 
Diftances upon each Ruler, viz. all along the fhort ones, and half-way the great ones, in or- 
der to place the Pieces carrying the Brafs-Point, the Pencil, and the Worm in a right Line in 
them •, that is, if the Piece carrying the Brafs-Point be put into the third Hole, the two other 
Pieces muft be likewife each put into the third Hole. 

Note, If the Point and the Defign be placed at any one of the Holes of one of thefe great 
Rulers, and the Pencil with the Paper under one of the Floles of the fhort Ruler, which 
forms the Angle, and joins to the Middle of the faid long Ruler, that then the Copy will be 
lefs than half the Original : But if the Pencil and Paper be placed under one of the Holes 
of that fhort Ruler, which is parallel to the long Ruler, then the Copy will be greater than 
half the Original. In a word, all thefe different Proportions will be eafily found by Expe- 



rience. 



Conflriiotion of Sizes : To know the Weight of Pearls. 

Fig. M. This little Inftrument, whofe Ufe is to find the Weight of very fine and round Pearls, is 

made of five thin Pieces, or Leaves, of Brafs, or other Metal, about two Inches long, and 
fix or feven Lines broad. The faid Leaves have feveral round Holes drilled in them of diffe- 
rent Diameters •, the Holes in the firft Leaf ferve for weighing Pearls from half a Grain to 
7 Grains ; thofe in the fecond Leaf are for Pearls from 8 Grains, which is 2 Carats, to 5 
Carats •, thofe in the third for Pearls weighing from 2 ; Carats to 5 ' Carats •, the fourth for 
Pearls weighing from 6 Carats to 8 ; and the fifth for Pearls weighing from 6 f Carats to 8 ^. 

Now the Diameters of the greateft and leaft Holes of each Leaf being found, by weighing 
of Pearls in nice fine Scales, the Diameters of all the other Holes from thence, by proportion, 
may be found. 

The Hole, fhewing the Weight of a Pearl of one Grain, is 2 ' Lines in Diameter ; that 
fhewing the Weight of a Pearl of 2 Carats, is 2 ; Lines-, that fhewing the Weight of a 
Pearl of 5 Carats, is 4 Lines •, that fhewing 2 t Carats, is 2 - v ; that of 5 -*- Carats, is 4 [- 
Lines ; that of 6 Carats, is 4 ' Lines-, that of 8 Carats, is 4 \ Lines; and, Laftly, the Dia- 
meter of that I lole for Pearls weighing 8 I Carats, is 4 : Lines.

The Leaves are fattened together at one End by a Rivet, about which they are moveable, 
and included between two thin Pieces of Brafs, ferving as a Cafe for them. 

Jewellers likewife ufe little Scales, and very fmall Weights, which they call Carats, to 
weioh Diamonds, and other precious Stones, as alfo Pearls that be not round. A Carat is 4 
Grams, and is divided into 4, 4, -*-, and 4 of a Carat : the word Carat is alfo ufed for the De- 
grees of Perfection of Gold ; as a Carat of fine Gold is the 24th part of an Ounce of pure 
Gold, which is fo foft, that it cannot be worked ; for which Reafon the Goldfmiths of Pa- 
ris ufe Gold of 22 Carats, that is, 22 Parts of fine Gold, and two Parts of Brafs ; by which 
Mixture it is rendered harder and fitter to work. 

Of the Fixed Square. 

This Inftrument is called a Fixed Square, becaufe it's Sides do not open or fhut ; all it's F »g- L. 
Exattnefs confifts in being very ftrait, and that both the inward and outward Faces of the 
two Sides be at right Angles ; which that they may be, it is necefiary for them to be pa- 
rallel to each other. 

The Figure N is another Square, which opens or fhuts. Thefe Squares principal Ufes are 
to know whether any Line or Plane be at right Angles to another. 

Of the Foot-Level. 

This Inftrument is compofed of two Branches of Brafs, or other Matter, about half an Fig. O, 
Inch broad, and opens and fhuts like a Two-foot Rule ; half-way the Infide of both thefe 
Branches are hollowed in, to receive a kind of Tongue, or thin Piece of Brafs (which is 
fattened to one of the Branches) that fo the two Branches may be fhut clofe together. The 
Ufe of this Tongue, is fuch, that when the End of it is placed in the Branch it is not fattened 
to, where there is a Pin that holds it, the two Branches of the Level will be fixed at right 
Angles, as per Figure. There is likewife a thin fquare Piece of Brafs adjufted to the Head 
of this Inftrument, that fo it may ferve for a Square, and at the Bottom of the Angle of the 
faid Piece of Brafs is a little Hole made, in which is fattened a Silken Line, with a Plummet 
at the End thereof; which falling upon a perpendicular Line, drawn on the Middle of the 
Tongue, fhews whether any thing the Inftrument is applied to be level or not. Note, The 
inward Angles of the Branches are cut away, that fo the Inftrument may better ftand upon 
a Plane to be levelled. Note alfo, That this Inftrument ferves for a Level, a Square, and a 
Foot-Rule. 

Of the Paris Foot-Rule, and the Comparifon of it's Length with that of other Countries. 

The Conftrudtion of the Body of this Inftrument does not differ from that of the Sector be- Fig. P. 
Fore fpoken of; and when the Paris Foot is only put thereon, each Leg is but about five Lines 
in Breadth ; but when the Foot of other Countries, compared with the Paris Foot, is put 
thereon, it is made broader. I fhall here lay down the Comparifon between the Foot of molt 
chief Towns in Europe, compared with that of Paris. 

A Point is ~, of an ordinary Grain of Barley ; a Line is 12 Points, or theThicknefs of 
one Grain of Barley ; an Inch is 12 Lines, and a Foot is 12 Inches. The Foot Royal of Pa~ 
ris is 12 of the aforefaid Inches, but fometimes it is divided into 720, or 1440 equal Parts, 
for better expretting it's Relations to the Meafures of other Countries. The Foot of Lyons 
and Grenoble is fomething bigger than that of Paris ; for it contains 12 Inches, 7 Lines. The 
Foot of Dijon is letter, and contains but 1 1 Inches, 7 Lines •, that of Befanfon 1 1 Inches, 5 
Lines i that of Macon 12 Inches, 4 Lines; and the Foot of Rouen is equal to thatofPtfnV.

Conjlruclion of Parallel Rules. 

Fig R. Thefe Inftruments are commonly made of Brafs, or hard Wood, from 6 to 18 Inches in 

Length, and about two Lines in Thicknefs : the two parallel Pieces ought to be very ftraight 
every way, and parallel, that is, very equal in Breadth from one End to the other ; for this is 
the chief thing upon which the Exactnefs of thefe Inftruments depends. 

The two parallel Pieces of this Inftrument are joined together by two Brafs Blades, from 
about 2 to 3 4 Inches long, and 6 Lines broad, filed and fafhioned, as per Figure, near the 
Ends of which are round Holes very equally drilled thro' them, which ought to be done by 
laying them one upon the other. Then the parallel Pieces muff, be divided Length-wife into 
two equal Parts, and afterwards one of the Halves of each into 3 equal Parts, and at the firft of 
thefe Parts from the Middle, a Flole muil be made in each parallel Piece, in the Middle of 
their Breadth, in which muft be placed two turned-headed Rivets, for joining one End of 
each Blade to the faid parallel Piece. Likcwifed, near, and equally diftant from the two op- 
pofite Ends of each Piece, mufl two more Holes be made, in which muft be put two more 
Rivets, for joining the other two Ends of the two Blades, to the parallel Pieces. The Pieces 
being thus joined, if you move them backwards and forwards, to the right-hand and the left, 
and the inward Edges of the faid Pieces do exactly meet each other, it is a fign the Rule is 
well made. 

Pj K o The Figure Q^, is another kind of parallel Rule, the two parallel Pieces of which, are 

joined together by two others fomething fhorter, which are joined to each other in the 
Middle, and make a kind of Crofs, which opening or fhutting, caufe the two parallel Pieces 
to recede parallelly from, or accede to each other. In the Middle of each parallel Piece of 
both thefe Inftruments, is fixed a Brafs Button, for more eafier managing them. 

The principal Ufe ot thefe Inftruments, is to draw parallel Lines, by opening or fhutting 
the parallel Pieces, and are of excellent Ufe in Architecture and Fortification, wherein a great 
Number of parallel Lines are to be drawn. 

Conjlruclion of the Pedometer or Waywifer. 

Fig. S. This Inftrument is about two Inches in Diameter, commonly about 7 Lines in Thicknefs, 

and hath all it's Parts joined together a Cafe, almoft like that of a Watch. 

The Plate T, is placed in the Bottom of the Cafe, upon which are fattened feveral Pieces, 
as they appear per Figure. The Piece 1, is a little Steel Catch with it's two Springs ; this 
Catch is held by a round Tenon going into a Hole in the faid Plate, fo that by pulling the 
Piece F, which is fattened to one End of the Catch, the faid Catch turns round the Steel 
Star 2, having 6 Points, and carrying a Pinion of Six Teeth of the fame Height as the two 
Wheels, of which we are going to fpeak. The Spring 4, is for hindering the Star from going 
back •, and that marked 5, is to lift up the End of the Catch, when it hath made the Star 
move one Point forwards. 

The Plate V is like the Plate T, only it hath upon it two equal Wheels placed on each 
other-, the upper Wheel hath 100 Teeth, and the under one 101, which are both put in Mo- 
tion by the Pinion upon the Star •, fo that when the upper Wheel hath gone round once, and 
run 100 equal Parts, with it's Hand upon the greater Dial-Plate S •, the Wheel which hath 
101 Teeth, wants one of going round, and makes the leffer Hand move the !- Part of the 
Circumference of the leffer Dial- Plate the contrary way, whence the greater Hand mufl go 
round 100 times, before the little Hand hath gone round once the contrary way ; and con- 
fequeiitly, the Piece F muft be pulled 10000 times, before the little Hand will go round once : 
there are 3 Tenons fixed to the under Plate, by means of which, the upper Plate is fattened 
to it with little Pins. 

The 



Chap. 2. of divers Mathematical Inftruments. 89 

The whole Machine is inclofed in it's Cafe, covered with a GJafs, and having on one Side 
of it two Rings, thro' which a String is put for hanging the Inftrument to any thing; and at 
the other Side'of the Cafe, is an Opening left for the Piece F to come out thro', which Piece 
receives a String fattened to one's Garter. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument is fuch, that being hung to a Perfon's Belt, at each Tenfion 
of the Knee, that is, every time he ftcps forwards, the String pulls the Piece F, and this the 
Catch, which caufes the greater Hand to move one Divifion forwards. When any Perfon 
hath a mind to know how many Paces he hath moved, he muft look upon the Dial-Plate, and 
that will inform him. Note, A Pace is nearly 2 Foot, and a Perfon in walking may fo ac- 
cuilom himfelf, as to take his Steps of that Length ; but when Ground is not level, Paces are 
not equal, for in defcending they are longer, and in afcending fhorter, which muft be regard- 
ed, and corrected by Experience. 

There are alfo thefe kinds of Inftruments made, and fitted to Wheels of known Circum- 
ferences •, for Example, a Fathom round : fo that every time the Wheel comes to a certain 
point, where there is a Tenon which pulls the Piece F, the Catch caufes the larger Hand to 
move'one Divifion forwards ; and by this means you may know how many Fathom you have 

gone. 

Pedometers are likewife adjufted behind Coaches, fo that when one of the great Wheels of a 
Coach comes to a certain Point, it caufes the Catch to move the Hand one Divifion forwards, 
fo that in knowing the Circumference of the faid Wheel, the Length the Coach hath moved 
may be known. 

Not.;, ' The leffer Dial-Plate muft be carried round by the upper Wheel of ioo Teeth, or 
4 t lie it will not at any time be eafy to tell, how many Paces you have gone by the faid lefTef 
4 Plate, but muft ftay 'till the Hand of the greater Plate hath made one Revolution.' 

The Confiruciion of a Machine for cutting and dividing the Wheels, and Pinions of Clocks, 

or Watches. 

The Machine A, is for cutting and dividing the Wheels and Pinions of Clocks and Watches, 
and is very commodious, and extremely fhortens the Time of doing them. 

The Plate A is made of Brafs, very even, about 8 Inches Diameter, and one Line in Thick- Fig. i, 
nefs, having feveral Concentrick Circles drawn upon it, whofe Peripheries are divided into 
feveral even or uneven Numbers of equal Parts, the greater of which are always more diftant 
from the Center. 

As for Example •, to divide the Periphery of one of the Circles into 120 equal Parts, you 
muft firft divide the faid Periphery into 2 equal Parts, each of which will be 60, which again 
fubdivide by 2, and each Part will be 30 ; which again divided by 2, and each Part will be 
15, which being divided by 3, produces 5. Laftly, dividing each of thefe laft Parts by 5, 
the whole Periphery will be found divided in 120 equal Parts. 

But if one of the Circles is to be divided into an odd Number of equal Parts, for Example, 
into 81, you muft firft divide it into 3 equal Parts, each of which will be 27, which being 
divided by ?, will produce 9 ; each of which being divided by 3, will produce 3 ; each of 
which being again divided by 3, will produce 1 : wherefore the Periphery of the Circle will 
be divided into 81 equal Parts. 

The like may be done for any other Number, in taking the moft proper aliquot Parts there- 
of, to make a propofed Divifion. 

The Circles of the Plate being divided, there ought to be made, at every Divifion, fmall 
round Holes, with a fine Steel Point. 

Now when a Clock Wheel is to be fimply divided by means of thefe Concentrick Circles, in 
order to cut it with the Hand, the faid Wheel muft be placed upon the Arbre in the Center 
of the Plate, and having fixed it faft, you muft divide it with a fine Steel Ruler, one End of 
it being placed in the Center : then by moving the faid Ruler round from Divifion to Divifion, 
upon the Circumference of one of the Concentrick Circles, anfwerable to the Number of 
Teeth the Wheel is to have, the Wheel may be divided •, which being done, the Teeth 
muft be made with a very fine File, obferving to leave as much Space between them, as you 
file away. 

But when this Machine is ufed to very expeditioufly cut Clock Wheels, it is compofed in 
the following Manner. 

Fig. 1. reprefents the Plan of the whole Machine put together, and fit for Ufe. 

The Piece 1, is a Steel Saw- Wheel, the Breadth of the Interval between the Teeth of a 
Wheel to be cut by it: this Saw- Wheel is placed upon a fquare Arbre, as likewife a little 
Pully, to turn it between two Steel Points. The Place 2, is the Porte-Touret, having a 
Motion at the two Ends thereof, like the Head of a Pair of Compares, that fo the file 
Wheel may be raifed, or lowered, at pleafure. 

At the Place 1, of Figure 2, is the Saw-Wheel put upon it's Arbre, as likewife the Pully 
between the two Steel Points, that are fattened by 2 headed-Screws 7, 7. The two Ends of 
the Porte-Touret, are reprefented by 2, 2. The Screws 9, 9, are for fixing the Part of the 
Machine carrying the Saw- Wheel, upon the Square Iron Ruler 3, which is put thro' a fquare 
Hole, between the Screws 9, 9. There are two of the faid Iron Rulers, that is, there is one 

A a above 



po The ConftruEiion and Ufes Book III. 

above the circular Brafs Plate, and another underneath it, both of them being of a convenient 
Bignefs, and are fo fattened together at the Ends by ftrong Screws, that there is room enough 
left between them for the circular Brafs Plate, and alfo for the Touret, or Frame, and a kind 
of Spring, which carries the Point (of which we (hall fpeak prefently), to Aide freely along 
the lquare Iron Ruler 3. 

Figure 3, reprefents the Side-Draught of the whole Machine put together, whereof the 
Piece 1, is the Touret, or Frame, placed near the Wheel to be cut, which is reprefented by 
Number 6 : this Wheel is placed in the Center of the Brafs Plate, and is faflened by the Arbre 
Screw. The Piece 3, is the Iron Ruler along which the Touret of Figure 2 Aides, as alfo 
the Spring carrying the Point 4 : and Number 5 is a Piece of Iron, by means of which the 
Machine may be fafbened in a Vice, when it is to be ufed. 

Figure 4, is a very fine and well -tempered Steel-Point, fcrewed into the End of a kind of 
Spring, having a circular Motion, that thereby the faid Steel-Point may be put into any of 
the Holes of the Circumferences of either of the concentrick Circles upon the Plate. There 
is likewife another Piece joined to the Spring, is order to keep, by means of a Screw, the 
Point upon any propofed Divifion of the Circumference of any of the concentrick Circles, 
while one Tooth of a Wheel is fawing. 

Laftly, Figure 5, is the Arbre placed in the Center of the Machine, and upon which is put 
the Wheels to be cut, which are firmly fixed thereon, by means of Screws at the Top and 
Bottom. There are commonly feveral Arbres of different BignefTes, in proportion to the 
Holes in the Centers of Wheels to be cut. 

The Ufe of this Machine is eafy, for you have no more to do but fix a Wheel to be cut 
into Teeth, in the Center (at Number 6), and then fit the Spring (reprefented by Fig. 4.) fo 
that it's Point may exactly fall upon the Divifions of that concentrick Circle, which is divid- 
ed into the fame Number of equal Parts you defign your Wheel to have Teeth ; and then 
you mull move the Touret, with it's Saw-Wheel, to cut the Wheel, by means of a Male- 
Screw (one End of which goes into a round Hole 8, in the Bottom of the Touret, and is 
there faflened with a Pin), and a Female Screw to fit it, at the End of the Iron Ruler, denoted 
by Number 5 •, fo that by turning the faid Male-Screw, the Touret may be moved back- 
wards and forwards at pleafure. The Saw-Wheel being thus placed, you muft turn it 4 or 
5 times about, by means of a Bow, whofe String is put about the Pully, and then one Side 
of a Tooth will be cut; and having moved the Steel-Point 4, to the next Divifion in the Cir- 
cumference of that concentrick Circle upon the Plate, whofe Divifions are the fame in Num- 
ber you defign your Wheel to have Teeth, give 4 or 5 Strokes with the Bow, and the other 
Side of the 1 ooth will be cut : and in this manner may all the Teeth be cut ; Pinions are alfo 
thus cut. 

Note, There are Saw- Wheels of divers ThicknefTes, conformable to the Space there ought 
to be left between the Teeth of different Wheels. 

The ConftruEiion of Armour for Load-Stones, as alfo how to cut the faid Stones, in order to 

arm them. 

The Figures 6, 7, reprefent two armed Load-Stones -, the firfl in the Form of a Parallele- 
pipedon, and the fecond in the Form of a Sphere : But before we fhew the bed way of arm- 
ing them, we will enumerate fome of the Properties and Virtues of Load- Stones. 

The Load-Stone is a very hard and heavy Stone, found in Iron Mines, and is almofl the 
Colour of Iron, for which reafon it is reckoned among the Metallick Kind : it hath two won- 
derful Properties, one whereof is to attract Iron, and the other to direct itfelf towards the 
Poles of the World. 

The Load-Stone attracts Iron, and reciprocally Iron attracts the Load-Stone, notwithstand- 
ing any other Body's Interpofition between them. This Stone likewife communicates to Iron 
a Faculty of attracting Iron : For Example, an Iron Ring that hath been touched with a good 
Load-Stone, will lift up another Iron Ring by only touching it, and this fecond a third, &amp;c. 
but the firfl Ring muft have a greater Degree of Attraction, than the fecond, and the fecond 
than the third, &amp;V. 

The Blade of a Knife that hath been touched with a Load-Stone, will likewife lift up 
Needles, and fmall Pieces of Iron : alfo feveral Sewing-Needles being laid upon a Table in 
a Row, and a Load-Stone being brought near the firfl, by which receiving the Magnetick 
Virtue, the faid firfl Needle will attract the fecond, the fecond the third, &amp;c. 'till they all 
come together. 

That Iron reciprocally attracts the Load-Stone, when it can move freely, may be thus 
fhewn : For if you put a Load-Stone into a hollow Piece of Cork, and fet it floating upon 
the Surface of a Bafon of Water, and bring a Piece of Iron at a convenient Diftance to it, the 
Piece of Cork, together with the Stone, will accede to the Iron. 

That Property of the Load-Stone which is always to refpect the Poles of the World, may 
be fhewn by the following Experiment: For having put a Load-Stone into a hollow Piece of 
Cork, and fet them both a floating upon the Surface of (till Water (there being no Iron, or 
other Obflacle near), the Load-Stone will always fo difpofe itfelf, that one certain Point thereof 
will regard the North, and the oppofite Point the South. 

But 



Chap. 2. of divers Mathematical Inftruments. qi 

But you mud note, that the Load-Stone doth not exactly refpect the North, it having at 
different Times, and in different Places of the Earth's Superficies, different Declinations, or 
Variations therefrom, and at this time at Pan's, varies i2Deg. i5Min. Weftward : fo that 
the South Pole of the Load-Stone varies above 12 Degrees from that of the World, and it's 
Oppofite fo likewife. The Poles of a Load-Stone, are thofe two Places thereof, that refpect 
the two Ma^netick Poles of the World ; and the principal Axis, is a right Line drawn from 
one Pole to°the other, about which, the greatefl Force of the Load-Stone manifefts itfelf, 
"nd at the two Poles is greatefl. Spherical Load-Stones have alfo ficted Equators, and Me- 
ridians, i3c. from whence they are called Magnetick Spheres. 

Now in order to find the Poles of a Load-Stone, you muft cut a Hole in a Card of the 
Figure of the Stone, in which the Stone muft be put, fo that it's principal Axis may be 
found in the Plane of the Card. This being done, Iron or Steel Filings muft be ftrewed 
upon it : after which ftrike the Card foftly with a little Stick, fo that by putting the Filings 
in Motion, the Magnetick Matter may let them take a Circuit conformable to the way which 
that Matter takes in moving from a North Pore to another South one, and you will perceive 
the Filings ranged in the Figure of feveral Semi-Circumferences, whole oppofite Ends ar^. ^e 
Poles of the Load-Stone. 

The Poles of a Load-Stone may otherwife be found, in plunging it into Iron or Steel Fi- 
lings, or into very little Bits of Steel Wire ; for then they will make different Configurations 
round the Stone, fome of them lying flat on it, others half t)ent •, and finally, others quite 
upright on it : and thofe Places of the Stone where the little Bits of Steel are perpendicular to 
it, are the Poles ; and where they lie along, is the Equator. 

Havino- thus found the Poles of a Load-Stone ; which is the North or South Pole, may be 
known in laying the Stone in a hollow Piece. of Cork, fwimming on Water, or by fufpending 
it with a Thread, fo that it's Axis be parallel to the Horizon ; for then that Pole of the Stone 
turning towards the North Pole of the World, will be the South Pole of the Stone, and the 
oppofite Point the North Pole. 

The Poles of a Load-Stone may likewife be found by means of a Compafs; for bringing a 
touched Needle to the Stone, the End that was touched, will immediately turn towarc that 
Pole of the Stone agreeing therewith, and the other End of the Neeale will likewife turn to- 
wards the other Pole of the Stone. 

The Poles of the Stone being found, the next thing will be to cut, and give it a regular 
Figure, in taking away the Superfluities either with a Saw, and Powder of Emery, or elfe 
with a Knife- Grinder's Grind-ftone, preferving it's Axis as long as poffible, and giving a like 
Figure to it's Poles. 

Now to make a great many Experiments, it is neceffary to give to a Load-Stone the moft 
regular Figure poflible, which is determined by the Likenefs it hath to that of the irregular 
Mafs it is compofed of: the Cube, the Parallelepipedon, the Oval, and the Round are to 
be preferred, on account of having the principal Axis of the Stone as long as may be. If a 
Load-Stone is to be made in Form of a Sphere, it will not be difficult to find it's Poles and 
Axis ; you need only figure it with Powder of Emery in a round Iron Concave, and after- 
wards finifh it with find Sand, in a round Brafs Concave. 

A Load-Stone in Figure of a Sphere, is very fit for many Experiments, and it's Poles may 
be found in manner aforefaid : but it is neceffary, before any pains be taken in cutting and 
figuring of a Load-Stone, to be affured of it's Goodnefs, in observing whether it ftrongly at- 
tracts Filings, or little Bits of Steel ; and whether there be not other Matter pafiing thro' it's 
Pores, which hinders the Magnetical Matter from circulating and paffing from one Pole to the 
other. 

The Goodnefs of a Load-Stone confifb in two effential Things j which are, firft, That it 
be homogeneous, having a great Number of Pores filled with Magnetick Matter, which paf- 
fing thro' them form about the Stone, as it were, a very extenfive Whirlwind. In the fecond 
place, it's Figure very much contributes to it's Force (as we have already faid), for it is cer- 
tain, that of all Load-Stones of a like Goodnefs, that which hath the beft Poles, it's Axis 
longeft, and whofe Poles meet exactly in the Extremes, will be moft vigorous. 

Two Load-Stones placed in two hollow Pieces of Cork, which are both fet floating upon 
the Surface of the Water, having their Poles of contrary Denominations tur :ed to each other, 
will accede to each other •, but if the Poles of the fame Denomination be turned towards each 
other, then the Load-Stones will mutually recede from one another. 

If a Load-Stone be cut into two Pieces, parallel to it's Axis, the Sides of the Pieces that 
were together before theDivifion, will mutually recede from each other. 

But if a Load-Stone be cut into two Pieces, according to it's Equator, the Sides of the 
Pieces that were together before they were cut, will be found to have Poles of a contrary De- 
nomination, and will accede to each other. 

A ftrong Load-Stone touching a weak one, will attract it with it's Pole of the fame Deno- 
mination, &amp;c. 

The

The Defcription of the Armour ; or Capping for Load-ftones. 

Fig. 6. The Armour for a Load-ftone, cut into the Form of a right-angled Parallelepipedon, is 

compofed of two fquare Pieces of very fmooth Iron or Steel ; but tempered Steel is better 
than Iron, becaufe it's Pores are clofer, and there are a greater Number of them. Care muft 
be taken, that the Armour well cncompafles, and exactly touches the Poles of the Load-ftone, 
and that the Armour is in Thicknefs proportionable to the Goodnefs of the Stone : for if 
ftrong Armour be put upon a weak Stone, it will produce no Effect, becaufe the magnetick 
Matter will not have force enough to pafs thro' it-, and, on the contrary, if the Armour of a 
ftrong Stone be too thin, it will not contain all the magnetick Matter it ought, and confe- 
quently the Stone will not produce fo great an Effect, as when the Armour is thicker. 

Now, to fit the Armour exactly, you muft file it thinner by Degrees •, and when you find 
the Effect of the Stone to be augmented as much as poflible, the Armour will be in it's juft 
Proportion, and will have it's convenient Thicknefs ; after which it muft be fmoothed within 
Side, and polifhed without. 

The Heads of the Armour (whereon is writ North and South) muft be thicker than the 
other Parts, and cover about 4 of the Length of the Axis. 

The Breadth and Length of the Armour, beft fitting a Stone, may alfo be found by filing 
it by little and little ; bur, above all, Care muft be taken that the two Heads are equal in 
Thicknefs, and that their Eafes very exactly meet in the fame Plane. Number 5 is a Brafs or 
Silver Girdle fitted about the Stone, ferving to faften and hold the Armour, by means of two 
Screws 1, 1 ; and at 6 and 6 are two Screws laftening a round Brafs Plate, carrying the Pen- 
dant 4, and it's Ring, to the Top of the Armour, 
fig. 7. The Armour of a fpherical Load-ftone is compofed of two Steel Shells, faftened to the 

Piece 8 by two Joints 6, 6 ; of a Girdle 5, 5 •, of a Pendant and Ring 4 •, and of a Piece (or 
Porte-Poid) 2, to hold the Hook 3 Great Care muft be taken that the Shells very exactly 
join the Superficies of the Stone, and that they well encompafs the Poles of the Stone, and 
cover the greateft part of the Convexity thereof. The convenient Breadth and Thicknefs of 
this Armour may be found by Trials, as before- mentioned. 

It is very wonderful, that two little Pieces of Steel, compofing the Armour of a Load-ftone, 
fhould give it fuch a Property, that a good Stone, alter it is armed, will attract above 1 50 
times more than before it was armed. 

There are indifferent good Stones, which, unarmed, weigh about three Ounces, and will life 
up but half an Ounce of Iron •, but being armed, will lift up more than feven Pounds. 

To preferve a Load-ftone, you muft keep it in a dry Place among little Bits of Steel-Wire ; 
for Filings, which are always full of Duft, make it rufty. 

We fometimes fufpend Load-ftones, fo that having the liberty to move, they may conform 
themfelves to the Poles of the World ; and if, in this Situation, the Piece carrying the Hook, 
or Porte-Poid, be put on, and the Weight the Stone commonly carries be hung on, and from 
time to time there be hung to it fome fmall Weight more, you will find that, when the Stone 
has continued fufpended fome Days, that it will lift up a much greater Weight than it did be- 
fore it was hung up. 

Several common Experiments made with the Load-Jlone. 

The firft and ufefulleft Experiment made with the Load-ftone, is that of touching the Nee- 
dles of Sea-CompafTes •, for rightly doing of which, you muft draw the Needle foftly over one 
of the Poles of the Load-ftone, from it's Middle to it's End, and then it will receive it's Virtue. 
But, Note, that that End of the Needle, which hath been touched with one of the Poles of a 
Load-ftone, will turn towards the oppofite Part of the World, to that which that Pole regards ; 
therefore it the End of a Needle is to turn towards the North, it muft be touched with that 
Pole of the Stone refpecting the South. Note, The longer Needles are, the lefs will they 
vibrate. 

This admirable Direction of the Load-ftone and Touched Needle hath not been known in 
Europe much above two hundred Years, by means of which, Navigation hath been almoft in- 
finitely advanced. But there is one Inconveniency, which is, that a Touched Needle doth 
not exactly refpect the Poles of the World, but declines or varies therefrom towards the Eaft 
or Weft, at different Times, and in different Places, varioufly. In the Year 1610, it varied 
at Paris 8 Degrees North-Eafterly ; in 1658, it had no Variation j and in the Year 1716, it 
varied about i2Deg. ^Min. Weftward. 

Moreover, the Needle hath alfo an Inclination as well as a Declination ; that is, the Nee- 
dle of a Sea-Compafs being in Equilibrio upon it's Pivot, will, when touched, lofe that Equi- 
librium, and the End that turns North, on this fide the Equator, will drip or incline towards 
the Earth, as if it was heavier on that Side ; for which reafon the North Side of a Needle 
muft be made lighter, before the Needle be touched, than the South Side, and going towards 
the Poles, this Inclination grows greater ; but in going towards the Equator, it grows Itffer : 
fo that under the Equator, the Inclination will be nothing ; and in palling the Line, the 
other End of the Needle, refpecting the South, will begin to incline ; fo that Pilots are 
obliged to ftick as much Wax to the End of the Needle, as will make it in Equilibrio. Ncte, 

The 



Chap. 2. of divers Mathematical Inftruments. 93 

The greater Force that Load-ftones, which touch Needles, have, the more will the Needles 

There are Needles purpofely made to obferve this Inclination, which at Paris is about 70 

De°rees. 

It a long thin Piece of Steel be drawn over one of the Poles of an armed Load-done (in the 
fame manner as was faid before of the Needles), this Piece of Steel will in an inftant acquire 
the magnetick Virtue, and will not lofe it but by degrees after feveral Months, unlefs it be 
put in the Fire. Note, A Piece of Steel, touched by a good Stone, will lift up 14 Ounces. 

The two Ends of a Steel Blade thus touched will become North and South Poles ; that 
End whofe Contact ends on the South Pole of the Stone, being the North, and the other the 
South Pole : for if this Piece of Steel be made light enough to fwim, one End thereof will 
turn to the North, and the other to the South. 

A«uin ; that End of the Steel Blade where the Contact ended, will attract much ftronger 
than 'the other End •, and if the faid Blade be once drawn over the Stone the contrary way, it 
will quite lofe it's Virtue, and attract no more. Understand the fame of the Needle of a Com- 
pafs, the Blade of a Knife, &amp;c. two touched Steel Blades will avoid each other, and approach 
like two Load-ftones. 

A Piece of Steel, in a hollow Piece of Cork fwimming on the Water, may be any ways 
moved, by bringing the Pole of a Load-ftone towards it, or another touched Piece of Steel. 

A fine Sewing-Needle, fufpended by a Thread, will fliew what is meant by Sympathy and 
Antipathy ; for this Needle will be repelled by one Pole of a Load-ftone, and attracted by 
the other. 

A Needle may be kept upright, without it's touching a Load-ftone ; fo that there may be 
put between it and the Stone, a Piece of Silver, or other Matter, provided it be not Iron. 

If, about a Load-ftone, fufpended by a String, be circularly placed fevetal little touched 
Needles of a Compafs, upon their Pivots, and the Load-ftone be moved any how, you will 
likewife fee all the Needles move in a pleafant manner j and when the Stone eeafes moving* 
the Needles will alfo ceafe. 

What we have already fpoken about ftrewihg of Filings about a Load-ftone, may be faid 
alfo of ftrewing them about a Piece of touched Steel. 

If Filings be ftrewed upon a Piece of Paftcboard, and a Load-ftone be moved under it, thd 
Filings will erect themfelves, and then lie along on that Side from whence the Stone earner 

If, inftead of Filings, you lay upon a Piece of Pafteboard feveral Bits of the Ends of bro- 
ken Needles •, by bringing one Pole of a Load-ftone towards them, they will erect themfelves 
upon one of their Ends j and by bringing the other Pole, they will fall, and rife upon their 
other Ends. 

It is eafy to feparate a black Powder mixed with white Sand, and propofing it to a Perfon* 
not knowing the Secret, he will think it impoffible ; for if Iron Filings be mixed with fine 
Sand, they may be feparated from it by a Load-ftone, or Piece of touched Steel: for either of 
them being p..t into the Mixture, at divers times, you may get all the Filings from among 
the Sand. 

A Load-ftone will lift up a Whirlegig in Motion, whofe Axis is Steel ; and if it be fome- 
thing heavy, it will turn a longer Time in the Air than upon a Table, where the Friction 
foon ftops it's Motion ; and if the Stone be a good one, this Whirlegig may lift up another, 
and both of them will turn contrary 'Ways. Another diverting Experiment may yet be made, 
by putting little Steel Fifties, or Swans, into a flat Bafon of Water ; for by moving a good 
Load-ftone under the Bafon, you will fee them prettily fwimming about j and moving the Stone 
different ways, they will likewife have different Motions ; if the Stone be turned round, the 
Fifties will alfo turn round ; if the Pole of the Stone be turned towards them, they will 
plunge themfelves, as it were, to join themfelves to the Stone. You may likewife put little 
Steel Soldiers into the Bafon, which may be made to approach to, or recede from, each other 
in form of a Battel ; and by bringing the Equator of the Stone towards them, they will fall 
down. 

It is pleafant enough to fee a Sewing-Needle threaded, or a little Arrow, fattened by a 
Hair to the Arc of a Cupid*s Bow, remain fufpended in the Air eight or ten Lines diftant 
from a good Load-ftone. 

There are feveral other Experiments made with the Load-ftone, but mentioning thefn here 
would take up too much time* 

The ConftriitTion of an Artificial Magnet. 

This Inftrument, invented by Mr Joblot, is compofed of feveral very ftrait Steel Blades Fig.*, 
laid upon one another ; and to make it paflably good, there ought to be at leaft 20 of them 
(according to the force of the Magnet to be made), each about 10 Inches long, 1 Inch broad, 
and half a Line in Thicknefs. It is ufelefs to make them thicker* becaufe the magnetick Vir- 
tue will not penetrate further into the Steel Blades. 

Now thefe Blades being firft touched with a good Stone* are afterwards laid one upon ano- 
ther, having their Poles, of the fame Denomination, turned the fame way, forming a Paral- 
Wepipedon ; then they are prelTed together with four Brafs Stirrups, and as many little Wed-

Breadth, and Thicknefs. This Armour is held by a Brafs Girdle, and fattened with the 
Screws 2, 2. At the Top is placed a Brafs Plate, to which h fattened the Pendant 4, and it's 
Ring •, and at the Bottom is the Port-Poids 5. But, Note, That the Bafe of the Porte-Poids 
muft make the perfected Contact poftible with the Heads a, b, of the Armour. When arti- 
ficial Magnets are well made, and touched with good Stonc-s, they will have as much Virtue 
in them as good natural ones, and may be ufed for the fame Experiments. 

The Conftruftion df the Spring Steel-yard. 

f'g 9. This Machine, which is portable, and ferves to weigh any thing from one Pound to about 

forty, is compofed of a Brafs Tube or Pipe, open at the Ends, about 4 or 5 Inches long, 
and 7 or 8 Lines broad, one End whereof is marked 3 ; the reft being open for fhewing the 
Infide, which is a Spring (2) of tempered Steel-Wire, made like a Worm. Number 6. is a 
little Feril fcrewed upon the Top of the fquare Brafs Rod 1, which the Spring croffes. Up- 
on this Rod are the Divifions of Pounds, and Parts of a Pound, which are made in fucceflively 
hanging on the Hook (4.) r, 2, 3, tec. Pounds : for the Spring being fattened by a Screw to 
the Bottom of the fquare Rod, the greater the Weight is, that is hung on the Hook, the more 
will the Spring be contracted •, and confequently a greater part of the Rod will come out of 
the Tube, thro' the fquare Hole C : therefore if you have a mind to mark the Divifion for 
any Number of Pounds upon the Rod, fuppofe 10, hang 10 Pounds upon the Hook, and 
where the Edge of the fquare Hole C, at the Top of the Tube, cuts the Rod, make a Mark 
upon the Rod for 10 Pounds, and fo for any pther. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument is very eafy ; for having fcrewed the Feril 6 on the Top of 
the Rod, if you hold the Inftrument in your Hand by the Hook 5, and hang any thing to be 
weighed upon the Hook 4 ; then where the Edge C of the fquare Hole cuts the Rod, will be 
the Weight of the thing required. 

The chief Goodnefs of this Inftrument confifts in having a well- tempered Spring ; fo that 
it may fold according to the Force of the Weight it is to carry, and alio in having a Bignefa 
proportionable. 

The Conjlruffion of the Beam Steelyard. 

frig, to, This Inftrument, which is a kind of Steel-yard, or Balance of Mr Cajini's Invention, 

confifts of a Rod fufpended by a Beam, in it's Point of Equilibrium 5, which divides the faid 
Rod into two Arms (like the two Arms of a common Balance) each of which are lengthwife 
divided into equal Parts, beginning from the Point of Sufpenfion or Equilibrium. 

The Ufe of this Balance is to find both the Weight and Price of Goods at the fame time. 
If you ufe it for weighing any thing, the Counter-Weight 4 of one Pound, or one Ounce, 
muft be hung to one of the Arms (according as Goods are to be weighed by Pounds or 
Ounces), fo that it may Aide along the Arm, like as in Roman Balances ; and on the other 
Arm muft be hung on a filken Line, for fuftaining things to be weighed. Then to weigh 
any thing, you muft place the filken Line, to which the thing is hung, upon the firft Divi- 
fion of the Arm, nigheft the Point of Equilibrium ♦, and moving the Counter-weight upon 
the other Arm, 'till it makes an Equilibrium, the Point whereon it falls will fhow the Weight 
fought. M 

To know the Weight of Goods, according to any Price ; for Example, at feven Pence an 
Ounce or Pound ; place the Line, fuftaining the Goods, upon the Divifion 7 of the Arm •, 
then placing the Line, carrying the Counter- weight upon the other Arm, fo that it be in Equi- 
libria, and the Number of Divifions, from the Point of Sufpenfion to the Line fuftaining the 
Counter-weight, will give the Value of the Goods weighed. 

But for Goods that cannot be weighed, unlefs in a Scale, take a Scale of a known Weight, 
and having hung it upon a Hook to the Arm, proceed as before, and fubftract the Weight of 
the Scale. 

A Paris Pound is 16 Ounces, and is divided into 2 Marks, each of which is 8 Ounces ; 
an Ounce is fubdivided into 8 Drams, a Dram into 72 Grains, and a Grain, which is nighly 
the Weight of a Grain of Wheat, is the leaft Weight ufed. 

A Quintal weighs 100 Pounds. 

The Paris Pound compared with thofe of other Countries. 

The Pound of Avignon, Lyons, Montpelier, and Thoulouje is 13 Ounces. 

The Pound of Marfeilles and Rochelle is 19 Ounces. 

The Pound of Rouen, Befanfon, Strafburgh, and Amjierdam is 16 Ounces, like that of Paris. 

The Pound of Milan, Naples, and Venice, is 9 Ounces. 

The Pound of Meffina and Genoa is 9 4 Ounces. 

The Pound ok Florence, Leghorne, Pifa, SarragoJJa and Valence is 10 Ounces. 

The Pound of Turin and Modena is 10 ' Ounces. 

The Pound of London, Antwerp and Flanders is 14 Ounces. 

The Pound of Bafil, Berne, Franckfort and Nuremburgh is ^Ounces and 14 Grains. 

That ef Geneva is 17 Ounces.

Chap. 2. of divers Mathematical Inflrumentsi 

Conftruclion of an Inftrument for raifing of Weights. 

The Inftrument of Fig. n. confifts of two Sheaves, each of which carries eight Pullies, Fig. u. 
hollowed in to receive a Rope, which is fattened at one End to the upper Sheave •, and after 
havin" put it round all the Pullies, the other End of it muft be joined to the Power repre- 
fcnted°by the Hand. Four of the Pullies are carried upon one Axel-Tree, and four upon ano- 
ther as well in the upper Sheave as in the lower one. At the Top of the upper Sheave is a 
Kin" to hanw the Machine in a fixed Place, and at the Bottom of the other, there is another 
Ring to hang the Weights to. 

The Ufe of this Machine is to lift up or draw great Burdens, by multiplying the Force of the 
Power, which augments, in the Ratio of Unity, to double the Number of the Pullies in the 
lower Sheave ; fo that in this Inftrument, where the lower Sheave carries eight Pullies, if the 
Weight (4) weighs 16 Pounds, the Power need be but a little above one Pound to make an 
Equilibrium •, I fay, a little above, becaufe of the Friction of the Ropes and Axes. The 
Pullies of the upper Sheave do not at all contribute to the Augmentation of the Force, but 
only to facilitate the Motion in taking away the Friction of the Rope, becaufe being as Lea- 
vers of the firft kind, whofe fixed Point is in the Middle, the Power will be equal to the 
Weight •, but the Pullies below are as Leavers of the fecond Kind, whofe fixed Point is at 
one of the Ends : for their Diameter is, as it were, fixed at one End, and lifted up at the 
other -, by which each of the Pullies double their Force, fince the way moved through by the 
Power, is double to that moved through by the Weight. 

The Conftruclion of the Wind-Cane. 

This Inftrument is about three Foot long, and twelve or fifteen Lines in Thicknefs. The Fig. 12. 
Tube 3 is made of Brafs, very round, and well foldered, from 4 to 6 Lines in Diameter, 
flopped at one End a. At the Place 1 is likewife another larger Tube, fo difpofed about the 
former one, that there remains a Space 4, wherein the Air may be ciofely included. Thefe 
two Tubes ought to be joined together at one End by a circular Plate c r, exactly foldered to 
them both, for hindering the Air's getting out of the Space 4. The Piece 8 is a v alvc flop- 
ping a Hole, permitting the Air to pafs from 2 towards 1, but not to return from 1 towards 
2. There are, moreover, two Holes near the ftopped End of the Tube 3 ; thro' one of thefe 
Holes, which is marked 6, the Air would come out of the Space 4 into the Tube 3, if it 
was not hindered by a Spring- Valve opening outwardly. The other Hole is marked 5, thro' 
which there is a Communication with the outward Air, and the Air in the Cavity of the 
Tube 3 ; but yet fo, that the Air, inclofed in the Space 4, cannot come out thro' the Hole 
5, it being hindered by a little fhort Tube foldered to the Tubes 1 and 3. Laftly, the Tube 
2 reprefents the Body of a Syringe, by which as much Air as poflible may be intruded into 
the Space 4 ; after which having put a Bullet into the Cavity of the Tube 3, near the little 
Tube 5, the Cane will be charged. Now, to difcharge it, you muft pufh up the Spring- 
Valve 6, by means of a little Pin exactly filling the Cavity of the little Tube 5 ; then the 
comprefied Air, in the Cavity 4, will dilate itfelf ; and pafling thro' the Hole 6, into the Ca- 
vity of the Tube 3, will pufh the Bullet out with a great force, even to it's penetrating thro' 
a Board of an ordinary Thicknefs. 

Note, At Number 7 this Cane may be taken into two Pieces, by unferewing of it \ and the 
Handle 12 may be taken out, and inftead thereof the Head of a Cane put thereon. 

The Conftruflion of the JEoliple. 

This Inftrument is made of hammered Copper, in form of a Ball, or hollow Pear, having pjg ,« 
a Neck foldered to it, and a very little Hole drilled at the End of this Neck. 

The Air in the Ball is firft rarefied, by bringing it to the Fire ; and afterwards plunging it 
into cold Water, will condenfe the Air in it, and the Water will pafs thro' the little Hole 
into the Cavity of the Inftrument. 

Now having let about as much Water, as will fill \ of the iEolipile, get into it, if it be fet 
upon a good Fire, in the fame Situation as in the Figure, the Water, as it grows hot, will di- 
late itfelf by little and little, and throw up Vapours into the Space of Air contained between 
the Surface of the Water, and the little Hole at the End of the Neck, which, together with 
the Air, will very fwiftly crowd thro' the little Hole, and produce a Wind and violent Hiding, 
continuing 'till all the Water be evaporated, or the Heat extinguiftied. Note, This Wind has 
all the Properties of the natural Wind blowing upon the Surface of the Earth. 

The Conftruclion of four different Micro f copes. 
This is a Microfcope for viewing very minute Objects and Animals that are in Liquors. Fig. 14. 
it is compofed of two Plates of Brafs, or other Metal, about 3 Inches long, and 8 Lines 
broad, fattened together, nigh the Ends, by two Screws, 2, 2, which likewife ferve to fix the 
Hates at inch a Diitance from each other, that a Wheel may turn which has fix round Holes, 
in every of which are fiat Pieces of Glafs to put different Objects uoon, marked 3, 4, 5, &amp;c. 
Next to the Eye there is a concave Piece of Brafs 1, having a Hole 'in the Middle, in which is 
put a very imall Lens, or Ball of Glafs. This Ball ought to be very convex, and well polifhed, 

in 



o 6 The Conft ruction and Ufes Book III. 

in Order to diftinguifti minute Objects. The End of the Machine is filed in manner of a 
Handle to hold it. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument is very eafy ; if the Objects are tranfparent, as the Feet of a 
Flea, or of Flies, their Wings, the Mites in Cheefe, or other minute Animals •, as likewife 
Hairs of the Head, their Roots, &amp;c. they are put upon the Glafs Plates on the Wheel, and 
are held faff, with a little Gum-water: and to fee the little Animals in ftale Urine, Vinegar, 
in Water where there has been infufed Pepper, Coriander, Straw, Hay, or almoft any kind of 
Herbs •, little Drops thereof muft be taken up with the End of a little Glafs Pipe, and laid 
upon the aforefaid Glaffes: then the Wheel muft be turned and raifed, or deprefTed by means 
of the Screws 2, 2, and a Spring between the Plates, which ferves to keep the Wheel in any 
Situation required, in fuch manner that a little Drop may be exactly under the Lens. Things 
being thus ordered, take the Microfcope in your Hand, and having placed your Eye to the 
Concave i, over the Lens, look fleadily at the Drop in broad Day-light, or at Night by the 
Light of a Wax -Candle; at the fame time turn the Screw at the End by little and little, to 
brino- the Drop nigher, or make it further from the Lens, until the Point be found where the 
Object will be tranfparent, or the Animals fwimming in the Drop of Liquor, appear very 
large and diftinct. 

Conjlrutlion of another Microfcope. 

Fig. 15. This Microfcope is compofed of a Brafs Plate about three Inches high, and f an Inch broad, 

cut in Form of a Parallelogram, at the Bottom of which there is a Handle to hold it. The 
Place marked 1, is a little Groove drilled thro' the Middle, in the Hole of which is placed a 
Lens fattened in a little Frame ; there may be put into it Lenfes of diverfe Foci, according to 
the different Objects to be obferved. Note, That the Focus of a Glafs, is it's Diftance from 
the Object, and that Lenfes are ufed in thefe Microfcopes, whofe Foci are from half a Line 
to four Lines. 

On the Backfide of the aforefaid Plate (at the Place 2.)* is fixed a little fquare Branch of 
Brafs or Steel, carrying another Plate that Aides upon it by means of a little Box, a Spring, 
and a Screw, turned by help of a Wheel, cut into Teeth, which ferves to bring the faid Plate 
nigher to, or more diftant from that which carries the Lens. Towards the Top of the fecond 
Plate ; which has a Hole drilled in it, is alfo a Groove, in which is placed little Pieces of plain 
Glafs, and round Concaves to put Liquors on. There may be different GlafiTes put in that 
Groove for viewing different Objects. Laftly, Obferve that all the Objects anfwer to the 
Center of the Lens, and that there muft be adjufted on the other Side of the Plate a little 
Tube (marked 3.) of Brafs, about an Inch Diameter, and one or two long, whofe Center 
muff, very exactly anfwer to the Center of the Lenfes. It has been found that with fuch a 
Tube, thefe Microfcopes will have much more effect upon tranfparent Objects, than without 
it. The Circulation of the Blood may pretty diftinctly be obferved in the Tails of little Fifties 
by this Microfcope, which is, in my Opinion, the moft commodious of any. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument is very eafy ; for having placed the Object over-againft the 
Center of the Lens, move it backwards and forwards by means of the Screw, 'till it be feen 
very diftinctly. 

Conjlrutlion of afingle Glafs Microfcope. 

Fig. 16. The little Inftrument of Fig. 16. is a Microfcope commodious enough, compofed of a 

Branch of Brafs, or other Metal, having a Motion towards the Top, for putting it into the 
Situation a$per Fig. The Piece, at the End, carries a very convex Lens, magnifying the Object 
very much : this Branch is fcrewed into a little Box 5, bored through the Bottom. The 
Piece 4, is two Springs faftened to one another in the Middle with a Rivet, to give it a Mo- 
tion defired. The Branch which carries the Lens, is put through one of the Springs ; and 
through the other there is put a little Branch, carrying at one End the Piece 2, which is 
white on one Side, and black on the other, for different Objects. The other End 3, is a 
little kind of Pincer, which opens by prefllng two little Buttons ; it ferves to hold little Ani- 
mals, or other Bodies. The Foot 5, is about 1 4. Inch in Diameter, the Branch fcrews into 
it, in order to take to pieces the Inftrument. 

The Ufe of it is very eafy, for the Objects being placed upon the little round Piece, or at 
the End of the Pincer, you muft bring the Lens towards them, by Aiding the Spring along 
the Branch, 'till the Objects be feen very diftinct. 

There may likewife be difcovered with this Microfcope, the Animals which are in Liquors, 
by putting a fiat Glafs in the Place of the little round Piece 2, which unferews. 

Conflruclion of a Three -Glafs Microfcope. 

Fig. 17. This Inftrument is compofed of three Glaffes, viz. the Eye Glafs 3, the Middle Glafs 4, 

and the Object Lens 5. There is a Cover fcrewed on at the Top to preferve the Eye Glafs 
from Duft : thefe three Glaffes are fet in wooden Circles, and fcrewed into their Places, for 
eafier taking them out to cleanfe. The Eye Glafs, and the Middle one, are placed at the 
Ends of a Tube of Parchment, exactly entering into the outward Tube, in order to lengthen 
the Microfcope, and place it at it's exact Point, according to a Line drawn round about the 

afore- 



Chap. 2. of divers Mathematical Inftruments, 97 

•iorefaid Tube. To have this Inftrument of a reafonable Bigncfs, the focal Diftance of the 
Eye^Giafs ought to be about 20 Lines, that of the middle Glafs about 3 Inches, and placed 
about a Inches 2 Lines diftant from one another. 

The Object Lens is placed at the End of a wooden Tail-piece, glued to the End of the 
outward Tube, and is enclofed in a little Box, bored through the Bottom, which unferews in 
order to change the Object Lenfes, and put in others of different focal Diftances, which are 
commonly 2, 3, 4, and 5 Lines in Diameter, and are more or lefs convex. The Goodnefs 
of thefe Glaffes confifts in having the concave Brafs Bafons they are ground in, turned in a juft. 
Proportion to the Glaffes to be worked •, as alfo in the Motion of the Hand, and the Good- 
nefs of the Matter ufed to conftruct them, and above all in well polifhing them. Brown Free- 
fone is firft ufed to fafhion them in the Bafon, then fine Sand to fmooth them, and Tripoli 
to polifh them. I mall fay no more of the Conftruction of thefe Glaffes, M. Cherubin hav- 
ing fufliciently fpoken thereof. 

°Tht Foot 1, which ought to be pretty heavy to keep the Mifcrofcope from falling, is made 
of Brafs 4 or 5 Inches in Diameter, having a Cavity in the Middle, wherein is put a little 
Piece, white on one Side, and black on the other: black Objects are placed upon the white 
Side, and white Objects upon the black Side! 

The round Brafs Branch is fattened at the Edge of the Foot, upon which the Microfcope 
may Hide up or down, and turn round by means of the Support or double Square 2 : there 
is a Circle, or Ring, ftrongly fattened to the Support, and which very exactly encompaffes 
the outward Tube. There is alfo a Steel Spring which bears againft the Branch, and keeps 
the Inttrument in a required Situation. 

Number 6, is a little Brafs Frame, having in it a Piece of flat Glafs to lay tranfparent 
Objects upon. This Frame may Aide Up and down the Branch underneath the Microfcope, 
and is fupported by a double Square. 

Laftly, Number 7 is a convex Glafs converging the Rays of Light, coming from a Candle 
under it •, and throwing them ftrongly under the tranfparent Object on the Glafs, makes it be 
feen more diftinctly. The aforefaid Glafs is fet in a Brafs Circle, and rifes, falls, and turns 
by means of a little Arm carrying it, as the Figure fhews. 

U S E of the aforefaid Microfcope. 

To ufe this Inftrument, for Example, to obferve the Circulation of the Blood in fome Ani* 
mal 5 a live Fifh muff ' e placed upon the Glafs 6, fo that one part of the Fins of the Tail be 
exactly oppofite to the Object Glafs, and over the Ray of the Convex-Glafs in broad Daylight, 
or the Spot of the Candle, in the Night ; then place the Microfcope exactly to fuch a Point, 
and you will fee the Blood rife, defcend, or circulate. 

Number 9, is a little Piece of Lead hollowed, to keep the Fifh from any how ftirring to 
hinder the Experiment. 

Liquors may alfo by this Microfcope be very well examined ; for if you put a little Drop of 
Vinegar upon the Glafs juft over the bright Spot-, the little Animals in it will very diftinctly 
be obferved. The fame may be obferved of Water in which Pepper or Barley has been in- 
fufed, &amp;c. as alfo the Eels and other little Animals obferved in ftanding Water. 

A Drop of Blood may be obferved by putting it hot over the Speck of the Candle, upon 
the Glafs •, after which it's Serofity, and little Globules of a reddifti Colour, may be difcovered 
therein. 

The beft way to get a Drop of Blood is to tie a Thread about one's Thumb, and then prick 
it with a Needle. 

The beft way to put Liquors upon the Glafs, is by taking a Drop of them up with the 
fmall End of a little Glafs Tube ; and then blowing foftly at the other End, will make the Li* 
quor defcend and drop upon the Glafs. 

To get a great Number of little Eels in a fmall Quantity of Liquor •, the Liquor muft be 
put into a very narrow-necked Bottle, and always kept full ; for by this means, the Animals 
coming to the Top to get Air, may be fucked into a little Tube in greater Numbers, than if 
the Neck of the Bottle was wider. 

The Eyes of Flies, Ants, Lice, Fleas, and Mites, are put in the Middle of the Foot of 
the Microfcope, as alfo Sand, Salt, &amp;c. to examine their Colours and Qualities ; always ob- 
ferving to lay black Objeds upon the white, and white Objects upon the black Side. 

I fuppofe here that the Microfcope Glaffes are well worked, and placed in their Foci. 
Note alfo, that the fhorter the Focus of an Object Glafs is, the greater will the Object ap- 
pear, but not altogether fo diftinct.

^??Js&gt; TAFFS are made of hard Wood, 2 or 3 Foot long, cut pecked at 



one End, upon which are put pointed Caps of Iron, to make them go 
eafier into the Ground. There are fometimes longer ones made, in or- 
der to be feen at a great diftance. 

Lines ought to be of good Packthread, or Whipcord, well twitted, 
and of a convenient Thicknefs, that they may not eafily ftretch. 

The Toife, or Fathom, is a round Staff 6 Foot long, divided into 
Feet by little Rings, or Brafs Pins ; the laft Foot being divided into \i 
Inches, likewife diftinguifhed by little Brafs Pins. 

There are Toifes that may be taken into 2, 3, or 4 Pieces, by means of Ferils and Brafs 
Screws at the End of each Piece. 

There are alfo two Brafs or Steel Ferils, put upon each End of the Toife, to preferve it's 
Length. 

The Chain is compofed of feveral Pieces of thick Iron or Brafs Wire, bent at the Ends, 
each of which is a Foot long, and are joined together with little Rings. 

Chains are commonly a Perch, or elfe 4 or 5 Toifes in Length, diftinguifhed by a great 
Ring from Toife to Toife. Thefe fort of Chains are very commodious, becaufe they will 
not entangle themfelves, as thofc will that are made with little Iron Rings. 

In the Year 1668, there was placed a new Toife for a Standard, at the Foot of the Stairs 
of the Grand Chatelet at Paris y for having recourfe to in cafe of Keed. 

We have faid that a Toife in Length contains 6 Feet, and each Foot 12 Inches. 
A fquare Toife contains 36 fquare Feet, and a fquare Foot 144 Inches ; becaufe 6 times 6 
is 36, arid 12 times 12 is 144. 

A Cubick

Chap. I. of Staffs, Lines, the Fathom, and Chain. on 

A Cubick Toife contains 216 Cubick Feet, and a Cubick Foot 1728 Cubick Inches • be- 
caufe the Cube of 6 is 216, and the Cube of 12 is 1728. 

The Length of a Perch is not determined. 

That of Paris is 3 Toifes, or 18 Feet j in other Countries it is 20, 22, and 24 Feet. 

The Perch, ufed in France, to meafure Waters and Forefts, according to the laft Regula- 
tion, is 22 Feet long, and confequently a fquare Perch is 484 fquare Feet. 

The Arpent is a fuperficial Meafure, ufed to meafure Ground or Woods. 

The Arpentof Paris, and the adjacent Parts, contains 100 fquare Perches, or 900 Toifes; 
the Side of which muft confequently be 10 Perches, or 30 Toifes. 

A League is a Meafure for High- ways, or great Diftances ; it's Length is not determined, 
being different in different Countries. 

It is reckoned from the Gate of Paris, nigh the Grand Chatekt, to the Gate of the Church 
of St Dennis, 2 Leagues, each of which is 2200 Toifes. 

The Gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences have found, that a Degree of a great Circle 
of the Earth contains 57060 Toifes ; and giving 25 Leagues to a Degree, each League will 
contain 2282 Toifes. 

A Sea-League is greater, for there goes but 20 to make a Degree j therefore it contains 
about 3000 Toiles. 

The Italians reckon by Miles, each of which contains 1000 Geometrical Paces. 

A Geometrical Pace is five of the antient Feet, one of which the antient Roman Palm is three 
quarters, which may be efteemed about 11 of our Inches; and confequently an Italian Mile 
contains ab/vjt 769 of our Toifes. 

The Germans alfo reckon by the Mile, but they are much greater than the Italian Miles 1 
for one or them contains 3626 Toifes. 

They count by Leagues in Spain, one of which contains 2863 Toifes, 20 of which exa&amp;ly 
make one 7 erreilrial Degree, ' ' 

The fame may be laid of the Englijh and Butch Leagues. 

U S E I. To draw a right Line thro' two Points given upon the Ground, and produce it 

to any required Length. 

Plant a Staff upon each of the given Points, very upright, and having drained a Line from 
one Staff to the other ; by that Line, as a Guide, draw a Line upon the Ground. 

That right Line may be continued by planting a third Staff, lb that by placing the Eye to 
the Edge of the firft, the Edges of the two others may be but juft feen j and again, the Line 
may be continued, by taking that Staff, which was the firft, and placing it as a third, fcV. 

USE II. To meafure a right Line upon the Ground. 

When a long Line upon the Ground is to be meafured, Precaution muft be ufed that we 

do not m.ftake and be obliged to begin again. To do which, two Men muft each of 

them have a Toife ; the firft having laid down his, muft not lift it up, 'till the fecond 

has placed ms at the End of the firft Man's Toife. The firft Man having lifted up his Toife, 

Tr A «° Unt *' , a r d Wl ? en he haS a S ain laid his down t0 the End of the fecond Man's 
the fecond Man muft lift up his, and count 2. In thus continuing on to the End, and in or- 
der to lay the 1 oifes in a right Line, there muft be placed two Staffs, at a Diftance before 

d Tei to ofk at ; re is but one ' the Toifes cannot be fo m,1 y laid in a r, S ht Line 

To fpare Time and Pains you ought to have a Chain of 30 Feet, or 5 Toifes long, with 
a Ring at each End carried by two Men, the firft of which carries feveral Staffs. When the 
Uiain is well extended on the right Line to be meafured, the foremoft Man muft place a Staff 

for the wh ? ll ' V°n - G Knd n tHat thC hinder Ma " "^ kn0W where the Chai " «"kd J

to each End of your Line* and divide their Di (lance into two equal Parts, which may be done 
by folding a Line as long as the Diftance A B j plant a Staff in the middle C, and the Line 
CF will be perpendicular to the Line AB. 

USE V. To draw a Line parallel to another ', at a given Bijlance from it. 

fig. 4. Let the given Line be A B, and it is required to draw a Line parallel to it at the Diftance 

of 4 Toifes. 

Raife (by Ufe 3.) two Perpendiculars, each of 4 Toifes, upon the Points A, B-, and upon 
the Points C, D plant two Staffs ; by which draw the Line C D, which will be parallel 
to AB. 

X3 S E VI. To make an Angle on the Ground, at the End of a Linei equal to an Angle 

given* 

Fig. 5. Let A B C be the given Angle (which fuppofe is drawn upon Paper). 

About the Point B, as a Center* defcribe uport the Paper the Arc A C, and draw the 
right Line A C, which will be the Chord of the faid Arc. Meafure with a Scale, or the Line 
of equal Parts of the Sector, the Length of one of the equal Legs A B, or B C of the faid 
Angle; likewife meafure, with the fame Scale, the Length of the Chord AC ; which, fof 
Example, fuppofe 36 of thofe equal Parts, whereof the Leg AB contains 30. 

Now let there be upon the Ground a right Line, as B C, to which it is required to draw 
another Line FB, making an Angle with BC equal to the propofed one. Plant a Staff in the 
Point B, and having meafured 30 Feet, or 5 Toifes, on the Line B C, there plant a Staff, 
as D ; then take two Lines, one of 30 Feet long, which faften to the Staff B, and the other 
36 Feet, which likewife faften to the Staff D : Draw the Lines tight, and make their Ends 
meet in the Point F, where again plant a Staff, from which draw the Line F B ; which will 
form, at the Point B, the Angle F B C equal to the propofed one ABC. 

USE VII. To draw upon Paper an Angle, equal to a given one upon the Ground. 

fig. j. This Problem is the Converfe of the former. 

Let the given Angle upon the Ground be F B C •, meafure 30 Feet, or 5 Toifes, from B 
towards C, at the End of which plant the Staff D ; meafure likewife 30 Feet from B towards 
F, and there plant another Staff; meafure alfo the Diftance of the Staffs F, D, which fup- 
pofe will be 36 Feet (as in Ufe VI.). 

Now let B C be a Line upon the Paper ; then about the Point B, as a Center, and with a 
Length of 30 equal Parts (taken from a Scale) defcribe the Arc A C ; and take 36 of the 
fame Parts, and lay them off from the Point C, upon the Arc C A, and a Line drawn from 
B to A will make, with the Line B C, the Angle required. 

If, moreover, the Quantity of the aforefaid Angle be defired, it will be' found, by the 
Protractor, fomething lefs than 64 Degrees. 

The Quantity of Angles (whofe Chords are known), in Degrees and Minutes, may more 
exa&lt;ftly be known by the following Table, which is calculated for Angles, always contained 
under equal Sides of 30 Feet each. 

The Ufe of the faid Table is very eafy for finding the Quantity of any Plane Angles upon 
the Ground : for meafure 30 Feet upon each of the Lines forming an Angle, and plant a 
Staff at the End of 30 Feet upon each Line ; then meafure the Diftance between the two 
Staffs, which fuppofe to be 36 Feet (as in the preceding Example), look in the Table in the 
Column of Bafes of 36 Feet, and you will find over againft it, in the Column of Angles, 
63 Degrees, 44 Minutes, the Quantity of the faid Angle.

Note, That in the Columns of Bafes are only fet down every 2 Inches, and the Feet from 
1 to 60. By means of this Table may be eafily and exactly found the Opening and Quantity 
of any Angle •, for fuppofe your Bafe be in Length 50 Feet, 3 Inches, and the other 2 Sides 
each 30 Feet, which they muft always be. Seek 50 Feet, 2 Inches, in the Column of Bafes ; 
and againft it you will find, in the Column of Angles, 113 Deg. 28 Min. whence by making 
due Proportion with the Inches and Minutes, the Quantity of the Angle fought will be 113 
Deg. 44 Min. This Table, together with a well divided Brafs Scale, may be ufed in meafur- 
ing or laying off Angles upon Paper, with as much Exactnefs as Lines will do them upon the 
Ground ; becaufe the Sides of equi-angled Triangles are proportional to each other. 

This Method of meafuring plane Angles, may likewife ferve to make Defigns of Fortifica- 
tion, both regular and irregular, to find the Quantities of Angles, as well of Baftions as of 
the Polygon, formed by the Concourfe of the Lines of the Bafes, or exterior Sides, either up- 
on Paper or the Ground. 

To draw Angles by this Table, feek for the Degrees and Minutes you defign an Angle to 
confift of, which, for Example, fuppofe 54 Deg. 34 Min. and againft them, in the Column 
of Bafes, is the Number of Feet and Inches correfponding thereto, viz. 27 Feet, 6 Inches ; 
which is the Length of the Bafe of the Angle, each of the other Sides of which is 30 Feet, 
and fo of others. 



D d 



USE 



I o 2 The ConjiruEiion and Ufes Book IV, 

USE VIII. To take the Plane, or Plot of a Place within it. 

F,-g. 6. Let the Place whofe Plan is required, be A B C D E. 

Firft, make a Figure upon your Paper, fomething like the Plan to be taken, and after hav- 
ing meafured with a Toife the Sides A B, B C, C D, D E, and E A, write the Lengths found 
upon each of their correfponding Lines on the Paper ; then inftead of meafuring the Angles 
made by the Sides, meafure the Diagonals AD, BD, which write down in your Book, and 
the Figure will be reduced into three Triangles, whofe Sides are all known, becaufe they 
have been actually meafured. Then the Figure muft be drawn neat in your Book by means 
of a Scale of equal Parts. 

Note, Of all the Ways to take the Planes of Places, that of taking it within is the beft. 

USE IX. To take the Plot of any Place (as a Wood, or marfhy Ground) by meafuring 

round about it. 

jr,V - Firft draw a rough Sketch of the Figure in your Field-Book : if it takes not too much time 

in going round the Place •, then meafure with a Toife, or Chain, all the Sides encompaffing 
the Figure propofed, and fet the Numbers found upon each correfpondent Line, in your 
Book •, but for the Angles, you muft meafure them as follows. 

To meafure, for Example, the Angle E F G, produce the Side E F, 5 Toifes, and plant 
a Staff at the End K •, produce alfo the Side G F, the Length of 5 Toifes, and plant a Staff 
at the End L. Meafure the Diftance LK, and fuppofing it 6 Toifes, 4 Feet, that is 40 Feet, 
fet it down upon the Line L K in your Book, by which means the three Sides of the Ifofceles 
Triangle L F K will be had -, and confequently the Angle LFK, may be known by the afore- 
mentioned Table, or otherwife. Now the aforefaid Angle is equal to it's oppofite one E FG, 
and if you feek 40 Feet in the Column of Bafes, the Angle will be found 83 Deg. 37 Min. 

In the fame manner may the Angle F G H, or any other of the propofed Figure, be mea- 
fured : or elfe thus, Produce the Side HG, the Length of 5 Toifes, to N, where plant a 
Staff; make likewile G M, 5 Toifes. Meafure the Diftance M N, which fuppofe, for Ex- 
ample, 6 Toifes, 2 Feet, or 38 Feet, which write upon the Line M N in your Book. 

This Number fought in the Column of Bafes, correfponds to 78 Deg. 35 Min. for the 
txterior Angle M G N, whofe Complement 101 Deg. 25 Min. is the Quantity of the 
Angle FGH. 

Then the Figure in your Field-Book muft be drawn neat by means of a Scale of equal 
Parts, as well to denote the Lengths of the Sides, as the Bafes of all the Angles, which may 
exactly be had without the Trouble of taking their Quantities in Degrees and Minutes. 

U S E X. To draw any regular Polygon upon a given Line on the Ground. 

Fig. 8. Let, for Example, the given Line be A B, upon which it is required to make an equila- 

teral Triangle. 

Meafure 30 Feet upon the Line A B, from A to D, where plant a Staff: then take 2 
Lines, each 30 Feet long, one of which faften to the Staff D, and the other to the Staff A, 
and ftretch them 'till their Ends join in the Point C, where plant another Staff. 

Make the fame Operation at the other End of the given Line, and produce the Lines AC, 
and B F, 'till they meet in the Point E, and form the equilateral Triangle A E B required. 
Fig. 9. If a Square be to be made upon the given Line A B, raife upon each End A and B, a 

Perpendicular (by USE HI.). 

Then make each of thofe Perpendiculars equal to the Line given, plant Staffs at their 
Ends C and D, and draw the Line CD, which will compleat the Square propofed. 
Fig. 10. If a Pentagon is required to be drawn upon the given Line A B : 

You will find that the Angles formed by the Sides of a Pentagon, are each 108 Degrees ; 
(as before has been faid, in USE 3. of the Protractor, and in the third Section, concerning 
the Line of Polygons of the Sector) ; therefore feek for, in the Table of Plane Angles, the 
Number that anfwers to 108 Degrees, or nighly approaches it, and you will find 48 Feet, 
and fomething above 6 Inches : for that Number anfwers to 107 Deg. 52 Min. which is leffer 
by 8 Min. than 108 Degrees •, whence 48 Feet, 6 i Inches, may be taken for the aforefaid 
Bafe. 

Now meafure upon the given Line, from the Point A towards B, 30 Feet, and plant a 
Staff in the Point C, where the faid Length terminates : then take 2 Lines, one 30 Feet, the 
End of which faften to the Staff A ; and the other 48 Feet, 6 4 Inches, which likewife faften 
to the Staff C j (train the Lines equally, 'till they join in the Point E, where plant a Staff, 
and by that means will be had an Angle of 108 Degrees: then produce the Line A E, 'till it 
be equal to A B ;• make the fame Operation at the End B of the given Line, by which means 
three Sides AB, AG, B D, of the required Pentagon will be had, which afterwards may be 
compleated by the fame Method. 

If the Pentagon be not too big, it may be compleated by means of 2 Lines, each equal to 
the given Side, one faftened to the Staff D, and the other to the Staff G ; for if they are 
equally (trained, they will form the two other Sides of the Polygon, by meeting in the 
Point H. 

Any 



Chap, io of Staffs ) Lines ; the Fathom , and Chairt. 103 

Any other regular or irregular Polygon, by the fame Method, may be made upon the 
Ground, by feeking in the before-mentioned Table, the Number of Feet and Inches anfwer- 
ing to the Angle of the Polygon to be drawn. 

USE XI. To find the Dijlance of two Objects, inaccejfible in refpecl of each other. 

The Diftance, for Example, from the Tower A, to the Windmill B, is required. Fig. ii; 

Plant the Staff C in fome Place from whence it may be eafy to meafure the Diftance in a 
right Line from it to the Places A and B. 

Meafure thcfe Diftances exactly, as for Example, from C to A* which fuppofe 54 Toifes ; 
then produce the Line A C to D, likewife 54 Toifes : meafure alfo the Line B C, which fup- 
pofe 37 Toifes, and produce it to E, fo that C E may be 37 Toifes likewife j by which means 
the Triangle CDE, will be formed equal and fimilar to the Triangle ABC, and confe- 
quently the Diftance D E will be equal to the propofed inaccefilble Diftance from B to A. 

USE XII. To find the Dijlance of two Objetls, one of which is inaccejfible. 

Let it be propofed, for Example, to find the Breadth A B of a River : being at one of it*s Tig. it. 
Sides A, plant there a Staff AC, 4 or 5 Feet high, and very upright •, make a Slit towards 
the Top of the Staff, in which put a very ftraight Piece of Steel or Brafs (that may flide up 
and down), about 3 Inches long, which mull be flipped up or down, 'till the Point B, on the 
other Side of the River be feen along it •, afterwards turn the Staff, and look along (keeping 
the aforefaid Piece of Brafs in the fame Pofition) the Side of the River upon level Ground* 
'till you fee the Point D, where the vifual Rays terminate. The Diftance AD meafured 
with a Chain, will give the Breadth of the River, to which it is equal. 

This Propofition, as fimple as it is, may ferve to know what Length Timber muft be of* 
to make Bridges over Ditches or Rivers. 

USE XIII. To draw upon the Ground a right Line from the Point A, to the Point Bj hi' 
tween which there is a Building, or other Obftacle, that hinders the continuing of it. 

Find, upon very level Ground, a third Point, as C, from which you may fee Staffs planted Fig. 13. 
in the Points A and B ; then meafure exactly the Diftance from C to A, and from C to B : this 
being done, take the Half, Third, or any other Part of each of thofe Lines, whereat plant 
Staffs, as in D bifecting C B, and in E bifecting C A ; then draw a right Line from D to E, 
which produce as is neceffary, and draw a Parallel to it pafling by the Points A and B, by 
means of Staffs planted betweent the Point A and the Houfe, as alfo between the Houfe and 
the Point B, which will fhew the Direction from A to B. 

USE XIV. // is required to cut a Pajfage thro" a Hill from the Point A to B. 

Draw on one Side of the Hill a right Line, as DC, and on the other Side another right Fig. 14; 
Line, as E T, parallel to C D ; then let fall from the Point A, to the Line C D, the Perpen- 
dicular A G ; and in fome other Point beyond the Hill, draw another Perpendicular, as CH* 
equal to A G. 

Again ; from the Point B, let fall upon the Line E F the Perpendicular B I ; and from 
fome other Point beyond the Hill, draw another Perpendicular to the fame Line, as L M, 
equal to B I, fo that the Diftance I L, may be equal to C G •, then draw a right Line from 
the Staff H, to the Staff M (and produce it as far as is neceffary), which will be parallel to 
'the Paifage to be made from A to B ; therefore any Number of Staffs may be planted at an 
equal Diftance to that Parallel H M on both Sides the Hill, as O, P, Q^ which will ferve as 
a Guide to pierce the Hill thro' from A to B. 

I (hall again mention the Ufe of the aforefaid Inftruments, in the little Treatifc of Fortifi- 
cation, hereafter laid down. 



CHAP. II. 

Of the Defer tption and Ufe of the Survey ing-Cr of s. 

THE Surveying-Crofs is a Brafs Circle of a good Thicknefs, and 4, 5, or 6 Inches Fig. 15. 
Diameter. It is divided into 4 equal Parts, by two Lines cutting one another at right 
Angles in the Center. At the four Ends of thefe Lines, and in the Middle of the Limb, 
there are fixed four ftrong Sights well riveted in fquare Holes, and very perpendicularly flit 
over the aforefaid Lines, having Holes below each Slit, for better difcovering of diftant Ob- 
jects : the Circle is hollowed to render it more light. 

• Under- 



IO w The ConjlruSiion and Ufes Book IV. 

Fig. 1 6. Underneath, and at the Center of the Inftrument, there ought to be fcrewed on a Ferrel, 

ferving to fuftain the Crofs upon it's Staff of 4 or 5 Feet long, according to the Height of 
the Obferver's Eye. This Staff muft be furnifhed with an Iron Point, to go into the Ground 

the better. 

All the Exactnefs of this Inftrument confifts in having it's Sights well flit at right Angles, 
which may be known by looking at an Object thro' two Sights, and another Object thro' 
two other Sights : then the Crofs muft be exactly turned upon it's Staff, and you muft look at 
the fame Objects through the oppofite Sights ; if they are very exactly in the Direction of the 
Slits, it is a fign the Inftrument is very juft. 

To avoid breaking or damaging the Crofs, the Staff muft firft be put in the Ground, and 
when it is well fixed, the Crofs muft be fcrewed upon it. 

Thefe kinds of Croftes fometimes are made with eight Sights, in the fame manner as the 
aforefaid one, and ferve to take Angles of 45 Degrees ; as alio for "Gardeners to plant Rows 
of Trees by. 

U S E I. To take the Plot and Area of a Field within it. 

Fig. iy. Let the Field propofed be A BCD E, and having placed at all the Angles Staffs, or Poles 

very upright, exactly meafure the Line AC (in the manner we have already laid down, or 
any other at pleafure) then make a Memorial, or rough Draught, fomewhat reprefenting the 
Field propofed, on which write all the Dimenfions of the Parts of the Line AC, and ot Per- 
pendiculars drawn from the Angles to the Line A C. If, for Example, you begin from the 
Staff A, find the Point F in the Line AC, upon which the Perpendicular EF falls: then 
meafure the Lines A F and E F, and fet down their Lengths upon their correfpondent Lines 
in your Memorial. 

Now to find the Point F, plant feveral Staffs at pleafure in the Line AC; as alfo the Foot 
of your Crofs in the fame Line, in fuch a manner that you may difcover thro' two oppofite 
Sights, two of thofe Staffs, and thro' the other two Sights (which make right Angles with 
the two firft ones), you may fee the Staff E. But if in this Station the Staff E cannot be 
feen, remove the Inftrument backwards or forwards, 'till the Lines A F, E F, make a right 
Angle in the Point F,- by which means the Plot of the Triangle A F E will be had. 

In the fame manner may the Point H be found, where the Perpendicular DH falls, whofe 
Length, together with that of G F, muft be fet down in your Memorial, in order to have the 
Plot of the Trapezium E F H D. Again, Meafure H C making a right Angle with H D, and 
the Plot of the Triangle DH C will be had. 

Having likewife meafured the whole Line A C, there is no more to do but find the Point 
G, where the Perpendicular B G falls ; and proceeding as before, the Plot of the Triangle 
ABC may be had, and confequently the Plot of the whole Field A B C D E. The Area of 
the Field will likewife be had, by adding the Triangles and Trapeziums together, which may 
eafily be done by the Rules of Planometry, in the following manner : 

Suppofe, for Example, A F to be 7 Toifes, and the Perpendicular E F 10 ; multiply 7 by 
10, and the Product is 70, half of which is 35, the Area of the Triangle AFE. 

If moreover the Line FH be 14 Toifes, and the Perpendicular HD 12, add 12 to 10 
(which is the Perpendicular F E), the Sum will be 22, half of which being 1 1, multiplied by 
14, will give 154 fquare Toifes, for the Area of the Trapezium E F H D •, and if the Line 
H C is 8 Toifes, multiplying 8 by 12, the Product is 96, whofe half 48, will be the Area of 
the Triangle C H D. 

The whole Line AC is 29 Toifes, and the Perpendicular BG 10; whence the Product: is 
290, whofe half 145, is the Area of the Triangle ABC. Finally, adding together 35, 154, 
48, and 145, the Sum 382, will be the Number of fquare Toifes contained in the Field 
ABCDE.

Fig. 18. Let the Morafs E F G H I be propofed: Set up Staves at all the Angles, fo made as to 

include the Morafs within a Rectangle, which meafure •, then fubftract the Triangles and 
Trapezia included between the Sides of the Morafs, and the Sides of the Rectangle, from the 
faid Rectangle, and the Area of the propofed Morafs will be had. 

If, for Example, you begin at the Staff E, produce by help of the Crofs the Line E F, as 
far as is neceffary, to which, from the Point G, let fall the Perpendicular GK; fet up a Staff 
at K, and produce KG to L, to which, from the Point H, draw the Perpendicular L H, 
which likewife produce as far as is neceffary: afterwards draw from the Staff E, to the Line 
HL, produced, the Perpendicular E M : whence the Rectangle E MLK will be had, whofe 
Sides muft be meafured with a Chain or Toife. 

Suppofe, for Example, the Line E K, or it's Parallel M L (which ought to be equal to it) 
is 25 Toifes, and the Line E M, or it's Parallel, 10 Toifes ; multiplying thefe two Numbers 
by one another, there will arife 350 fquare Toifes for the Area of the Rectangle E M L K : 
but if F K be 5 Toifes, and GK 4, by multiplying 4 by 5, the Product is 20, whofe half 10 
Toifes, is the Area of the Triangle FKG. The Line GL, being 6 Toifes, and H L 4, the 
Product of 4 by 6 is 24, whofe half 12 is the Area of the Triangle G L H, 

After- 



Chap. 3. of clivers Inflruments to take Angles. 105 

Afterwards a Point muft be found in the Line HM, where a Perpendicular drawn from 
the Staff 1 falls, which forms a Triangle and a Trapezium ; fo that if the Diftance H N be 24 
Toifes, and the Perpendicular N I 4 Toifes, 24 by 4 gives 96, whofe half 48, is the Area of 
the Triangle H N I. Laftly, N M being 7 Toifes, M E 10, and it's Parallel N I 4 Toifes, 
adding 10 to 4, the Sum will be 14, whofe half 7, multiplied by 7, produces 49 for the Area 
of the°Trapezium E M N I. 

Therefore adding together the Areas of the three Triangles, and that of the Trapezium, 
there will be had 119 Toifes, which taken from 350, the Area of the Rectangle, and there 
remains 231, the Area of the propofed Morafs. The fame may be done with any other 
Figure. Thefe two Ufes are enough to fhew how Surveyors ufe their Instruments for mea- 
funng and taking the Plot of any Piece of Ground. 

CHAP. III. 

Of the ConfiruEiion and Ufes of divers Inflruments to take Angles. 

THERE are feveral Sorts of Instruments to take Angles, but the belt and mod in ufe, 
are thofe whofe Defcription we are now going to give. 

The Inftrument Aj is compofed of two Rules very equal in breadth, for the Infides of FJ g- A. 
them muft be parallel to their Outfides ; their Breadth is about an Inch, and their Length a 
Foot or more. Thofe two Rulers are equally rounded at the Top, and faftened to one an- 
other by means of a Rivet artificially turned, fo that the Inftrument may eafily open and fhut. 
When an Angle is taken with it, the Center of a Protractor muft be put to the Place where 
the two Rulers join each other, and the Degrees cut by the Edge, will fhow the Quantity 
of the Angle ; or elfe the Angle which the two Rulers make, is drawn upon Paper, and then 
it is meafured with a Protractor. 

The Inftrument B, is made like the precedent one, only there are two Steel Points at the Fig. B. 
Ends, in order for it to ferve as a Pair of Compaffes. 

The Inftrument C, is different from the others, becaufe it fhews the Quantities of Angles Fi S- C» 
without a Protractor. 

It is compofed of 2 Brafs Rulers of equal Breadth and parallel, about 2 Feet long, and 2 
or 3 Inches thick, joined together by a very round Rivet : it has befides a Circle divided in- 
to 360 Degrees at the End of one of the Rulers, and a little Index fixed to the Rivet, which 
Ihews the Number of Degrees the 2 Rulers contain between them. I fhall not here fhew 
how to divide the Circle, having fufficiently fpoken of it in the Construction of the Protractor ; 
only note, that the Degrees are always reckoned from the Middle of the Rule, where the 
Center is. 

There are thefe Sorts of Inflruments made by dividing a Circle upon the under Ruler, and 
filing the upper one like the Head of a Sector, that thereby the Degrees of the Opening of 
the Legs may be known, by means of the two Shoulders of the upper Leg. 

To meafure a faliant Angle with any one of the three Recipient-Angles, apply the Infides 
of the two Rulers, to the Lines forming the Angle ; and to meafure a rentrant Angle, apply 
the Outfides of the fame Rulers to the Lines forming the Angle. 

The Inftrument D, is made of 4 Brafs Rules, equal in Breadth, joined together by 4 round Fig. D. 
Rivets, forming an equilateral Parallelogram. 

At the End of one of the Rules there is a Semi-circle, divided into 1 80 Degrees. The other 
Branch pafTing upon the Semi-circle, is continued to the Divifions of the Semi-circle, in order 
to fhew the Quantities of Angles. 

The faid Rules are made one or two Feet long, 8 or 10 Lines broad, and of a convenient 
Thicknefs; they ought to be drilled very equal in Length, namely, that where the Center 
of the Semi-circle is (marked 2.) and at the other End in the Point 1. That which ferves for 
an Index, ought to be drilled in the Points 2 and 3. And laftly, The two other Rules in the 
Point 4. The Rule ferving for an Index, muft be faftened to the Center of the Semi-circle ; 
and the two other Rules, which are of equal Length, muft be faftened underneath the two 
others, all of them fo as their Motion may be very uniform. 

When a faliant Angle is to be meafured with this Inftrument, the 2 equal Rules muft be 
put underneath the 2 others, fo that the End 4 be underneath 2, and thereby the 4 Rules 
make but 2 to encompafs the Angle : but when a rentrant Angle is to be meafured, the two 
Rules muft be drawn out (as per Figure), and applied to the Corner of the Angle-, and fince 
in every Parallelogram the oppofite Angles are equal, the Degrees of the Angle may be known 
by the Semi-circle.

and the flanquant Angle of the propofed Baftion, by applying it horizontally, in fuch manner 
that one of the Rules may be in" the Direction of the faid Courtine, and the other in the Di- 
rection of the Flank ; and -having found the Quantity of it in Degrees, frt it down upon a 
little Arc in your Memorial ; then meafure the Flank ED, which fet down upon the Line 
e d in your Memorial. Again, apply the Rules of your Instrument to the faliant Angle D 4 
and fet down it's Quantity upon a little Arc ■, meafure the Length of the left Face C D, take 
the Quantity of the flanquant Angle C, and of. all the other Angles of the Baftion, as likewife 
the Length of the Faces and Flanks t after which, by help of a Scale, the Plan of the Baftion 
may be drawn neat. 

But fince it often happens that thefe Angles, which are commonly made of Free-Stone, are 
not well cut, by the Negligence of Workmen, who make them either too acute or obtufe ; 
to remedy this, there muft be a long Rule horizontally applied to each Wall, whofe Direction 
is aood, tho' the Angles are not ; and putting the Legs of the Inftrument level upon thofe 
two Rules, the Angle to be meafured may be more exactly had.

CHAP. IV. 

Of the ConftruEiion a?id Ufe of the Theodolite. 

Plate 12. f | '^ HIS Inftrument is made of Wood, Brafs, or any other folid Matter, commonly circu- 
p ig A x l ar &gt; anc * about one Foot in Diameter. In the Center of this Inftrument is fet upright a 

little Brafs Cylinder, or Pivot, about which an Index turns, furnifhed with two Sights, or a 
Telefcope, having a right Line, called The Fiducial Line, exactly anfwering to the Center of 
the aforefaid little Cylinder, whofe Top ought to be cut into a Screw, for receiving a Nut to 
fallen the Index, upon which is fixed a fmall Compafs for finding the Meridian Line. 

The Limb of the Theodolite is a Circle of fuch a Thicknefs, as to contain about fix round 
Pieces of Pafteboard within it (of which we are going to fpeak), and of fuch a Breadth as to 
receive the Divifions of 360 Degrees, and fometimes of every fifth Minute. 

There are feveral round Pieces of Pafteboard, of the Bignefs of the Theodolite, pierced 
thro' the Middle with a round Hole, exactly to fit the Pivot-, fo that the Pivot may be put 
thro' each of the aforefaid Holes in the Pieces of Pafteboard, and the upper Pafteboard may 
have the Index moving upon it. This upper Pafteboard may be fixed at pleafure, by means 
of a little Point faftened to the Limb of the Inftrument, and entering a little way into the 
Pafteboard. There is commonly drawn with Ink, upon each of thefe Pafteboards, a Radius 
or Semidiameter, ferving for a Station-Line. 

Underneath the Theodolite is faftened a Ball and Socket, reprefentcd by the Figure D, 
which is a Brafs Ball enclofed between two Shells of the fame Metal, that may be more or 
lefs opened by means of a Screw, and a Socket G, in which goes the Head of a three-legged 
Staff", of which more by and by. 

Fig. A, reprefents the Inftrument put together. We now proceed to fhew the Construction 
of the Pieces compofiug it, in beginning with the Divifion of it's Limb. 

Firft, Draw upon the Limb two or three concentrick Circles, to contain the Degrees, and 
the Numbers fet at every tenth Degree ; then divide one of thefe Circumferences into four 
very equal Parts, each of which will be 90 Degrees ; and dividing each of thefe four Parts 
into 9 more, the Circumference will be divided into every tenth Degree. Again, each of 
thefe laft Parts being divided by 2, and each of thofe arifing into 5 equal Parts, the whole 
Circumference will be divided into 360 Degrees. This being done, you muft draw the Lines 
of thefe Divifions upon their convenient Arcs, by means of a Ruler moving about the Center. 
Afterwards Numbers muft be fet to every tenth Degree, beginning from the Fiducial Line, 
which is that whereon the two fixed Sights or Telefcope is faftened. 

A Theodolite thus divided is of much greater Ufe than thofe whofe Limbs are not divid- 
ed ; for it may ferve exactly to take the Plots of Places, and meafure inaccefiible Diftances 
by Trigonometry.

The Figures B reprefent the Sights which are placed upon different Inftruments ; that to 
which is placed the Eye, hath a long (trait Slit, which ought to be very perpendicular, made 
with a fine Saw \ and that which is turned towards the Object, hath a fquare Hole, fo large, 
that the adjacent Parts of a diftant Object may be perceived thro' it: And along the Middle 
of this Hole is drained a very fine Gut, in order to vertically cut Objects, when they are per* 
ceived thro' the Slit of the other Sight. But that the Eye may be indifferently placed at any 
one of the two Sights at pleafure, fo that Objects may be as well perceived thro' the Sights 
on one Side the Inftrument, on which they are placed, as on the other ; there is made in each 
Sio-ht a fquare Hole and a Slit, the Hole in one Sight being below the Slit, and in the other 
Sio-ht above it, as the little Figures fhew. Thefe Sights ought to be exactly placed on the 
Extremes, and in the fiducial Line, as well of Inftruments as Indexes, and are faftened in 
little fquare Holes with Nuts underneath, or elfe by means of Screws, according as the Place 
they are fattened on requires. 

The little Figure C reprefents the aforefaid Cylinder, or Pivot, with it's Nut, for joining 
the Index to the Theodolite ; thofe of Semicircles, and other Inftruments, are made in the 
fame manner, only they are rivetted underneath. 

The Figure D reprefents the Ball and Socket for fupporting the Inftrument, and is com- 
pofed of a Brafs Ball inclofed between two Shells of the fame Metal, which are made very 
round, with Balls of tempered Steel cut in manner of a File. Thefe Shells are locked more 
or lefs by means of a Screw, that fo they may prefs the Ball inclofed between them according 
to neceffity. One of thefe Shells is foldered to the Socket G, which is a turned Brafs Ferrel, 
in which the Foot of the Inftrument is put. Balls and Sockets are made of different Big- 
neffes, according to the Bigneffes of Inftruments, and are faftened to the Inftruments with 
Screws, in a Plate riveted to the Top of the Ball. 

Ccnflruflion of the Feet for fupporting of Inftruments. 

We have already mentioned the fimple Fe^t for fupporting Surveying-Crofies, which are 
to be forced into the Ground ; but thofe whofe Defcription we are now going to give, are 
not to be forced into the Ground, but are opened or fhut according as the Inequality of the 
Ground, the Inftrument is to be ufed upon, requires. 

The Foot E is a triangular Plate, in whofe Middle is a Piece b, which is to go into the 
Socket G. 

Underneath the aforefaid Plate are faftened three Ferrels, or Sockets, moveable by means of 
Joints, for receiving three round Staves of fuch a Length, that the Obferver's Eye, when the 
Inftrument is ufing, may commodioufly view Objects thro' the Telefcope, or Sights. The 
Extremities of thefe Staves are furnifhed with Ferrels and Iron Points, in order to keep the 
Inftrument firm when it is ufing. 

The Foot F confifts of four Staves, about two Foot long, whereof that in the Middle* 
called the Shank, hath it's Top rounded, that fo it may go into the Socket •, the reft of this 
Staff is cut in Figure of a Triangle, that fo the three Faces thereof may receive upon them 
three other Staves, faftened by means of three Screws (all of a piece) and fo many Nuts. 
Thefe three Staves are furnifhed with Ferrels and Iron Points, being flat within fide, and have 
three Faces without. 

When v/e have a mind to carry this Foot, we re-unite all the Staves together, fo that they 
make, as it were, but one, and by this means are fhorter by about the half, than when the 
Foot is ufing. 

We generally hang to the Middle of each of thefe Feet a Thread and Plummet, in order to 
know the Station- Point. 

U S E of the Theodolite. 

To take the Map of a Country by this Inftrument, chufe two high Places, for Example, Fig. i; 
the Obfervatory, and the Sah-Petre Houfe, from whence the Country nigh Paris, a Map of 
which is to be made, may be feen •, then mark round the Center of the upper Pafteboard the 
Name of the Place chofen for the firft Station, and having fixed it by means of the Point on 
the Limb of the Theodolite, put the Index upon it, which fufficiently fcrew down by means 
of the Nut and Screw. 

Now having placed the Theodolite upon it's Foot, planted at the Obfervatory, and given it 
a Situation nearly horizontal, fo that it may remain fteddy while the Index is moving, obferve 
thro' the Sights the Steeple of the Salt-Petre Houfe, and along the fiducial Line of the Index 
from the Center draw the Station-Line. 

Then turn the Index, and obferve fome remarkable Object thro' the Sights, as the Steeple 
of Vaugirard, towards which a Line muft be drawn upon the Pafteboard, from the Center, 
along the fiducial Line of the Index, and along this Line write the Name of the Place viewed 
thro' the Sights. 

Again, direct the Index towards fome other Object (as Mont-rouge) and draw a Line to- 
wards it from the Center, along the fiducial Line, and uppn this Line write the Nam* of the 

* Place 



1 08 The ConjlruSiion and Ufes Book IV. 

Place obferved. Proceed in the fame Manner with all the confiderabie Places that can be 
feen from the Obfervatory. 

Now having removed the Theodolite from it's firfl: Station, having well obferved it's Place, 
and tranfported it to fome other defigned Place, as to the Salt-Petre Houfe •, meafure the 
exact Diftance between the two Stations upon level Ground, the Number of Toifes of which 
mud be fet down upon your Pafteboard, which muft now be turned, or taken from under 
the Index, that fo at every different Station, the upper Face of the Pafteboard, upon which 
the Index is, may be clean : then fet down about the Center of this new Pafteboard, the 
Name of the Place of your fecond Station, and upon the Bafe Line the Number of Toifes 
meafured, that fo you may remember this Line is the fame as that on the precedent Pafte- 
board. The Theodolite being placed here, difpofe it fo, that placing the fiducial Line of 
the Index upon the Station Line, you may difcover thro' the Sights, the Obfervatory, which 
was your firft Station. 

The Inftrument remaining firm in this Situation, turn the Index, and fucceffively. view 
thro' the Sights the former Objects obferved from the Obfervatory, and draw Lines, as before, 
upon the Pafteboard, along the Index, from the Center towards the Places viewed, and upon 
each Line write the correfpondent Name of the Place. 

If all the Places you have a mind to fet down in your Map, cannot be feen from the two 
precedent Stations, you muft chufe a third Place from whence they may be obferved, and 
make as many new Stations, as are neceffary for perceiving each remarkable Object, from 
two Places fufficiently diftant from each other. 

Now to reprefent this Map upon a Sheet of Paper, firft draw a right Line at pleafure up- 
on it, for a common Bafe, which divide into the fame Number of equal Parts, as you have 
meafured Toifes upon the Ground. About one End of this Line, as a Center, defenbe cir- 
cular Arcs equal to thofe drawn upon the firft Pafteboard, and upon the other Extreme, Arcs 
equal to thofe drawn upon the fecond Pafteboard, and produce the Lines forming the Arcs 
'till they meet each other j then the Points of Concourfe, will be the Points of Pofition of the 
Places obferved. 

The aforefaid Places may be laid down upon the Paper eafier, by placing the Centers of 
the Pafteboards upon the Extremities of the common Bafe, and noting upon the Paper the 
Ends of the Lines drawn upon the Pafteboard, and then drawing Lines from the Stations 
thro' thofe Points 'till they interfect. 

By means of this Theodolite may be had in Degrees, or Parts, all the Angles that the 
Places viewed thro' the Sights or Telefcopes, make, with the Places whereat the Inftrument 
is placed. 

What we have faid, is fufficient to mew the Manner of ufing the Theodolite in taking the 
Pofition of Places, and making of Maps, becaufe the Operations are the fame for all different 
Places ; but for it's Ufes, with regard to Trigonometry, they are the fame as thofe of the 
Semi-circle and Quadrant, of which we are going to treat. 



CHAP. V. 

Of the ConfruSiton and Ufes of the Quadranty and Geometrick 

Quadrat. 

Fig. G. ^Tp H E Figure G, reprefents a Quadrant and Geometrick Square, with it's Index and 

J. Sights. 

It is commonly made of Brafs, or other folid Matter, 12 or 15 Inches Radius, and an an- 
fwerable Thicknefs. It's Circumference is firft divided into 90 Degrees, and every Degree 
into as many equal Parts as pofiible, without Confufion, and in fuch manner, that the Divi- 
fions and Subdivifions may be juft, and very diftindtly marked upon the Limb of the In- 
ftrument. 

To do which, there muft firft be 2 Arcs drawn nigh the Edge of the Quadrant, about 8 
or 9 Lines diftant from each other ; and after having divided them into Degrees, draw Dia- 
gonal Lines between them, from the firft Degree to the fecond, from the fecond to the third, 
and fo on to the laft. 

After which, if you have a mind to fubdivide every Degree into 10 Minutes, there muft 5 
Other concentrick Arcs be defcribed from the Center of the Inftrument, cutting all the afore- 
faid Diagonals •, but if every Degree is to be fubdivided into Minutes, there muft be 9 con- 
centrick Arcs defcribed between thofe two firft drawn. 

The Diftances between all thefe Arcs, muft not be all equal, becaufe the Extent of a De- 
gree taken in the Breadth of the Limb, forms a kind of Trapezium, broader towards the out- 
ward Arc, and narrower towards the inward one j whence a mean Arc dividing every De- 
gree 



Chap. 5 . of the Quadrant and Geometrkk Quadrat. x 09 

gree into 2 equal Parts, muft be nigher the inward Arc than the outward one, and the others 
in proportion. 

To make thefe Subdivifions exactly, the Diagonals muft be Curve Lines, as R D C, de- Fig H. 
fcnbed in making the Portion of a circular Arc pafs thro' the Center B, the beginning of the 
1 ft Degree marked D, upon the inward Arc, and the End C of the fame Degree, on the out- 
wark Arc : which is eafy to do by Ufe 18. Lib. 1. which fhews how to make a Circle pafs 
thro' 3 Points given, by which means the Point F, the Center of the Diagonal Curve, pafiing 
thro' the firft Degree, will be found. 

Afterwards one of thefe Diagonal Curves muft be divided into equal Parts, and from the 
Center of the Inftrument, there muft be drawn as many concentrick Arcs, as each Degree is 
to have equal Parts. 

The Reafon of this Operation is, that the Diagonal Curve being divided into equal Parts, 
if from the Center of the Inftrument there are drawn right Lines thro' all the Points of Divi- 
fion of that Arc, there will be had (per Prop. 27. Lib. 3. Eucl.) as many equal Angles in the 
Center, becaufc they will be all in the Circumference of the fame Circle, and ftand upon 
equal Arcs. 

But fince it is troublefome to find the Centers of 90 Arcs, each pafiing thro' 3 Points •, and 
fince it is manifeft, that all the Centers of thefe Arcs ought to be placed in the Circumfe- 
rence of a Circle whofe Center is the Point B ; there is no more to do but draw a Circle 
from the Center B, with the Diftance BF, and divide it's Circumference into 360 equal 
Parts - y upon every of which, fetting one Foot of your Compaffes, you may defcribe with the 
fame Extent F B, all the Arcs between the Circles AC, D E, and then the circular Arcs,- 
which are Diagonals, will likewife divide the Circumferences, upon the Limb of the Inftru- 
ment, into Degrees. Note, Becaufe the Figure is too little, it is divided but into every 5th 
Degree. 

Diagonal Curves may alfo be drawn without transferring the Foot of your Compaffes frorri 
one Degree to another, upon the aforefaid Arc, in fixing the Foot of your Compaffes in only 
one Point, as F, and letting the Inftrument be gradually turned about the Center of a large 
Circle, whofe Limb is already divided into Degrees, by means of a Rule ftrongly faftened 
upon the Inftrument, and reaching to the Divifions of the large Circle. 

Ingenious Workmen may fhorten their Work by adjufting a fine Steel Ruler, according to 
the Curvature of the firft Diagonal, which being drawn, by this means they may draw all 
the others. If Diagonal right Lines are to be drawn from one Degree to the other, the 
Lengths of the Radii of each of the Circumferences cutting the Diagonals, may be found by 
Trigonometry, an Example of which is as follows : 

Suppofe a Quadrant be 6 Inches Radius, which is the fmalleft accuftomed to be divided by 
Diagonals. Suppofe alfo you have a Scale of 1000 equal Parts, and that the Diftance from 
the inward Arc to the outward one, is 9 Lines, anfwering to 125 of fuch Parts, whereof the 
Radius is 1000 ; whence, by Calculation, I find that the right-lined Diagonal, drawn from 
one Degree to that which follows it, is 126 of the fame Parts ; and that the Radius of the in- 
ward Arc, whicn is 5 Inches, 3 Lines, contains 875 of them. 

The obtufe Angle made by the Radius and the Diagonal, is 172 Deg. 2 Min. and after- 
wards calculating the Lengths of the Radii of the Circumferences cutting the Diagonals, and 
dividing them into every 10 Minutes, I find that the Radius of 10 Min. is 894 of the fame 
equal Parts, inftead of 896 which it would have contained, if the Diftance between the in- 
ward and outward Arc had been divided into 6 equal Parts. The Radius of 20 Minutes 
ought to contain 913 of them, inftead of 917 •, the Radius of 30 Minutes ought to contain 
gi2 of them, inftead of 938 •, the Radius of 40 Minutes ought to contain 954 of them, in- 
ftead of 959. Laftly, the Radius of 50 Minutes ought to contain gyy, inftead of 980, which 
it muft, if the aforefaid Diftance be divided into 6 equal Parts. 

The greateft Error, which is about 5 Parts, anfwers to about '- of a Line, which may 
caufe an Error of 2 Minutes •, but this Error diminifhes in proportion as the Radius of the 
Quadrant augments in refpecl of the Diagonals, fo that the Error will be lefs by half, if the 
Radius of the Quadrant be one Foot, and the Diftance of the inward and outward Arcs is 
but 9 Lines. 

What we have faid as to the Divifions of the Quadrant, may likewife be applied to Theo- 
dolites, Circles, Semi-circles, or any other Portions of Circles to be divided into Minutes; 

As to the Geometrick Square, each Side of it is divided into 100 equal Parts, beginning 
at the Ends, that fo the Number 100 may end at the Angle of 45 Degrees. Thefe Divifions 
are diftinguilhed by little Lines from 5 to 5, and by Numbers from 10 to 10 ; all thofe Di- 
vifions being produced from a kind of Lattice, both ways containing 10000 fmall and equal 
Squares. 

This Quadrant is furnifhed with two immoveable Sights, faftened to one of it's Semi-dia* 
meters, and with a Thread and Plummet fixed to the Center, as likewife a moveable Index* 
with two other Sights, faftened to the Center, with a Headed-Rivet. The Sights are nearly 
like thofe belonging to the Theodolite. 

Inftead of immoveable Sights, there is fometimes fattened to one of the Radius's of the 
Quadrant a Telefcope, and then the ift Point of Divifion of the Circumference may be 

F f found 



no ^the ConflruSiion and Ufes Book IV. 

found in the manner as is explained hereafter in the Aftronomical Quadrant : for this Qua- 
drant is dcfigned only to take the Heights and Diftances of Places on Earth. 

Upon the under Surface of this Quadrant, is a Ball and Socket fattened with 3 Screws, by 
means of which it may be put into any Pofition fit for Ufe. 

This Inftrument may be put in Ufe in different Situations •, for firft, it may be fo difpofed 
that it's Plane may be at right Angles with the Horizon, for obferving Heights and Depths, 
which may yet be done two different ways, viz. in ufing the fixed Sights, and the Thread 
and Plummet, and then neither of it's Sides will be found parallel to the Horizon ; or elfe by 
keeping the Sights fattened to the Index moveable, and then one of the Semi-diameters of the 
Quadrant will always be parallel to the Horizon, and the other perpendicular: which may be 
done by means of a Plummet fufpended in the Center, and then the fixed Sights are ufelefs. 

Finally, the Quadrant may be placed fo as it's Plane may be parallel to the Horizon, for 
obferving horizontal Diftances with the Index and immoveable Sights, and then the Thread, 
with it's Plummet, is not in ufe. 

Ufes of the Quadrant : , with two fxed Sights and a Plummet. 

U S E I. To take the Height or Depth of any Objeff in Degrees. 

As fuppofe the Height of a Star or Tower is to be taken in Degrees j place the Quadrant 
vertically, then place your Eye under that fixed Sight next the Circumference of the Qua- 
drant, and direct it fo, that the vifual Rays patting through the Holes of the Sights, may 
tend to the Point of the Object propofed (as to the Sun, it is fufhcient that it's Rays pafs thro* 
the aforefaid Holes) : then the Arc of the Circumference contained between the Thread 
and it's Plummet, and the Semi-diameter on which the Sights are fattened, will fhow the 
Complement of the Star's Height above the Horizon, or it's Diftance from the Zenith : 
"Whence the Arc contained between the Thread, and the other Semi-diameter towards the 
Object, fhews it's Height above the Horizon. The fame Arc likewife determines the Quan- 
tity of the Angle made by the vifual Ray, and a horizontal Line, parallel to the Bafe of the 
Tower. 

But to obferve Depths, as thofe of Wells or Ditches, the Eye mutt be placed over that 
Sight, which is next the Center of the Quadrant. 

The whole Operation confifts in calculating Triangles by the Rule of Three, formed in the 
the Proportion of the Sines of Angles, to the Sines of their oppofite Sides, according to the 
Rules of right-lined Trigonometry, of which we are now going to give fome Examples. 

USE II. Let it be required to find the Height of the Tower AH, whofe Bafe is acceffible. 

F'g 2. Having planted the Foot of your Inftrument in the Point C, look at the Top of the 

Tower thro' the fixed Sights \ then the Thread of the Plummet freely playing, will fix itfelf 
upon the Number of Degrees, determining the Quantity of the Angle made at the Center of 
the Quadrant, by the vifual Ray, and the horizontal Line, parallel to the Bafe of the Tower, 
accounting the Degrees contained between the Thread and the Semi-diameter next to the 
Tower. 

Now fuppofe the Thread fixes upon 35 Deg. 35 Min. and having exactly meafured the 
level Diftance from the Foot of the Tower, with a Chain, to the Place of Observation, you 
will find it 47 Feet ; then there will be 3 things given, to wit, the Side B C, and the An- 
gies of the Triangle A B C: for fince Walls are always fuppofed to be built upright, the 
Angle B is a right Angle, or 90 Deg. and confequently the 2 acute Angles A and C, are to- 
gether equal to 90 Degrees, becaufe the three Angles of any right-lined Triangle, are equal 
to 180 Degrees, or 2 right Angles. 

Now the Angle obferved, is 35 Deg. 35 Min. whence the Angle A is 54 Deg. 25 Min. 
therefore you may form this Analogy, As the Sine of 54 Deg. 25 Min. is to 47 Feet, So is 
the Sine of 35 Deg. 35 Min. to a fourth Term, which will be found 33 z Feet-, to which 
adding 5 Feet, the Height of the Obferver's Eye, and the Height of the propofed Tower 
will be found 38 f Feet. 

USE III. Let it be required to find the Height of the inacceffble Tower D E. 
Fig. 3. In this Cafe two Obfervations muft be made, as follow : 

Place the Foot of your Quadrant in the Point F, and look thro' the two immoveable Sights to 
the Top of the Tower D ; then fee on what Degree the Thread of the Plummet fixes, which 
fuppofe on the 34th. This being done, remove the Inftrument, planting a Staff in it's Place, 
and fet it up in fome other Place level to the Place it was in before, as in the Point G, in 
the fame right Line, and look thro' the afore-mentioned Sights, at the Point D of the 
Tower. Note the Point in the Limb of the Quadrant that the Thread cuts, which fuppofe 
20 Degrees. Meafure likewife very exactly, the Diftance between the two Stations, which 
fuppofe 9 Toifes, or 54 Feet. 
^ This being done, all the Angles of the Triangle DFG will be known, as alfo the Side 
FG meafured; by which means it will be eafy to find the Side D F, and afterwards the 
Side E D, by making the following Analogies. 

The 



Chap. 5 . of the Quadrant and Geometrick Quadrat. 1 1 1 

The Angle EFD being found 34 Deg. it's Complement D F G to 180 Deg. will be 146 
Peg. and tlie Angle G having been found 20 Deg. it follows that the Angle FDG is 14 Deg. 
therefore fay, As the Sine of 14 Deg. is to 54 Feet, So is the Sine of 20 Deg. to a fourth Term, 
which will be 76 Feet, and about - T , for the Side DF: then fay, As Radius is to the Hypo- 
thenufe FD, So is the Sine of the Angle D F E, to the Side ED, which will be found 42 * 
Feet ; to which adding 5 Feet, the Height of the Center of the Instrument above the Ground, 
and there will be had 47 \ Feet, for the Height of the Tower propofed. 

Thefe Calculations are much better made with Logarithms, than by common Numbers, 
becaufe they may be done by only the help of Addition and Subftraction, as is more fully ex- 
plained in Books of Trigonometry. 

Thefe Propofitions, and others the like, may be alfo geometrically folved, by making Tri- 
angles fimilar to thofe formed upon the Ground. 

As to folve the prefent Queftion, make a Scale of ioToifes, that is, draw the right Line 
AB fo long, that the Divifion of it may be exact; and then divide it into 10 equal Parts, 
and fubdivide one of thefe Parts into 6 more, to have a Toife divided into Feet. 

Then draw the indeterminate Line EG, and make with a Line of Chords, or Protractor, 
an Angle at the Point G of 20 Degrees, and draw the indeterminate Line G D. Lay off 9 
Toifes, or 54 Feet, from G to F ; then make at the Point F an Angle of 34 Degrees, and 
draw the Line F D, cutting the Line G D in fome Point as D, from which let fall the Per- 
pendicular D E, which will reprefent the Height of the propofed Tower, and meafuring it 
with the Scale, you will find it to contain 47 Feet, 8 Inches. All the other Sides of thefe 
Triangles may likewife be meafured with the fame Scale. 

USE IV. To find the Breadth of a Ditch, or Well, ivhofe Depth may be meafured. 

Let it be propofed to meafure the Breadth of the Ditch CD, which may be approached. Fig, 4. 

Place the Quadrant upon the Brink in the Point A, fo that you may fee thro' the Sights 
the Bottom of the Ditch, at the Point D; then find the Angle made by the Thread upon 
the Limb, which fuppofe is 63 Degrees, and meafure the Depth A C, from the Center of the 
Quadrant, which fuppofe 25 Feet; then make a fimilar right-angled Triangle, one of whofe 
acute Angles is 63 Degrees (and confequently the other will be 27 Degrees), and the leaft 
Side is 25 Parts of fome Scale. Laftly, meafure with the fame Scale the Side CD, which 
will be about 49 ; therefore the Breadth of the Ditch is 49 Feet. 

USE of the Geometrick Quadrat. 

The Quadrant being vertically placed, and the Sights directed towards the Top of the Fig. G. 
Tower propofed to be meafured ; if the Thread of the Plummet cuts the Side of the Qua- 
drat, whereon is writ right Shadows, the Diftance from the Bafe of the Tower, to the Point 
of Station, is lefs than the Tower's Height : if the Thread falls upon the Diagonal of the 
Square, the Diftance is equal to the Height ; but if the Thread falls upon the Side of the 
Square, whereon b writ verfed Shadows, the Diftance of the Tower from you, is greater than 
it's Height. 

Now having meafured the Diftance from the Foot of the Tower, it's Height may be found 
by the Rule of Three, in having 3 Terms known, but their Difpofition is not always the 
fame ; for when the Thread cuts the Side, denoted right Shadow, the firft Term of the Rule 
of Three, ought to be that part of the Side cut by the Thread, the fecond Term will be the 
whole Side of the Square, and the third, the Diftance meafured. 

But when the Thread cuts the other Side of the Square, the firft Term of the Rule of 
Three, muft be the whole Side of the Square; the fecond Term, the Parts of that Side cut 
by the Thread ; and the third, the Diftance meafured. 

Suppofe, for Example, that looking to the Top of a Tower, the Thread of the Plummet 
cuts the Side of right Shadows in the Point 40, and that the Diftance meafured is 20 Toifes : 
I order the Rule of Three in the following manner; [40. 100. 20. 

Multiplying 20 by 100, and dividing the Product 2000 by 40, there will be found the 
fourth Term 50, which fhews the Height of the Tower to be 50 Toifes. 

But if the Thread of the Plummet falls on the other Side of the Square, as, for Example, 
upon the Point 60, and the Diftance meafured is 35 Toifes ; difpofe the three firft Terms of 
the Rule of Three thus, [100. 60. 35. 

Multiply 35 by 60, and the Product 2100 being divided by 100, will give 21 for the 
Height of the Tower. 

USE of the Quadrat without Calculation. 

All the aforefaid Operations, with many others, may be made without Calculation, as we 
fhall make manifeft by fome Examples. 

USE I. Let us fuppofe (as we have already done) that the Thread falls upon 40 on the F^g. G. 
Side of right Shadows, and that the Diftance meafured is 20 Toifes ; feek amongft the little 
Squares for that Perpendicular to the Side, which is 20 Parts from the Thread, and that 
Perpendicular will cut the Side of the Square next to the Center in the Point 50, which will 
be the Height of the propofed Tower in Toifes. 

USE 



H2 The CotiflruSiion and Ufes Book IV. 

USE II. But if the Thread cuts the Side of verfed Shadows in the Point 60, and the 
Diftance is 35 Toifes, count upon the Side of the Quadrant, from the Center, 35 Parts ; 
count alfo the Divifions of the Perpendicular from that Point 35 to the Thread, which will be 
a i, the Height of the propofed Tower in Toifes. 

Note, In all Cafes the Height of the Center of the Inftrument above the Ground, muft be 
added. 

USE III. To take an inacceffible Height with the Quadrat. 

To do which, there muft be made two Stations, whofe Diftance muft be meafured, and 
then there will be three Cafes. 

CASE I. When the right Shadow is cut in both Stations by the Thread. 

Let us fuppofe, for Example, that at the firft Obfervation the Side of right.Shadows is cut 
in the Point 30, and the Inftrument being removed 20 Toifes to a fecond Station, the Side of 
right Shadows is cut in the Point 70 -, then note the Pofition of the Thread in thefe two Sta- 
tions, by drawing a Line upon the Lattice with a Pencil, from the Center to the aforefaid 
Point 30, and another to the Point 70. Seek between thefe two Lines a Portion of a Parallel, 
which may have as many Parts as the Diftance meafured has Toifes, which in this Example 
muft be 20: then the faid Parallel being continued, will meet the Number 50, counting from 
the Center, whence the Height of the Tower obferved, will be 50 Toifes. You will likewife 
by the fame means find that the Diftance from the Bafe of the Tower, to the firft Station, is 
15 Toifes, becaufe there is 15 Parts contained upon the Parallel between the Number 50, and 
the Line drawn with the Pencil to the Number 30. 

Inftead of drawing Lines with a Pencil, two Threads faftened to the Center will do, one of 
which may be the Thread of the Plummet. 

CASE II. When the Side of verfed Shadows is cut at both Stations by the Thread. 

Suppofe, in the firft Station, that the Thread cuts the Side of verfed Shadows in the Point 
80, and that being removed 15 Toifes to another Station, the Thread falls upon the Number 
50 on the fame Side. Mark with a Pencil upon the Lattice, the two different Pofitions of the 
Thread in both Stations, and find between thefe two Lines, a Portion of a Parallel contain- 
ing as many Parts as the Diftance meafured contains Toifes, which, in this Example, is 15 
Toifes : to thefe 1 5 Parts add 25, which is the Continuation of the fame Parallel to the Side 
of the Square next to the Center, and the Sum makes 40 ; whence the Diftance of the Tower, 
from the fecond Station, is 40 Toifes : and to find it's Height, feek the Number 40 upon the 
Side of the Square next the Center, and count from that Number to the firft Line drawn on 
the Lattice with the Pencil, the Parts of the Parallel, which in this Example will be found 
20 •, therefore the Height of the Tower is 20 Toifes, by always adding the Height of the 
Quadrant. 

CASE III. If in one Station the Thread falls upon the Diagonal of the Square, and in 
the other it cuts the Side of right Shadows, you muft proceed in the fame manner as when the 
Thread at both Stations falls upon the Side of right Shadows. 

But when the Thread falls along the Diagonal in one Station, and upon the Side of verfed 
Shadows in the other, you muft proceed in the fame manner, as when the Thread cuts, at 
both Stations) the Side of verfed Shadows. 

The Reafon of all this is, becaufe there is always made upon the Lattice a little Triangle 
fimilar to a great one, made upon the Ground, altho' diverfiy pofited. The Line made by 
the Thread and Plummet always reprefents the Vifual Ray ; the two other Sides of the little 
Triangle, which make a right Angle, reprefent the Height of the Tower and it's Diftance ; 
and when the Thread cuts the Side of right Shadows, the Height is reprefented by the Di- 
vifions of the Sides of the Lattice, which is perpendicular to the Side of the Quadrat ; but 
when the Thread cuts the Side of verfed Shadows, the Diftance is reprefented by the Divi- 
fions of the Side diftant from the Center, and the Height by the Perpendicular anfwering to 
the Number of Divifions of the fame Side. 

USE IV. To find the Depth of a Ditch or Well. 

The Breadth of the Ditch (or Well) muft firft be meafured, and afterwards you muft place 
the Quadrant upon the Brink, and look thro' the two Sights, 'till you fee the oppofite Point, 
where the Surface of the Water touches the Side of the Ditch •, then the Thread will cut the 
Parallel, anfwering to the Feet or Toifes of the Ditch's Breadth •, and that Perpendicular, at 
which the Parallel ends, will determine the Depth, from which muft be.lubftracted the 
Height of the Inftrument above the Brink of the Ditch.

USE of the Quadrant in taking of Heights and Diflances, by means of an Index 

and it's Sights. 

Place the Quadrat fo that it's Plane may be at right Angles with the Plane of the Horizon, 
and one of it's Sides parallel thereto, which will be done when the Plummet, freely -hanging, 
falls along the other Side of the Quadrant. 

In 



Chap. 5* of the Quadrant and Geometrkk Quadrat. 113 

In this Situation the two fixed Sights are of no Ufe, unlefs they are ufed to obferve the 
Diftance between two Stars, and then the Quadrant mud be inclined, by directing the im- 
moveable Sights towards one Star, and the moveable ones towards the other-, and the Num- 
ber of Degrees, comprehended between them, will be the Diftance of the Stars in Degrees. 

If it is ufed to obferve an Height, the Center of the Inftrument mud be above the Eye; 
but if a Depth is to be obferved, the Eye muft be above the Center of the Inftrument. 

U S E I. To take an Height , as that of a Tower •, wbofe Bafe is acceffible. 

Having placed the Quadrant, as already fhewn, turn the Index.; fo that you may fee the 
Top of the Tower thro' the two Sights •, and the Arc of the Limb of the Quadrant, between 
that Side of it parallel to the Horizon, and the Index, will be the Height of the Tower in 
Decrees. If afterwards the Diftance from the Foot of the Tower, to the Place where the In- 
ftrument ftands, be exactly meafured, there will be three things given in the Triangle to be 
meafured •, namely, the Bafe, and the two Angles made at it's Ends, one of which will be 
always a right Angle, becaufe the Tower is fuppofed to be built upright, and the other the 
An^le before obferved ; whence the other Sides of the Triangle may be found by the Rules 
of rioht-lined Trigonometry, or elfe without Calculation, by drawing a little Triangle fimilar 
to the great one, whofe Bafe is the Ground, and Perpendicular the Height of the Tower ; or 
otnerwile by the Geometrick Square, in obferving, that in that Pofition of the Quadrant, 
the Side of right Shadows ought always to be parallel to the Horizon, and the Side of verfed 
Shadows perpendicular thereto. 

USE II. To find the Height of a Tower ', whether acccffible or inacceffible^ by means of 

the Quadrat. 

In the aforementioned Pofition of the Quadrant, there are always formed, in the Quadrat, 
little fimilar Triangles, whofe homologous Sides are parallel and fimilarly pofited to thofe of 
the great ones formed upon the Ground -, by which means the Operations are rendered more 
fimple and eafy than in the other Situation of the Quadrant •, as we come now to explain, by 
making three different Suppofitions, according to the different Cafes that may happen. 

CASE I. Let us fuppofe, for Example, that having obferved the Height of a Tower, 
whofe tiafe is accefilble, thro' the Sights of the Index, the Index cuts the Side of right Sha- 
dows in the Point 40, and the Diftance to the Bafe of the Tower is 20 Toifes ; feek among 
the Parallels to the Horizon, from that which paries thro' the Center to the Index, the Paral- 
lel of 20 (becaufe 20 Toifes is the Diftance fuppofed), and you will find that it terminates at 
the Number 50, on the perpendicular Side of the Square, reckoning from the Center ; whence 
the Height of the Tower is 50 Toifes above the Center of the Inftrument. 

CASE If. Suppofe, in another Obfervation, that the Index cuts the Side of verfed Sha- 
dows in the Point 60, and the Diftance meafured is 35 Toifes ; count from the Center of the 
Quadrant upon the Side parallel to the Horizon 35, and from this Point, reckoning the Parts 
of the Perpendicular, to the Interferon of the Index, and you will find 21 ; whence the 
Height of the Tower is 2 1 Toifes. 

CASE III. Lajlly, Suppofe the Bafe of the Tower to be inacceflible, and that there muft 
be made two Stations (as we have faid before)-, the Height of it may be found without any 
Diftinction of right or verfed Shadows : for having meafured the Diftance between the two 
Stations, and drawn two Lines in the Quadrat, fhewing the Situation of the Index in thofe 
two Stations, find between thofe two Lines a Portion of a Parallel to the Horizon, which 
fhall have as many Parts, as the Diftance meafured contains Toifes: then if you continue that 
to the perpendicular Side of the Square diftant from the Center, you will there find a Number 
expreffing tne Height of the Tower, and the Continuation of that Parallel to this Number, 
will fhew the Diftance to the Bafe of the Tower. 

Note, In this Situation of the Quadrant, horizontal Diftances are always reprefented in the 
Quadrat by Lines parallel to the Horizon, and Heights are always reprefented by Lines per- 
pendicular to the Horizon, which renders (as we have already faid) Operations more eafy. 

It does not happen fo in that other vertical Pofition of the Quadrant, when the fixed Sights 
are ufed -, for if in obferving the Height of an inacceflible Tower, the Thread of the Plummet 
in one Station falls upon the Side of right Shadows, and in the other Station, on the Side of 
verfed Shadows, the Diftance between the two Lines drawn with a Pencil on the Lattice, 
croffes the Squares of the Lattice by their Diagonals, which will not have common Meafures 
with the Sides ; whence it cannot be ufed to find the Height of the propofed Tower. 

USE of the Quadrant in meafuring of Horizontal Diftances. 

Altho' a Quadrant is not fo proper to meafure horizontal Diftances, as a Semi-circle or 
whole Circle, becaufe by it obtufe Angles cannot well be taken, yet we fhall here give fome 
Ufes of it by means of the Quadrat. Place the Quadrant upon it's Foot nighly parallel to the 
Horizon -, for there is no Neceflity of it's Plane being perfectly level, becaufe fometimes it 
muft be inclined to perceive Objects thro' the Sights. 

Then put the Foot of the Inftrument in the Line to be meafured, and make two Obferva- 
tions in the following manner, not ufing the Plummet, but the four Sights. 

G g Suppofe 



1 1 4 The ConftruBion and Ufes B o o k I V. 

Fig. 5. Suppofe, for Example, the perpendicular Diftance A B is to be meafured ; plant feveral 

Staffs in the Line ACD, and the Quadrant in the Point A, in fuch manner that the two 
fixed Sights may be in the Line A C, and the Point B may be feen thro' the two moveable 
Sights, placed at right Angles with the Line A C : then remove the Quadrant, planting a 
Staff in it's place, and meafure from A towards C, any Length ; as, for Example, 18 Toifes: 
at the End of which, having placed the Inftrument, fo that the two fixed Sights may be in 
the Line A C, move the Index 'till you fee the Point B thro' it's Sights, and you will have up- 
on the Lattice a little Triangle, fimilar to the great one made upon the Ground •, therefore 
feek amongft the Parallels cue by the Index, that which contains as many Parts as the Diftance 
meafured does Toifes; that is, in this Example, iS, which will terminate on the Side of the 
Quadrant, at a Number containing as many Parts as there are Toifes in the Line A B pro- 
pofed to be meafured. 

The Diftance A B may yet otherwife be found, whether perpendicular or not, without 
making a Station at right Angles with the Point A. 

Suppofe, for Example, that the firft Station is made in the Point C, and the fecond in the 
Point D •, draw upon the Lattice two right Lines with a Pencil, or otherwife, (hewing the 
two different Pofitions of the Index in both the Stations ; and having meafured the Diftance 
of the Points C and D, which fuppofe 20 Toifes, feek between the two Lines drawn with a 
Pencil, a Portion of a Parallel which is 20 Parts, and that will correfpond, upon the Semi- 
diameter of the Geometrick Quadrat, to a Number, which, reckoned from the Center, will 
contain as many Parts as the right Line A B does Toifes. 

You will likewife find the Lengths of the Diftances C B and DB, by the Divifions of the 
Index •, for there is upon the Lattice a little oblique-angled Triangle fimilar to the great one 
C D B upon the Ground. 

CHAP. VI. 

Of the ConJlruBion and Ufes of the Semi-Circle, 

Fig. I. Sc K. r I ^ H E S E Inftruments which are alfo called Graphometers, are made of beaten or caft 
j^ Brafs, from 7 Inches Diameter to 15 ; the Divifions of them are made in the fame 
manner as thofe of the Theodolite and Quadrant, before explained. The fimpleft of thefe 
Inftruments, is that of Fig. K ; at the Ends of it's Diameter, and in little fquare Holes made 
upon the fiducial Line, there is adjufted two fixed Sights, fattened with Nuts underneath, and 
upon it's Center there is a moveable Index furnifhed with two other Sights, made in the fame 
manner as thofe before-mentioned for the Theodolite, and which is fattened with a Screw. 
There is a Compafs placed in the Middle of it's Surface, for finding the North Sides of Planes. 
There is alfo fixed underneath to it's Center, a Ball and Socket, like that mentioned in the 
Conftruclion of the Theodolite, and for the fame Ufe. 

Note, Thefe Inftruments ought to be well ftraightned with hammering; then they muft 
be fafhioned with a rough File, and afterwards fmoothed With aBaftard-File, and a fine one. 
"When they are filed enough, you muft fee whether they are not bent in filing ; if they are, 
they ought to be well ftraightned upon a Stone, or very plain Piece of Marble ; then they 
muft be rubbed over with Pumice-Stone and Water, to take away the Tracts of the File. 
To polifh Semi-Circles well, as alfo any other Inftruments, you muft ufe German-Slate Stone, 
and very fine Charcoal, fo that it does not fcratch the Work : afterwards, to brighten them, 
you muft lay a little Tripoli, tempered in Oil, upon a Piece of Shamoy, and rub it over them. 

The Semi-Circle I, carries Telefcopes for feeing Objects at a good Diftance, and has the 
Degrees of it's Limb divided into Minutes, by right-lined or curved Diagonals, as in the 
Quadrant before-mentioned. 

There is one Telefcope placed underneath along the Diameter of the Semi-Circle, whofe 
Ends are B B ; and another Telefcope adjufted to the Index of the Semi-Circle. When the 
fiducial Line cuts the Middle of the Index, the Telefcope faftened to it muft be a little fhorter 
than the Index, to the End that the Degrees cut by the fiducial Line may be feen ; but the 
beft way is for the Telefcopes to be of equal Length, and then the fiducial Line muft be drawn 
from the End C, paffing thro' the Center of the Semi-Circle, and terminating in the oppofite 
End D. The two Ends of the Index are cut fo as to agree with the Degrees upon the Limb, 
as may be feen at the places C F, G D, in fuch manner that the Line C F E G D, may be 
the fiducial Line of the Semi-Circle. 

Note, The Degrees on this Semi-Circle do not begin and end at the Diameter, as'in others* 
but at the Lines C F, G D, when the Telefcopes are fo placed over each other, that the vi- 
fual Rays agree. To make which, the little Frame carrying the crofs flairs, muft be moved 
backwards or forwards by means^ of Screws. The Breadth from the Middle of the Tele- 
fcope, 



Chap. 6* of the Semi-Circle. j j ? 

fcope, to the Points F, G, is commonly about 5 Degrees •, and this is the Reafon why the 
Divifions begin further from the Diameter than they end, as may be feen per Fioure. 

Thcfe Tclefcopes have two or four Glaffes, and have a very fine Hair ltraincd in the Focus 
of the Object-Glafs, ferving for a Sight. 

Tclefcopes with four Glaffes fhew Objects in their true Situation, but thofe with two Glaffes 
invert them •, fo that that which is on the right Hand appears on the left, and that which is 
above appears below : but this does not at all hinder the Truth of Operations, becaufe they 
always give the Point of Direction. 

Thefe Telefcopes are made with Brafs Tubes foldered, and turned in a Cylindrick Form 4 
as may be feen by the Figure L, which reprefents a Telefcope taken to pieces ; the Eye- 
Glafs, being that to which the Eye is applied to look at Objects, is at the End 1. It is put 
in another little Tube apart (likewife marked 1) which is drawn out, or flid into the Te- 
lefcope, according to different Sights. This little Tube alfo fometimes carries the Hair in 
the Focus of "the Glafs, ferving as a Sight •, but it is better for the Hair to be faftened to a 
little Piece of Brafs ,feen apart) on which there is very exactly drawn a fquare Tract 2, upon 
which the Hairs are placed. The faid Piece is placed in a Groove made in a little Brafs 
Frame, foldered to the Tube of the Telefcope at the Place 2 ; the fmall Screw 5 is to move 
forwards or backwards, the little Piece carrying the Hairs •, the Object-Glafs is placed at the 
other End of the Telefcope, next to the Object to be feen. It is alfo placed in the little 
Tube 3, which being put into the Tube of the Telefcope, muft be binded pretty much by 
it, that it may not eafily change it.'s Place when the Telefcope is adjufted. The Glaffes are 
convex, which renders their Middle thicker than their Edges ; but the Eye-Glafs muft have 
more Convexity than the Object-Glafs, to the end that Objects may appear greater than by 
the naked Eye. 

The Focus of a Convex Glafs is that Place where the Rays, coming from a luminous or 
coloured Object, unite, after having paffed thro' the Glafs ; whence the Picture of Objects, 
oppofite to the Glafs, are there very diftinctly reprefented. For example, the Point R, at 
the End of the Cone of the Figure FT, is the Focus of the Glafs S, becaufe it is the Point 
where the Rays, entering at the other End N of the Tube, unite, after having paffed thro' 
the Glafs S. 

The Telefcopes moft in Ufe (for Semi-Circles) are thofe with two Glaffes, which are Co 
placed, that their Foci are common, and unite in the fame Point in the Tube of the Tele- 
fcope, in which Point the Hairs are placed ; if the focal Length of the Object-Glafs is (even 
or eight times greater than that of the Eye-Glafs, the Object will appear feven or eight times 
greater than when the Foci of the two Glaffes are equal. 

The Focus of the Eye-Glafs being common with that of the Object-Glafs, the coloured 
Rays, which falling upon the Surface of the Object-Glafs, and uniting in the Focus of the 
Glafs, afterwards continue their way diverging to the Eye-Glafs, and pafs thro' it; fo that 
placing the Eye behind it, Objects may be perceived, whofe Pictures are reprefented in the 
Focus : for it is the Object that fends forth it's Species to the Eye, as may be yet very manifeft* 
]y proved by the loliowing Experiment. 

Darken a Room, by fhutting the Window-Shutters, and make a round Hole in fome 
Shutter, whofe Window is expofed to a Place on which the Sun fhines : in which Hole place 
a Convex Glafs, and alfo. a white Piece of Paper or Sheet in the Room, oppofite to the Hole, 
and at the Glafs's focal Diftance from it ; then a very diftinct Reprefentation of all outward 
Objects, oppofite to the Hole in the Shutter, will be painted upon the Paper in the Room in 
an inverted Situation ; and this Picture is made by Rays of Light coming from the Objects 
without. The focal Diftance of the Glafs may be found, by moving the Paper backwards 
and lorwards, 'till the Reprefentation of the Objects are diftinctly perceived. 

There is a Ball and Socket belonging to this Semi-Circle, which, being well made, in the 
aforefaid manner, is the moft perfect that can be made. 

The Inftrument M is a Protractor about 8 or 10 Inches Diameter, with it's moveable Index j 
we make them fometimes as large as Graphometers, and ufe them both in taking Angles in 
the Field to a Minute, and alfo plotting them upon Paper. 

The Index of this Protractor turns about a circular Cavity, in the Middle of which is a 
little Point, fhewing the Center of the Protractor. The Divifions of the Limb of this Pro- 
tractor are made in the fame manner as thofe on the Limb of the Semi-Circle, and by the Me- 
thod before explained. 

USEI. To take the Plot of a propofed Field, asABCDE; plant a Staff very up- F i g . 6. 
right, at each Angle of the Field, and meafure exactly, with a Toife, one of it's Sides, as 
A B, which fuppofe 50 Toifcs, 2 Feet ; then make a Memorial, on which draw a Figure 
fomething like the Field propofed : This being done, place the Semi-Circle, with it's Foot, 
in the Place of the Staff A •, fo that looking thro' the fixed Sights of the Diameter, you may 
fee the Staff B. Afterwards, the Semi-Circle remaining fixed in this Pofition, turn the Index, 
fo that you may fee thro' the Sights the Staff C. Note the Angle made by the fiducial Line 
with the Side A B, and writedown, in your Memorial, the Quantity of the Angle B A C j 
afterwards turn the Index fo, that you may fee the Staff D thro' the Sights, and write down 

in 



j 1 6 ^The Conjiruciion and Ufes Book IV. 

in your Memorial the Quantity of the Angle B AD : Again, turn the Index fo that you may 
fee thro' the Sights the Staff E, and fet down the Quantity of the Angle BAE; but every 
time you look thro' the Sights, Care muff be taken that the Staff B is in a right Line with 
the Sights of the Diameter. 

This being done, remove the Semi-Circle with it's Foot, and having replanted the Staffs, 
place the Semi-Circle, with it's Foot, in the Place of the Staff B, in fuch manner, that by 
looking thro' the fixed Sights of the Diameter* you may fee the Staff A -, and the Semi-circle 
remaining fixed in this Situation, turn, as you have already done, the Index fo that you may 
fucceffively fee the Staffs C, D, E, and write down in the Memorial the Quantities of the 
Angles ABC, A B D, ABE. 

Finally t Plot the Field exactly with a Semi-Circle or Protra&amp;or, by laying down all the 
Angles, whofe Quantities are marked at the Ends of the Line A B, from whence may be 
drawn as many right Lines, and from their Interfedlions other Lines, which will form the 
Plot of the Field propofed. The Lengths of all thofe Sides which have not been meafured, 
may be found by a Scale of equal Parts, of which the Line A B is 50 4» and the Area of the 
Field may be found by finding the Area of all the Triangles it may be reduced into. 

Note, It is.proper to meafure one of the longeft Sides of the Field, for ufing it as a com- 
mon Bafe, and making at both it's Ends all the Obfervations neceiTary for there forming the 
Angles of the Triangles required to be made ; for if one of the fliorteft Lines be taken for a 
common Bafe to all the Triangles, the Angles formed by the Interfe&amp;ions of the vifual Rays 
in looking at the Staffs, will be too acute, and fo their Interjections very uncertain. 

The Meridian Line of Plans may be known by help of the Compafs, whofe Meridian is 
generally parallel to the Diameter of the Semi-Circle : for fince the common Bafe of all the 
Triangles obferved, is parallel to the faid Diameter, you need but note the Angle which it 
makes with the Needle of the Compafs, and this may be eafily done by directing the fiducial 
Line parallel to the Needle ; after which you may draw upon the Plot a little Card in it's 
true Pofition. 

USE II. 'To find the Diftance from the Steeple A, to the Tower C, they being fuppofed 

inaccejjible. 

Pig, - Having chofen 2 Stations, from which the Steeple and Tower may be feen, and meafured 

their Diftance ferving as a Bafe, place the Semi-Circle at one of them, as D, and the Staff in 
the other, as in the Point E, and turn it fo, that thro' the fixed Sights of it's Diameter, or 
thro' the Telefcope, you may efpy the Staff E : then move the Index fo, that thro' it's Sights 
you may fee the Steeple A •, and the Degrees of the Semi-Circle between the Diameter and the 
Index, will give the Quantity of the Angle B D E, being in this Example 3 Deg. which note 
in your Memorial. Again •, turn the Index 'till you fee the Tower C thro' the Sights or 
Telefcope, always keeping the Diameter in the Line D E ; then the Degrees between the 
Diameter and Index, will fhew the Quantity of the Angle CDE, 123 Deg. which hkewife 
note in the Memorial. Now having removed the Semi-Circle from the Station D, and 
placed a Staff in it's Place, meafure the Diftance from the Staff D to the Staff E, which 
fuppofe 32 Toifes, writing it in the Memorial : then put the Semi-Circle in the Place of the 
Staff E, fo that the fixed Sights of the Diameter, or Telefcope, may be in the Line ED; 
and turn the Index, that the Tower C may be feen thro' it's Sights, then the Degrees con- 
tained between the Diameter, and the Index, will give the Angle CE D, which in this Ex- 
ample is 26 Degrees. Finally, Turn the Index 'till you fee the Steeple A thro' the Sights, 
and the Angle A ED will be 125 Degrees, which fet down in the Memorial, and by help of 
a Scale and Protractor, the Diftance A C may be known. 

To folve the fame Problem trigonometrically ; firft, We have found by Obfervation in the 
Triangle DAE, that the Angle A DE is 32 Degrees, and the Angle D E A 125 Degrees, 
whence the Angle DAE is 23 Degrees (becaufe the three Angles of any right-lined Trian- 
gle, are equal to 2 right Angles), and to find the Side A E, make this Analogy : As the Sine 
of 23 Degrees is to 32 Toifes, So is the Sine of 32 Degrees to the Line AE, about 43 Toifes. 
Likewife you will find by Obfervation in the Triangle CDE, that the Angle C D E is 26 
Degrees, and the Angle E D C 123 Degrees, whence the Angle D C E is 31 Degrees ; and 
to find the Side C E, make this fecond Analogy : As the Sine of 31 Degrees is to 32 Toifes, 
So is the Sine of 123 Degrees, or it's Complement $j, which is the fame, to C E 52 Toifes. 
Now to find the Diftance C A, examine the Triangle C A E, whofe two Sides C E, A E, 
with the included Angle A E C of 99 Degrees, are known, and confequently the Sum of the 
two unknown Angles are equal to 81 Degrees ; and to find either of them, make again this 
Analogy : As the Sum of the two known Sides 95 Toifes, is to their Difference 9, So is the 
Tangent of 40 Deg. 30 Min. half the Sum of the oppofite Angles, to the Tangent of half 
their Diftance, which anfwers to 4 Deg. 37 Min. and being added to 40 Deg. 30 Min. 
will give the greateft of the unknown Angles C AE, 45 Deg. 7 Min. and confequently the 
other Angle A CE, will be -$$ Deg. 53 Min. Laftly, to find the Length C A, fay, As the 
Sine of 35 Deg. $■$ Min. is to 43 Toifes, So is the Sine of ^ Deg. to the Diftance A C, 72 
Toifes, 2 Feet.

USE III. To find the Height of the Tower AB, whofe Bafe cannot be approached be- 
caufe of a Rivulet parting by it's Foot ; chufe two Stations fomewhere upon level Ground, as 
in C and D, and place the Semi-Circle vertically in the Point D, fo that it's Diameter may Fig. 8. 
be parallel to the Horizon, which you may do by means of a Thread and Plummet, hung 
on the Top of a Perpendicular drawn on the backfide of the Semi-Circle : then turn the 
Index, in order to fee the Top of the Tower B thro' the Sights, and take the Quantity of 
the Angle B D A, which fuppofe 42 Degrees, noting it down in your Memorial. Now 
having removed the Semi-Circle, and placed it at the other Station C, meafure the Diftance 
DC, which fuppofe 12 Toifes •, and after having adjufted the Semi-Circle, fo that it's Dia- 
meter may be parallel to the Horizon, turn the Index 'till you fee the Top of the Tower B, 
and fet down the Quantity of the Angle PCD, which fuppofe 22 Degrees, in the Memo- 
rial ; then make a fimilar Figure by means of a Scale and Protractor, and the Height of the 
Tower A B will be found ; which may likewife be found by Calculation in the following man- 
ner : The Angle B D A of 42 Degrees, gives the Angle B D C of 1 38 Degrees ; and fince 
the Angle C of 22 Degrees has been meafured, the third Angle of the Triangle CBD will be 
20 Degrees. Now fay, As the Sine of 20 Degrees is to 12 Toifes, So is the Sine of 22 De- 
crees, to the Line BD, about 13 Toifes; but B D is the Hypothenufe of the right-angled 
Triangle B D A, all the Angies of which are known : therefore fay by a fecond Rule of Three, 
As Radius is to about 13 Toifes, So is the Sine of 42 Degrees to the Height AB, 8 Toifes, 
and one Foot. 

USE IV. To take the Map of a Country. 

Firft, chufe 2 high Places, from whence a great Part of the Country may be feen, which Fig. 9* 
let be fo remote from each other, as that their Diftance may ferve as a common Bafe to fe- 
veral Triangles that muff be obferved for making of the Map •, then meafure with a Chain 
the Diftance of thefe two Places. Thefe two Places being fuppofed A and B, dift ant from 
each other 200 Toifes, place the Plane of the Semi-Circle horizontally, with it's Foot in the 
Point A, in fuch manner, that you may difcover the Point B thro' the fixed Sights or Tele- 
fcope: the Inftrument remaining fixed in this Situation, turn the Index, and fuccetTively difco- 
ver Towers, Steeples, Mills, Trees, and other remarkable Things defired to be placed in the 
Map: examine the Angles which every of them make with the common Bafe, and fet them 
down together with their proper Names in the Memorial : As, for Example, the Angle B A I 
14 Degrees, B A G 47, B A H 53, B A F 68, B A E 83, B A D 107 ; and, laftly, the An- 
gle B A C 130 Degrees: which being done, and the Diftance of the two Stations AB fet 
down, place the Semi-Circle in the Point B, for a fecond Station. 

The Inftrument being fo placed that it's Diameter may be in the Line B A, turn the Index, 
and obferve the Angles made by the Objects before feen from the Point A ; as for Example, 
the Angle A B C 20 Degrees, ABF 37, A B D 44, A BE 56, ABG 83, ABH 96, and 
the Angle A B I 133 Degrees, which note down in the Memorial. 

If any Object viewed from the Point A, cannot be feen from the Point B, the Bafe muft 
be changed, and another Point fought, from whence it may be difcovered ; for it is abfo- 
lutely neceffary for the fame Object to be feen at both Stations, becaufe it's Pofition cannot 
be had but by the Interferon of two Lines drawn from the Ends of the Bafe, with which 
they form a Triangle. 

Note., The Bafe muft be pretty long, in proportion to the Triangles for which it ferves, 
and moreover very ftraight and level. 

To make the Map, reduce all thofe Triangles obferved, to their juft Proportion, by means 
of a Scale and Protractor, in the manner as we have already given Directions, in the Ufe of 
the Theodolite.

CHAP. VII. 

Of the ConftriiElion and Ufe of the Compafs. 

TH I S Inftrument is made of Brafs, Ivory, Wood, or any other folid Matter, from 2 to Fig. O. 
6 Inches in Diameter, being in figure of a Parallelopipedon, in the Middle of which is 
a round Box, at the Bottom of which is defcribed a Card (of which more in the Conftruction 
of the Sea-Compafs) whofe Circumference is divided into 360 Degrees. In the Center of this 
Card is fixed a well -pointed Brafs or Steel Pivot, whofe Ufe is to carry the touched Needle 
placed upon it, in Equilibria, fo that it may freely turn. This Box is covered with a round 
Glafs, for hindring left the Air fhould any wife agitate the Needle. 

One of the Ends ot the Needle always turns towards the North Part of the World, but 
not exactly, it declining therefrom, and the other towards the South. 

According to Obftrvations made in Oflober, in the Year i?i^, in the Royal Obfervatory, 
'the Needle declined 2 Deg. 5 Min. Weftwardly. 

H h Needles 



1 1 8 The ConftruEiion and Ufes Book IV. 

Needles are made of Pieces of Steel, the Length of the Diameter of the Box, having little 
Brafs Caps foldered to their Middle, hollowed into a conical Figure fo, that the Needle being 
put upon the Pivot, may move very freely upon it, and not Tall off* they are nicely filed 
into different Figures, thofe which are large being like a Dart* and fmall ones have Rings to- 
wards one End, for knowing that End which refpects the North, as may be feen in the little 
Figures nigh the Compafs. 

To touch a Needle well, having firft got a good Stone, begin your Touch near the Mid- 
dle of the Needle, and prefling it pretty hard hard upon the Pole of the Stone, draw it flowly 
along to the End of the Needle, and lifting your Hand a good Diftance from the Stone, while 
you put the Needle forward again, begin a fecond Touch in the fame manner, and after 
that a third, which is enough, only take Care not to rub the Needle to and fro on the 
Stone, whereby the backward Rubs take away what Virtue the forward ones gave ; but lift 
it out of the Sphere of the Stone's Virtue, when you carry it forward again to begin a new 
Touch. 

This admirable Property, by help of which great Sea- Voyages were firft undertaken, and 
vafl Nations both in the Eaft and Weft difcovered, was not known in Europe 'till about the 
Year 1260. 

A Man by means of this Inftrument, and a Map, may likewife go to any propofed Place, 
at Land, without enquiring of any body the way •, for he need but fet the Center of the 
Compafs, upon the Place of Departure, on the Map, and afterwards caufe the Needle to 
agree with the Meridian of this Place upon the Map : then if he notes the Angle that the 
Line leading to the Place makes with the Meridian, he need but in travelling keep that An- 
gle with the Meridian, and that will direct him to the Place dtfired. 

This Inftrument is alfo very ufeful to People working in Quarries, and Mines under 
Ground ; for having noted upon the Ground the Point diredly over that you have a mind to 
go to, you muft place the Compafs at the Entrance into the Quarry or Mine, and obferve 
the Angle made by the Needle with the Line of Direction : then when you are under Ground, 
you muft make a Trench, making an Angle with the Needle equal to the aforefaid Angle ; 
by means of which you may come to the propofed Place under Ground. There are feveral 
other Ufes of this Inftrument, the principal of which we are now going to fpeak. 

U S E I. To take the Declination of a Wall with the Compafs. 

You muft remember that there are 4 Points, called Cardinal ones, viz. North, South, 
Eaft, and Weft, dividing the Horizon into 4 equal Parts, and when one of thefe Points are 
found, all the others may likewife : for if you have North before you, South will be behind, 
Eaft on the right-hand, and Weft on the left. 

A Wall built upon a Line tending from North to South, will be in the Plane of the Meri- 
dian ; fo that one Side thereof will face the Eaft, and the other the Weft. 

Another Wall, at right Angles with the former, that is, one built upon the Line of Eaft 
and Weft, will be parallel to the Prime Vertical, and will not decline at all, and one of it's 
Sides will, be directly South, and the other North. 
Fig. io. But if a Wall is fuppofed to be built upon the Line DE, it is faid to decline as many De- 

grees as is contained in the Arc F ; therefore if, for Example, that Arc be 40 Degrees, the 
Side of the Wall facing towards the South, declines from the South towards the Eaft 40 
Degrees, and the oppofite Side of the Wall will decline from the North towards the Weft 
40 Degrees : fo that the Declination of a Wall, is no more than the Angle made by the Wall 
and the Prime Vertical. Another Wall parallel to the Line G H, will decline as many De- 
grees as is contained in the Arc C; therefore if that Arc be 30 Degrees, the Side of the Wall 
refpecting the South, will decline 30 Degrees from the South towards the Weft, and the other 
Side will decline 30 Degrees from the North to the Eaft. 

In all Operations made with a Compafs, you muft take care of bringing it nigh Iron or 
Steel, and that there be none concealed j for Iron or Steel entirely changes the Direction of 
the Needle. 

I fuppofe here that the Pivot, upon which the Cap of the Needle is put, is in the Center 
of a Circle divided into 360 Degrees, or four Nineties, whofe firft Degree begins from the 
Meridian Line, and alfo that the Compafs be fquare, as that which is reprefented in the 
Figure. 

Apply the Side of the Compafs where the North is marked, to the Side of the Wall j then 
the Number of Degrees over which the Needle fixes, will be the Wail's Declination, and on 
that Side. If, for Example, the North Point of the Needle tends towards the Wall, it is a 
fign that that Side of the Wall may be fhone on by the Sun at Noon •, and if the Needle fixes 
over 30 Degrees, counting from the North towards the Eaft, the Declination is fo many 
Degrees from South towards the Eaft. If it fixes over 30 Degrees from the North towards 
the Weft, the Declination of the Needle will be fo many Degrees from the South towards 
the Weft. 

But fince the Declination of the Needle is at Paris 12 Deg. 15 Min. N. W. for correcting 
that Defect, 12 Deg. 15 Min. muft always be added to the Degrees fhown by the Needle, 
when the Declination of the Wall is towards the Eaft ; and, on the contrary, when the Decli- 
nation is towards the Weft, the Declination of the Needle muft be fubftracted. 

As 



Chap. 7. of the Compafs. 1 19 

As fuppofing, as we have already done, that the Needle fixes over the 30th Degree towards 
the Eaft, the Declination of the Wall will be 42 Deg. 15 Min. from the South towards the 
Eaft ; but if the Needle fixes on the Weft-fide of the Wall, over the 30th Degree, the Decli- 
nation will be 17 Deg. 45 Min. from the South towards the Weft. 

If the South Point of the Needle tends towards the Wall, it is a Sign that the South is on 
the other Side of the Wall, and confequently that Side of the Wall, whofe Declination is to 
be found, will not be fhone upon by the Sun at Noon-, whence it's Declination will be from 
the North towards the Eaft: or Weft, according as it faces towards thofe Parts of the World* 
This will be more fully explained in the Treatife of Dialling. 

USE II. To take an Angle with the Compafs \ 

Let the Angle D A E be propofed to be meafured ; apply that Side of the Compafs, where Fig. 1 t . 
the North is marked, to one of the Lines forming the Angle, as A D : fo that the Needle 
may freely turn upon it's Pivot, arid when it refts, obferve what Number the North Point of 
the Needle ftands over \ and finding it, for Example, 80 Degrees, the Declination of the faid 
Line will be fo many Degrees. Afterwards take, in the fame manner, the Declination of the 
Line A E, which fuppofe 215 Degrees: fubftract 80 Degrees from 215 Degrees, there will 
remain 135, which fubftract from 180, and there will remain 45 Degrees, the Quantity of 
the Angle propofed to be meafured. 

But if the Declination of the Line A D had been, for example, but 30 Degrees, and the 
Line AE 265 Degrees, the Difference of thofe two Declinations, which would be 235 De- 
crees, would be too great to fubftract from 180 Degrees •, whence in this Cafe 180 Degrees 
muft be taken from 235 Degrees, and the Remainder 55 Degrees, will be the Angle pro* 
pofed. 

When Angles are meafured with the Compafs, there need not any regard be had to the 
Variation of the Needle, becaufe the Variation will always be the fame in all the different 
Pofitions of the Needle, provided at all times there be no Iron near it : and when the Com- 
pafs cannot be put nigh the Plane, by means of fome Impediment, it is fufrkient to place it 
parallel, as the Figure fhews, and the Effect will be the fame. 

USE III. To take the Plot of a Foreft, or Morafs. 

Let it be required to take the Plot of the Morafs ABCDE, in which one may enter. Fig. 12. 
To make thefe kinds of Operations, there muft be faftened two Sights to the Meridian Line 
of the Compafs ; now plant long Staffs upright, fo that they may be in Lines parallel to the 
Sides encompafling the Morafs, and place the Compafs upon it's Foot in a horizontal Pofition : 
then look at two of the Staffs thro' the Sights, putting always the Eye to that which is on 
the South Side of the Compafs ; and having drawn a Figure upon Paper fomething reprefent- 
ing the Plot of the Morafs, write upon the correfpondent Line the Number of Degrees 
which the Needle, when fixed fhews. At the fame time meafure the Length of each Side 
of the Morafs, and fet down their Lengths upon the correfpondent Lines of your Memorial. 
When you have gone round the Morafs, the Degrees denoted by the Needle, will ferve to 
form the Angles of the Figure, and the Length of each Line will determine the Plot of the 
Morafs propofed. 

Let us fuppofe, for Example, that having placed the Compafs along the Side A B, or which 
is all one, along a Line parallel to that Side, and placing the Eye next to the South Sight of 
the two Sights, two Staffs fet up in that Line are efpied. If the Needle fixes on the 30th 
Degree towards the Eaft, fet down the Number 30 upon the Line A B in the Memorial, 
and alfo 50 Toifes, the Length of the Side AB : afterwards fet the Compafs, with it's Foot, 
along the Side B C, or in the Direction of the Staffs, putting always the Eye next the South 
Sight. If the Needle fixes on the 100th Degree, I write that Number on the Line B C, and 
at the fame time 70 Toifes, the Length of the Side B C : doing thus quite round the Mo- 
rafs, you may fet down upon each correfpondent Line of the Memorial, the Numbers of De- 
grees and Toifes ; by means of which, the Plot may be drawn in the following manner, by 
help of a Scale and Protractor. 



Set down, one after the other, 
all the Angles obferved with the 
Compafs, and fubftrafl the leafi 
from it's next greater, as in this 
Table. 

Draw the Indefinite Line A B, of 50 equal Parts, reprefenting the 50 Toifes meafured ; 
make the exterior Angle at the Point B 70 Degrees, and draw the indefinite Line B C, on 
which lay off 70 Toifes from B to C. Make at the Point C an exterior Angle of 30 Degrees, 
and draw the indefinite Line CD, whofe Length let be 65 Toifes, conformable to the 
Length meafured. Make likewife at the Point D an exterior Angle of no Degrees, and

draw the Line DE of 70 Toifes. Laftly, Make an exterior Angle of 60 Degrees at the Point 
E, draw the Line A E of 94 Toifes, and the Plot will be compleated. 

Note, All the Angles of the Figure taken together, ought to make twice as many right 
Angles, wanting 2, as the Figure has Sides : As, for Example, the Figure of this Ufe, hav- 
ing 5 Sides, all the Angles added together make 540 Degrees, or 6 times 90, which may 
ferve to prove Operations. 

This Manner of taking Plots is expeditious enough, but it is very difficult to make Ope- 
rations exael with a Compafs, becaufe there may be Iron concealed nigh the Places whereat a 
body is obliged to place the Inftrument.

of Places. 

Plate 13. r^Ortification is the Art of putting a Place into fuch a State, that a fmall Body of Troops 
fj therein may advantageoufly refill a confiderable Army. 

The Maxims ferving as a Foundation to the Art of Fortification, are certain general Rules 
cflablifhed by Engineers, founded upon Reafon and Experience. 

The chief Engineer having examined the Extent and Situation of the Place to'be fortified, 
communicates hisDefign in a Plane and Profil, as may be ken in Plate 13. to which he com- 
monly adds aDifcourfe, orderly explaining the Materials employed by the Undertakers: and 
having fearched the Ground in feveral Parts of the Place propoled, makes a Computation of 
each Toife of Work, by means of which the Engineer may nighly eftimate the Charge of 
the whole Work, the Number of Workmen necefiary to perfect it, and alio the Time it will 
be done in. 

The Plane of a Fortification reprefents, by feveral Lines drawn horizontally, the Inclofure 
of a Place. 

This Defign contains feveral Lines drawn parallel to one another ; but the fir 11 and princi- 
pal Track, which ought to be marked by a Line more apparent than the others, reprefents 
the chief Inclofure of the Body of the Place between the Rampart and the Ditch ; fo that by 
the Plan and it's Scale, the Lengths and Breadths of all the Works compofing the Fortification 
may be known. (Fig. 1.) 

The Profil reprefents the principal Tracks appearing upon a plane Surface vertically cutting 
and feparating all the Works thro' the Middle. There is commonly a larger Scale to draw 
it, than to draw a Plan, for better diftinguifhing their Breadths, Heights, or Depths (as ap- 
pears in Fig. 3.). 

The Names of the chief Lines, and principal Angles, forming the Plane. 

Fig. 1. The Line A B, is called the exterior Side of the Polygon, and L M the interior Side 

thereof. 

L G the Demi-gorge of the Baltion, of which E G is the Flank, A E the Face, and A L 
the Capital. 

G H is the Courtain, and A H the Line of Defence Razant. 

The Figure ALGE reprefents a Demi-Baftion. 

The Angle A N B is the Angle of the Center. 

The Angle K AB is the Angle of the Polygon. 

The Angle I AE, made by the two Faces, is the flanquant Angle, or Angle of the Baflion. 

The Angle AEG made by the Face and the Flank, is called the Angle of the Shoulder. 

The Angle E G H, made by the Flank and the Courtain, is called the Angle of the Flank. 

The Angle EGB, made by the Flank and the Line of Defence, is called the interior flan- 
quant Angle. 

The Angle EDF, made by the two Razant Lines interfering one another towards the Mid- 
dle of the Courtain, is called the exterior flanquant Angle, or Angle of the Tcnaille. 

The Angle E H G, made by the Courtain and Line of Defence Razant, is called the di- 
minifhed Angle, which is always equal to that made by the Face of the Baflion and the Bafe, 
or exterior Side. 

Fundamental Maxims of Fortification. 

The principal Maxims may be reduced to fix. 

I. Every Side round about a Place, mull be flanked or defended with Flanks -, for if there 
be any Side about a Place not feen or defended by the Befieged, the Enemy may there lodge 
themfelves, and become Mailers of the Place in a fhort time. 

It-

Chap . o . of the Injlruments for Fortifications, 121 

It follows from this Maxim, that the flanquant Angle, or the Angle made by the Faces of 
the Baftion, being too acute, is defective, becaufe it's Point may eafily be blunted or broken 
by the Cannon of the Befiegers, and afterwards Miners may there work fafe in widening of 
the Breach. 

It is alfo a like Fault to round the Points of Baftions, for the fame Reafon. 

II. The Force, as much as poflible, muft be equally diftributed every where, for if there 
be any Side weaker than the reft, that will be it which the Enemy will attack ; therefore if 
from the Nature of the Ground, one Side be weaker than the others, ibme Work muft be 
there added to augment it's Force, in multiplying it's Defence. 

III. The flanquant Parts muft be no further remote from thofe which flank them, than a 
Mulquet-fhot will do Execution ; therefore the Line of Defence, or the Diftance from the 
Point of a Baftion to it's neighbouring Baftions, ought not much to exceed 125 Toifes, which 
js the Diftance that a Mufquet, well charged, will do Execution. 

IV. The Flanks of Baftions muft be large enough to contain at leaft 30 Soldiers in Front* 
and a or 5 Pieces of Cannon mounted on their Carriages, in order to defend well the Face of 
the Baftion attacked by the Enemy •, and fince the principal Defence arifes from Flanks, it is 
more proper for them to be perpendicular to the Line of Defence, than to have any other 
Situation. This Method was affigned by Count Pagan, and has been followed by the ableft 
Engineers fince his Time, and particularly by Monfieur Vauban, who, by his Angular Services, 
merited the Efteem of all warlike Nations, and able Engineers of his Time. 

V. The Fortrefs muft not be commanded by any Side out of the reach of Fire-Arms, 
which are Mufquets and Cannon ; but, on the contrary, it ought to command all Places 
round about. 

VI. The Works nigheft the Center, muft be higheft, and command thofe Places more 
diftant, fo that when the Enemy endeavour to make themfelves Matters of fome Outwork* 
they may be repulfed by thofe in the Body of the Place. 

To draw upon Paper a fortified Plane, according to the Method of Count Pagan. 

Let it be, for Example, an Hexagon : firft draw the Line AB 180 Toifes, for the exte- Fig. 1. 
rior Side of the Hexagon, and raife the Perpendicular CD from the Point C of 30 Toifes, 
then draw the Lines A D H, B D G, interfering each other in the Point D, and take 55 
Toifes from your Scale, to determine the Length of the Faces A E, B F : from the Point E 
draw the Flank E G, making a right Angle in the Point G, at the End of the Line of De- 
fence B G, and likewife the other Flank F H at right Angles to A H : finally, draw the 
Courtain G PI, and you will have one Side of the Hexagon fortified. The other Sides are 
fortified in the fame manner. About this Side of the Polygon thus fortified, you muft draw 
a Ditch, reprefented by the Lines AC, C B, parallel to the Faces of the Baftions, meeting 
each other towards the Middle of the Courtain in the Point C. This Ditch ought to be 
20 Toifes in Breadth, and 3 Toifes deep. The Ground taken out in making of the Ditch, 
ferves to form the Kainpart with it's Parapet, and the Glacis of the Covered Way, preferving 
the fineft for the Parapet of the Body of the Place, and the Covered Way -, for if the 
Ground be ftony, Cannon-Balis, coming from the Befiegers againft Parapets made with it, 
will make the Stones fly about, and annoy the Soldiers defending the Body of the Place. On 
the contrary, when the Ground is fine, the Bullets will but make Holes, and enter therein, 
provided Parapets have Breadth enough to deaden them : by Experience it is found, that 
Parapets muft confift of well-rammed Earth at leaft 20 Foot thick, to be Proof againft 
Cannon. 

The Parapet is made upon the Rampart 24 Feet broad, containing the Banqu tte, or little 
Bank, made parallel to the Faces, Flanks, and Courtains, forming the Inclofure of the Place. 

The Bafe of the Rampart is 15 Toifes broad, and is made parallel to the Courtains only, 
to the End that the Baftions may be full, and that there may be there found Earth in cafe of 
need, to make an Intrenchment. 

When any Baftion is left open, a Mine muft be made therein well arched, Bomb proof, 
and covered with Ground well rammed, and it muft be endeavoured to be made fo that the 
Rain-Water cannot get into it, to the End that Provifions put therein, may be preferved 
from time to time. 

The Covered Way is made parallel without the Ditch, about 5 Toifes broad, and upon it 
there is a Parapet made 6 Foot high, and a Banquette, at the Foot of the faid Parapet, 3 
Foot broad, and a Foot and a half high, fo that Soldiers may commodioufly ufe their Arms 
on the Top of the Parapet, whofe Top muft be floped, that is, having a Defcent or Slope 
going down 20 or 30 Toifes into the Country. 

There muft be no hollow Places about this Slope, for the Enemy to cover themfelves in ; 
therefore when an Engineer vifits the Fortification of a Place, it is requifite for him to examine 
the adjacent Parts, and have the hollow Places filled up, at leaft within the reach of a Muf- 
quet-fhot from the Covered Way ; and alfo to have all Places too high levelled, that fo thofe 
which defend the Place, may difcover all the adjacent Parts.

To draw the Profit of a Fortified Place upon Paper. 

fig, 2, Draw the indefinite Line ON, reprefenting the Level of the Country, and take 15 Toifes, 

which lay off from O to Q^, for denoting the Bafe of the Rampart * then lay off 20 Toifes 
from O to R, for the Breadth of the Ditch, over-againft one of the Faces of the Baftion, for 
it is wider over-againft the Courtain : lay off 5 Toifes from R to P, for the Breadth of the 
Covered Way ; and laftly, 20 or 30 Toifes from P to N, for the Bafe of the Glacis. Note* 
The longer the Bafe of the Glacis is made, the better will it be. 

After having determined the Breadths or Thickneffes ; the Heights above the Level of the 
Country, and Depths below, muft be as follows. 

Take 3 Toifes from your Scale, and raife from the Points O, Q^, Perpendiculars of that 
Height, for raifing above the Level of the Country the Platform of the Rampart, whereof 
O S is the interior Talud, or Slope, going up from the City to the Platform of the Ram- 
part S T ; which Platform ought to be 6 or 7 Toifes broad, that fo Cannon may be commo- 
dioufly ufed thereon, as alfo the other neceffary Munitions for the Defence of the Place. 

Note, The Rifing of the Rampart ought to be very eafy over-againft the Gorge of the 
Baftions, for Coaches to go eafily there up and down it. 

The Bafe of the Talud O Z, is made with new-dug Earth, equal to the Height all along 
the Courtains -, as if the Height be 3 Toifes, the Bafe of the Slope muft be alfo 3 Toifes. 

But at the Entry of the Baftions, the Bafe muft be at leaft twice the Height •, that is, if 
the Height of the Slope be 3 Toifes, the Bafe of it muft be at leaft 6 or 8 Toifes, for 
Coaches to go up it. 

When the Rampart is formed, and the Earth fufficiently raifed upon it, which cannot be 
done but with Time and Precaution, in well ramming it every 2 Feet in Height, and laying 
Fafcines to keep it together ; a Parapet is made upon the Earth of the Rampart, 6 Feet of 
interior Height, and 4 Feet of exterior Lleight (for the Top of the Earth to have a Declivity), 
to difcover any thing beyond the Ditch, and being mounted upon the Banquette, the Covered 
Way may be feen, and defended in cafe of Need. 

The Bafe of the Parapet X Y, ought to be about 4 Toifes broad, to the End that the Top 
thereof may be at leaft 20 Feet broad. At the Bottom of the interior Slope of the Parapet, 
there is made a little Bank 3 Feet wide, and a Foot and a half high, fo that the Parapet will 
be 4 4 Feet above the Bank, which is fufficient for Soldiers to ufe their Fire- Arms on the 
Top thereof. 

Care muft be taken to lay Beds of Fafcines every Foot in height, between the Earth of the 
Parapet •, and in order to keep the Earth of the faid Parapet from crumbling, it is covered 
with Grafs-Turfs, cut with a Turfing-Iron, from fome neighbouring Common, about 15 
Inches long, and 10 broad. 

Now to lay thefe Turfs, you muft place the firft Bed, or Row of them, very level all 
along the Diftance of feveral Toifes, and then lay the Turfs of the fecond Bed fo, that the 
Joints of the firft may be covered with them, and the Joints of the fecond likewne covered 
with the Joints of the third, &amp;c. that fo they may all make a good joining. 

It is fufficient to give 2 Inches of Declivity to one Foot in height, for the interior Slope % 
and about 4 Inches to one Foot in height, for the exterior Slope of the Parapet. Note, There 
ought to be Gardiners to cut and lay the Turfs. 

At the Foot of the exterior Slope of the Parapet and the Rampart, there is left a little 
Berm (marked Qj, about 4 Feet wide, for retaining the loofe Ground falling down from the 
Slope. 

Q^B reprefents the inward Slope of the Ditch, which is 3 Toifes deep, and BK is the ex- 
terior Slope. If the Ground be brittle, they muft have more Slope given them, for hindering it's 
falling to the Bottom of the Ditch. The Line K P reprefents the Platform of the Covered 
Way, which muft be 5 Toifes broad. P A reprefents the Parapet of the Covered Way, with 
it's Banquette at the Foot thereof. The whole muft be 6 Feet high, for covering thofe 
which are on the Covered Way. 

The fuperior Slope of the Slope A N, ought to be made of fine Earth, the Stones in 
which, if there be any, muft be taken away with an Iron Rake, and buried at the Foot of 
the Slope, fo that Cannon Balls fhot from the Enemy upon the Covered Way, may enter 
therein, without making the broken Pieces of the Stones fly about upon the Covered Way. 

To lay off the Plan of a Fortification upon the Ground. 

Let, for Example, the Plan of the firft Figure be propofed to be drawn upon the Ground. 

Inftead of a Scale and Compaffes, there muft be ufed Staffs, the Toife, and Lines ; there- 
Fore, after having well examined the Ground, and confidered where the Gates and Baftions 
muft be made, which are commonly in the Middle of the Courtains, long Staffs muft firft 
be placed, where the flanquant Angles of the Baftions are intended to be. 

Now having planted a long Staff upright, in the Place fixed on for the Point of the Ba- 
ftion (marked A), meafure very exactly, with a Toife, or Chain, 90 Toifes ; at the End of 
which plant a Staff (marked C) : from the Point C continue that Line 90 Toifes more ; at 
the End of which plant another Staff, which will be the Point of the Baftion B. In the 

* mean 



Chap. 8. of the Infiruments for Fortif cations. ti% 

mean time you are meafuring with Chains or Lines, fome Workmen mud follow, and make 
a little Trench from Staff to Staff, before the Lines are taken away. 

After which, a Perpendicular muft be drawn from the Staff C, to the Track A C B. 

To draw the faid Perpendicular, meafure two or three Toifes from C to A, where plant a 
Staff; meafure likewife from C towards B an equal Number of Toifes* at the End of which 
plant a fecond Staff: Take two Lines very equal, and having made Loops in the two Ends of 
each of them, put thofe Loops about each of the Staffs, and holding the two other Ends of 
the Lines in your Hands, ftretch them 'till they join upon the Ground, and in their point of 
Junction plant a third Staff. Laftly, Faften a Line tight to the Point C, and that third 
Staff, by which make a Track, which will be perpendicular to the Line A C B. 

Meafure 30 Toifes from the Point C along the Track, at the End of which plant another 
Staff very upright, which will fhew the Point D of the Plan. Return to the Staff A, from 
which to the Staff D make a Track ; along which from the Point A meafure 55 Toifes to- 
wards D, for the Face of the Baftion A E ; plant a Staff in the Point E, for denoting the 
Angle de VEpaule. 

Go to the Point B, and there make the fame Operations for drawing the Face B F, and 
plant a Staff at the Angle de VEpaule F. 

Produce B F from D, towards G •, and alfo A E from D towards H ; then meafure with 
the Scale of the Plane the Lines D G, D H, and lay off their Lengths on the Ground from 
D to G, and from G to H, where plant Staffs : After which it will be eafy to draw the 
Flanks EG, FH, and the Courtain G H. 

By this means you will have one Front of a fortified Place, drawn on the Ground j the 
others may be drawn in the fame manner by Staffs and Lines. 

Note, It will not be improper to examine with a Semi-Circle, or other fuch Inftrument 9 
whether the Angles drawn upon the Ground are equal to thofe taken off of the Plane, and to 
rectify them before the Works are begun. 

Care muft likewife from time to time be taken, that the Tracks are followed ; for without 
thefe Precautions there will fometimes happen great Deformities. 

Of the ConflruEfion of the Outworks. 

The Outworks of a Fortification, are thofe Works made without the Ditch of a fortified 
Place, to cover it and augment it's Defence. 

The moft ordinary kinds of thefe Works, are the Ravelins or Half- Moons, which are 
formed between the two Baftions upon the Flanquant Angle of the Counterfcarp, and before 
the Courtain, for covering the Gates and Bridges commonly made in the Middle of the Cour- 
tains, as the Figures P P fhow. 

The Ravelins are compofed of two Faces furniftied with one or two little Banks, and a good 
Parapet raifed on the Side next the Country ; and two Demigorges, without a Parapet, on 
the Side next to the Place, with an Entrance and Slope for mounting the great Ditch on the 
Platform of the Ravelin. 

In each Ravelin there is built a Guard-Houfe, to fhelter the Soldiers neceffary for it's De- 
fence, from the Injuries of Weather •, but it is proper for the Guard-Houfe to be built in 
form of a Redoubt, with Battlements all round, for the Soldiers, in cafe of being attacked* 
to retire in, and obtain fome Capitulation, before they lay down their Arms. 

To draw a Ravelin before a Courtain, open your Compaffes the Length of the interior Side 
of the Polygon, and having fixed one of the Points in one of the Ends of the Line, with the 
other Point defcribe an Arc without the Counterfcarp ; likewife fet one Foot of the Compaffes 
in the other End of the interior Side, and with the other Point defcribe a fecond Arc, cutting 
the firft in a Point, which will be the Point or Flanquant Angle of the Ravelin: then lay a 
Ruler on the aforefaid Interferon, and upon each of the Ends of the interior Side of the Po- 
lygon, for drawing the Faces of the Ravelin, which will terminate to the Right and Left up- 
on the Edge of the Counterfcarp. The two Demigorges are" drawn from the End of each 
Face, to the Rentrant Angle of the Counterfcarp. 

But that the Flanquant Angle may not be too acute, it's Capital R S muft be but about 40 
Toifes-, and proceed with the reft, as before. 

Sometimes a fimilar Work is made before the Point of a Baftion ; and fince it's Gorge is 
built upon the Edge of the Counterfcarp, which is commonly rounded over-againft the Point 
of the Baftions, this Work is called a Half-Moon (becaufe it's Gorge is in the Form of an 
Arc) : They are very often confounded, and the greateft Part of the Soldiers give, without 
diftincYion, the Name of Half-Moons to Ravelins made before the Courtains. 

The Defe£t of this Work is, that it is too diftant from the Flanks of the Baftions, for being 
fufHciently defended by them ; therefore a Half- Moon muft not be made before the Point of a 
Baftion, unlefs at the lame time there arc made other Out- Works to theRight and Left before 
the adjacent Courtains, to defend it. 

It is proper lor thefe Works to be lined with Walls, as well as the Body of the Place •, for 
when they are rot, the Ground muft have lb great a Slope, that it will be eafy to mount the 
Works. 

In 



124 ^ e Conjlruciion and Ufes B o o k I V. 

In the mean time the new-dug Earth the Works are made with, muft fettle at leaft a 
Year or two before the Walls are built, to the End that the Walls may not be thrown down 
by it after they are built. 

Conflruclion of the Hornworks. 

Fig. 3. Thefe kind of Works are commonly made before the Courtains, and becaufe the Expence 

in making them is greater than the Expence in making the Ravelins, they are not made with- 
out abfolute neceffity ; they ferve to cover fome Side of the Place, weaker than the others ; 
they likewife ferve to occupy an Height, which cannot be done by Perfons inclofed in the 
Body of the Place. 

Now to draw a Hornwork, firft raife the Indefinite Perpendicular 1, 2, on the Middle of 
the Courtain ; and to this Line draw two Parallels 3, 4, and 5, 6, from the Angles of the 
Shoulders. Thefe two Parallels, which are called the Wings of the Hornwork, ought to 
draw their defence from the Faces of the Baftions ; whence their Length ought not much to 
exceed 120 Toifes, counting from the Shoulders. Thro' the Ends of the Wings draw the 
Line 4, 6, which will be the exterior Side of the Hornwork, and is divided into two equal 
Parts in the Point 7, by the Perpendicular 1,2; then take half that exterior Side in your Com- 
paffes, and lay it off upon the Sides, from 4 to 8, and from 6 to 9 ; draw the Lines 4, 9, 
and 6, 8, which interfering one another in the Point 10, will form the Angle of the Tenaille y 
that reprefents a Work called the Simple Tenaille, which is common enough made before the 
Courtaihs, with a little Ravelin without the Ditch, between the two Saliant Angles, and over- 
againft the Middle of the Rentrant Angle. 

But to ft rengthen this Work, there is added thereto two Demi-baftions, and a Courtain be- 
tween them; which is better than two fimple Rentrant Angles. 

To draw the Demi-baftions, bifect the Line 4, 10, in the Point n •, and likewife the Line 
10, 6, in the Point 12-, then from the Points 11 and 12, draw to the Middle of the Cour- 
tain of the Place, as at the Point 1, the occult Lines 121, m, by which means will be had 
the little Courtain 13 14 of the Hornwork, the two Flanks 11 13, 12 14, and the two Faces 
114, 126. 

The Sides of thefe Works, which are next to the Country (as the Demi-baftions, the 
Courtain, and the Wings of the Hornwork are), ought to be furnifhed with a good Parapet 
of fine Earth well rammed, 18 or 20 Feet thick, and 6 Feet high before, containing a Ban- 
quette^ like that in the Body of a Place ; obferving at all times, that the Parapets of the 
"Works nigher the Center of the Place, muft be higher above the Level of the Country, than 
thofe Works more diftant; to the End that when the Befiegers have made themfelves Mafters 
of fome Outwork, the Befieged, defending the Body of the Place, feeing them altogether 
uncovered, may diflodge them therefrom. 

Thefe Parapets ought to be fuftained by a Rampart, whofe Platform having a Banquette, 
is three or four Toifes wide •, but when Earth is wanting, we muft be content to make llveral 
little Banks upon one another eijghteen Inches high, and three or four Feet broad ; and the 
Parapet ought to be about 4 7 Feet above the higheft Bank, for covering the Soldiers : the 
Top of the Parapet muft be floped, gradually defcending towards the Country, fo that the 
Befieged may fee the Enemy. 

The parts of thofe Works, which are next the Place, muft be without a Parapet, and only 
inclofed with a fingle Wall, or a Row of Palifadoes, to avoid the Surprizes of the Enemy. 
It is on this fide that a Gate muft be (for a Communication from the Works to the Body of the 
Place); as alfo a Guard-Houfe, for covering the Soldiers defigned for it's defence. 

All thefe Works ought to be environed with a Ditch 10 or 12 Toifes broad, communicat- 
ing with the Ditch of the Body of the Place, and alfo as deep. 

On the outfide of that Ditch is made a Covered Way five or fix Toifes broad, with a Pa- 
rapet, and it's Bank, commonly furnifhed with an enclofure of ftrong Palifadoes, drove 4 or 
5 Feet into the Ground. The Top of that Parapet muft be floped next to the Country, and 
if it can be produced 20 or 30 Toifes it will be better : for a Slope (or Glacis) cannot be too 
long \ becaufe, by means thereof, the Enemy cannot approach the Body of the Place, with- 
out being difcovered. 

The Outworks of which we have fpoken, are the moft common ones : There are many 
other forts of them, which we fhall not mention, it requiring a great Volume. 

How to meafure the Works of Fortifications. 

The Ground of which the Ramparts and Parapets are formed, is generally taken out of 
the Ditches made about the Place ; to know the Quantity of which, meafure the Cavity of the 
Ditches, and reduce it to Cubic Toifes. As, for example, If the Ditch over-againft the Face 
of a Baftion, be 50 Toifes long, 20 broad, and 4 deep •, multiply the Length by the Breadth, 
and the Product will be 1000 fquare Toifes, which multiplied by 4 the Depth, and there will 
arife 4000 Cubic Toifes. 

Note, That fince there is a Neceffity to give the Ground a great Slope, to keep it from 
crumbling to the Bottom, the Ditch will be wider at the Top than at the Bottom ; whence, 

if 



Chap. 8. of the Infiruments for Fortifications. 1 25 

if a Ditch be 20 Feet broad in the Middle of it's Depth, at the Top it muft at leaft be 2.1 
Toifes broad, and j8 Toifes at the Bottom : Thole 22 Toifes added to 18, make 40, whofe 
half 20, is the mean Breadth to be ufed. 

The Stone, or Brick- work, keeping together the Earth, ought to have thicknefs propor- 
tionable to it's height, and alfo about a Foot in Talud or Slope, the Fleight of every Toife. 

If, for Example, a Wall be built to fuftain the Earth of the Rampart of a Place, and it is 
6 Toifes high, the leaft thicknefs that can be given to that height, at the Top, muft be 3 
Feet, and at the Bottom, juft above the Foundation, 9 Feet, becaufe of it's Talud of 1 Foot 
every Toife in height: Now thefe two thicknefies, 9 and 3 make 12, whofe half 6 Feet is 
the mean thicknefs of the Wall; and, confequently, to line the Face of a Baftion, 50 Toifes 
long, 6 Toifes high, and one Toife of mean thicknefs, there muft be 300 Cubic Toifes of 
Walling, excluding the Foundation, which cannot be determined without knowing the 
Ground. Befides t h i s &gt; there are commonly made Counter-Forts for fuftaining the Earth, 
and hindering it's preffing too much againft the Walls. Thefe Counter-Forts ought to be 
funk in firm Ground, and enter in the dug Earth, at leaft a Toife ; they are 7 or 8 Feet 
broad at the Root, that is, on the Side where they are faftened to the Wall, and 4 or 5 
Feet at the End, going into the Earth of the Rampart, which amounts to one Toife of Sur- 
face, in fuppofing (as we have already) that the Root is 7 Feet, and the End going into the 
Earth of the Rampart 5 Feet, which makes 12 Feet, half of which being 6, is the mean 
thicknefs ; and fuppofing them 4 Toifes in height, one with another, each will be 4 Cubic 
Toifes : and fince there ought to be 10 in the Extent of 50 Toifes, the Stone, or Brick- Work 
of 10 Counter-Forts will be 40 Cubic Toifes : So that there will be about 1000 Cubic Toifes 
to wall the two Faces, and the Flanks of a Baftion, and to wall a Courtain, 80 Toifes in 
length, there muft be about 600 Cubic Toifes of Stone, or Brick- Work; whence the Wall- 
ing lor the whole Place may be eafily computed. 

Note, It is better to make an Eftimation too great, than too little. 

It remains that we fay fomething of the Carpenters Toife, required to conftruct Bridges 
and Gates, and other Works of the like Nature. 

In meafuring of Timber, we reduce it to Solives. 

A Solive is a Piece of Timber 12 Feet long, and 36 Inches in furface ; that is, 6 Inches 
broad, and 6 thick, which makes 3 Cubic Feet of Timber, being the feventy fecond Part of 
a Cubic Toife. 

We mail give here two Ways of Calculation, to the End that the one may prove the 
other. 

The firft is, to reduce the Bignefs of the Piece of Timber into Inches, that is, the Inches 
of it's Breadth and Thicknefs, and after having multiplied thefe two Quantities by one an^ 
other, the Product muft be multiplied by the Toifes, Feet and Inches of it's Length, which 
laft Product being divided by 72, the Quotient will give the Number of Solives contained in 
the Piece of Timber. 

The Reafon o f this is, becaufe 72 Pieces, 1 Inch Bafe, and a Toife long, make a 
Solive. 

Suppofe, for Example, a great Piece of Timber is to be reduced to Solives, whofe length 
is 2 Toifes, 4 Feet, 6 Inches, and 12 by 15 Inches Bafe; multiply 15 by 12, the Product is 
180 fquare Inches, which again multiplied by 2 Toifes, 4 Feet, 6 Inches, and the Product 
495, divided by 12, will give 6 - g Solives. 

The fecond Method is founded upon this, that a Solive contains 3 Cubic Feet. 

As, for Example, If a Piece of Timber (the fame as before) be 2 Toifes, 4 Feet, 6 Inches 
long, and Bafe be 12 by 15 Inches; multiplying 12 by 15, the Product will be 180 fquare 
Inches-, the \ith Part of that Number, which is 15, being confidered as Feet, makes 2 
Toifes 3 Feet, which, multiplied by the Length 2 Toifes, 4 Feet, 6 Inches, make 6 Solives, 
5 Feet, and 3 Inches : So that there wants but 9 Inches, or the eighth Part of a Toife, to 
make 7 Solives, as in the Calculation of the firft Method.

CHAP. I. 

Of the Theodolite. 

Fig b. f "■ "'\ HIS Theodolite confifts of a Brafs Circle, cut in form of the Figure B, ufually 

about 12 or 14 Inches in Diameter, whofe Limb is divided into 360 Degrees, and 
A each- Degree into as many Minutes, either Diagonally, or otherwise, as the largenefs 
of the Inftrument will admit. 

Underneath, at the Places c c of this Circle, are fixed two little Pillars d d, for fupporting 
an Axis, upon which is fixed a Telefcope, with a fquare Brafs Tube, having two GlafTes 
therein, for better perceiving Objects at a great diftance ; whence this Telefcope may be 
raifed or lowered, according as Objects be Horizontal or not. The Ends of the aforefaid 
Pillars are joined by the Piece gg, upon the Middle of which is foldered a Socket with it's 
Screw, for receiving the Top of the Ball and Socket E. Upon and about the Center of the 

Fig. C. Circle B, muft the Index C move, which is a Circular Brafs Plate, having upon the Middle 

thereof a Box and Needle, orCompafs, whofe Meridian Line anfwers to the Fiducial Line 
a a. At the Places bb of the Index are fixed two little Pillars for fupporting an Axis, carry- 
ing a Telefcope in the Middle thereof, whofe Line of Collimation muft be anfwerable to the 
Fiducial Line a a of the Index. This Telefcope hath a fquare Brafs Tube, and two GlafTes 
therein, and may be raifed or lowered, like that beforementioned. At each End of one of 
the perpendicular Sides of each Tube of the Telefcopes, are fixed four fmall Sights for view- 
ing nigh Objects thorough them. 

The Ends of the Index a a are cut Circular, fo as to fit the Divifions upon the Limb of the 
Circle B, and when the faid Limb B is Diagonally divided, the Fiducial Line at one End 
cf the Index fhews the Degrees and Minutes upon the Limb. But when the Limb is only 
divided into Degrees, and every 30th Minute, we have a much better Contrivance for find- 
ing, the Degrees, and every 2 Minutes upon the Limb, which is thus : Let the half Arc p a 
of one End of the Index contain exactly 8 Degrees of the Limb •, then divide the faid half 
Arc into 15 equal Parts, at every five of which fet the Numbers 10, 20, 30, beginning 
from the Fiducial Line or middle of the Index. Now each of thefe equal Parts will be 32 
Minutes : Therefore if you have a mind to fet the Fiducial Line of the Index to any Num- 
ber of Degrees, and every 2 Minutes upon the Limb •, for Example, to 40 Degrees 10 Mi- 
nutes ; move the Index fo, the Fiducial Line being between the 40th Degree, and the 40th 
Degree and 30 Minutes, that the Line of Divifion, numbered 10 upon the Index, may ex- 
actly fall upon fome Line of Divifion of the Limb ; and then the Fiducial Line will fhew 40 
Degrees, 10 Minutes. 

Again : Suppofe the Fiducial Line being between the 50th Degree and 30 Minutes, and 
the 51ft, then that Line of Divifion, of equal Parts on the Index, exactly falling upon fome 
Line of the Divifions of the Limb, will give the even Minutes above 50 Degrees 30 Minutes 
the Fiducial Line ftands at. As fuppofe the 4th Line of Divifion of the Index Hands exactly 
againft fome Line of Divifion of the Limb; then the Minutes above 40 Degrees 30 Minutes 
will be 8, that the Fiducial Line ftands at : Underftand the fame of others. 

Fig. D. is the Brafs Ball and Socket, in which goes the Plead of the three-legged Staff E, 
for fupporting the Inftrument when ufing : Thefe three Legs are moveable by means of 
Joints, and may be taken fhorter by half at the Places a a a y by means of Screws, for better 
conveniency of Carriage.

CHAP. II. 

Of the ConflruElion and Ufe of the Plain-Table^ and Circum- 

fere?itor. 

TH E Table itfclf is a Parallelogram of Oak, or other Wood, about 15 Inches long, Fig. F. 
and 12 broad, confiding of two feveral Boards, round which are Ledges of the fame 
Wood •, the two oppofite of which being taken off, and the Spangle unfkrewed from the Bot- 
tom, the aforefaid two Boards may be taken afunder for eafe and conveniency of Carriage. 
For the binding of the two Boards and Ledges faff, when the Table is fet together, there 
is a Box Jointed-Frame, about \ of an Inch broad, and of the fame thicknefs as the Boards, 
which may be folded together in 6 Pieces. This Frame is fo contrived, that it may be taken 
off and put on the Table at pleafure, and may go eafily on the Table, either fide being up- 
wards. This Frame alfo is to faften a Sheet of Paper upon the Table, by forcing down the 
Frame, and fqueezing in all the Edges of the Paper •, fo that it lies firm and even upon the 
Table, that thereby the Plot of a Field, or other Inclofure, may conveniently be drawn up- 
on it. 

On both fides this Frame, near the inward Edge, are Scales of Inches fubdivided into 10 
equal Parts, having their proper Figures fet to them. The Ufes of thefe Scales of Inches, are 
for ready drawing of Parallel Lines upon the Paper ; and alfo for fhifting your Paper, when 
one Sheet will not hold the whole Work. 

Upon one fide of the faid Box Frame, are projected the 360 Degrees of a Circle from a 
Brafs Center-Hole in the Middle of the Table. Each of thefe Degrees are fubdivided into 
30 Minutes ; to every 10th Degree is fet two Numbers, one expreffing the proper Number 
of Degrees, and the other the Complement of that Number of Degrees to 360. This is 
done to avoid the trouble of Subftraction in taking of Angles. 

On the other Side of this Frame, are projected the 180 Degrees of a Semi-Circle from a 
Brafs Center-FIole, in the Middle of the Table's length, and about a fourth Part of it's breadth. 
Each of thefe Degrees are fubdivided into 30 Minutes ; to every 10th Degree is fet likewife, 
as on the other fide, two Numbers ; one expreffing the proper Number of Degrees, and the 
other the Complement of that Number of Degrees to 180, for the fame Reafon, as 
before. 

The manner of projecting the Degrees on the aforefaid Frame, is, by having a large Circle 
divided into Degrees, and every 30 Minutes : For then placing either of the Brafs Center- 
Floles on the Table, in the Center of that Circle fo divided, and laying a Ruler from that Center 
to the Degrees on the Limb of the Circle ; where the Edge of the Ruler cuts the Frame, 
make Marks for the Correfpondent Degrees on the Frame. 

The Degrees thus infertecl on the Frame, are of excellent ufe in wet or ftormy Weather, 
when you cannot keep a Sheet of Paper upon the Table. Alfo thefe Degrees will make the 
Plain-Table a Theodoike, or a Semi-Circle, according as what fide of the Frame is upper- 
moft. 

There is a Box, with a Needle and Card, covered with a Glafs, fixed to one of the long 
Sides of the Table, by means of a Screw, that thereby it may be taken off. This Box and 
Needle is very ufeful for placing the Inftrument in the fame Pofition upon every remove. 

There belongs to this Inftrument a Brafs Socket and Spangle, fere wed with three Screws to 
the Bottom of the Table, into which muft be put the Head of the three-legged Staff, which 
may be fcrewed faft, by means of a Screw in the Side of the Socket. 

There is alio an Index belonging to the Table, which is a large Brafs Ruler, at leaft 16 
Inches long, and 2 Inches broad, and fo thick as to make it ftrong and firm, having a Hoped 
P.dge, called the Fiducial Edge, and two Sights fcrewed perpendicularly on it, of the lame 
Height. They muft be fet on the Ruler perfectly at the fame Diftance from the Fiducial 
Edge. Upon this Index it is ulual to have many Scales of equal Parts, as alfo Diagonals, and 
Lints of Chord?,

Fig. G. THIS Inftrument confifts of a Brafs Index and Circle, all of a Piece •, the Index is com- 

monly made about 14 Inches long, an Inch and half broad, and of a convenient Thicknefs. 
The Diameter of the aforenamed Circle is about 7 Inches. On this Circle is made a Card, 
whofe Meridian Line anfwers to the Middle of the Breadth of the Index : That Card is divided 
into 360 Degrees. There is a Brafs Ring foldered on the Circumference of the Circle, on 
which fcrews another Ring with a flat Glafs in it ; fo that they make a kind of Box to contain 
the Needle fufpended upon the Pivot placed in the Center of the Circle. 

There are alfo two Sights to fere w on, or Aide up and down the Index, like thofe before- 
named, belonging to the Index of the Plain-Table •, as likewife a Spangle and Socket fcrewed 
on to the back-fide of the Circle, for putting the Plead of the Staff in. 

SECTION II. 

Of the Vfe of the Plain-Table and Circumferentor. 

BUT firft, it is neceffary to know how to fet the Parts of the Plain-Table together, to 
make it fit for ufe. 

When you would make your Table fit for ufe, lay the two Boards together, and alfo the 
Ledges at the Ends in their due Places, according as they are marked. Then lay a Sheet of 
white Paper all over the Table, which muft be ftretched over the Boards, by putting on the 
Box Frame, which binds both the Paper to the Boards, and the Boards to one another : Then 
fcrew the Socket on the back-fide the Table, and alfo the Box and Needle in it's due Place, 
the Meridian Line of the Card lying parallel to the Meridian or Diameter of the Table ; 
which Diameter is a Right Line drawn upon the Table, from the Beginning of the Degrees 
thro' the Center, and fo to the End of the Degrees. Then put the Socket upon the Head 
of the Staff, and there fcrew it : Alfo put the Sights upon the Index, and lay the Index on 
the Table. So is your Inftrument prepared for ufe, as a Plain-Table, Theodolite, or Semi- 
Circle. 

But Note, It is either a Theodolite, or Semi-Circle, according as the Theodolite or 
Semi-Circular Side of the Frame is upwards ; for when you ufe your Inftrument as a Plain- 
Table, you may place your Center in any part of the Table, which you judge moft proper 
for bringing on the Work you intend. But if you ufe your Inftrument as a Theodolite, the 
Index muft be turned about upon the Brafs Center-Hole in the Middle of the Table ; and if 
for a Semi-Circle, upon the other Brafs Center-Hole, by means of a Pin or Needle placed 
therein. 

If you have a mind to ufe this Inftrument, as a Circumferentor, you need only fcrew the 
Box and Needle to the Index, and both of them to the Head of the Staff, with a Brafs Screw- 
Pin fitted for that purpofe : So that the Staff being fixed in any Place, the Index and Sights, 
may turn about at pleafure, without moving the Staff.

Plate 14. Suppofe E K, KG, to be two Hedges, or two Sides of a Field, including the Angle 

Fig. i. E KG, and it is required to draw upon the Table an Angle equal thereto : Firit place your In- 

ftrument as near the Angular Point K as conveniency will permit, turning it about, 'till the 
North End of the Needle hangs directly over the Meridian Line in the Card, and then fcrew 
the Table faft. Then upon your Table, with your ProtracTing-Pin (which is a fine Needle 
put into a Piece of Box or Ivory, neatly turned) or Compals-Point, affign any Point at 
pleafure upon the Table, and to that Point apply the Edge of the Index, turning the Index 
about upon that Point, 'till thro' the Sights thereof you fee a Mark fet up atE, or parallel to 
the Line E K : And then with your Protra£ting-Pin, Compafs-Point, or Pencil, draw a Line 
by the Side of the Index to the affigned Point upon the Table. Then (the Table remaining 
immoveable) turn the Index about upon the forementioned Point, and direct the Sights to the 
Mark fet up at G, or parallel thereto, that is, fo far diftant from G, as your Inftrument is 
placed from K ; and then by the Side of the Index draw another Line to the affigned Point. 
Thus will there be drawn upon the Table two Lines reprefenting the Hedges E K, and 
K G ; and which include an Angle equal to the Angle E K G. And tho' you know not the 
Quantity of this Angle, yet you may find it, if required : For in working by this Inftrument, 
it is fufficient only to give the Proportions of Angles, and not their Quantities in Degrees, as 
in working by the Theodolite, Serni-Circle, or Circumferentor. Alfo in working by the 
Plain-Table, there needs no Protraction at all, for you will have upon your Table the true 

* Figuie

Chap. 2. of the Plain-Table ) and Circumferentor, 129 

Figure of any Angle or Angles that you obferve in the Field, in their true Pofition;, without 
any further trouble. 

II. How to find the Quantity of an Angle in the Field, by the Plain-Table, conftdered as a 

Theodolite, or Semi-Circle. 

Let it firft be required to find the Quantity of the Angle EKG by the Plain-Table, as a Fig. i. 
Theodolite : Place your Inftrument at K, with the Theodolite fide of the Frame upwards, 
laying the Index upon the Diameter thereof-, then turn the whole Inftrument about (the In- 
dex itill rcfting upon the Diameter) 'till thro' the Sights you efpy the Mark at E : Then fcrew- 
jne the Inftrument faft there, turn the Index about upon the Theodolite Center-Hole in the 
Middle of the Table, 'till thro' the Sights you efpy the Mark at G. Then note what Degrees 
on the Frame of the Table are cut by the Index, and thofe will be the Quantity of the Angle 
EKG fought. 

You muft proceed in the fame manner for finding the Quantity of an Angle by the Plain- 
Table as a Semi-Circle ; only put the Semi-Circle fide of the Frame upwards, and move the 
Index upon the other Center-Hole. 

III. How to obferve the Quantity of an Angle by the Circumferentor. 

If it be required to find the Quantity of the former Angle EKG by the Circumferentor, Fig. i. 
Firft, place your Inftrument (as before) at K, with the Flower-de-luce in the Card towards 
you. Then direct your Sights to E, and obferve what Degrees are cut by the South-End of 
the Needle, which let be 296 ; then turning the Inftrument about (the Flower-de-luce always 
towards you), direct the Sights to G, noting then alfo, what Degrees are cut by the South- 
End of the Needle, which fuppofe 182. This done (always) fubftract the leffer from the 
greater, as in this Example 182 from 296, and the Remainder is 114 Degrees ; which is the 
true Quantity of the Angle E K G. 

Again; The Inftrument (landing at K, and the Sights being directed toE, as before, fup- 
pofe the South-End of the Needle had cut 79 Degrees ; and then directing the Sights to G 5 
the fame End of the Needle had cut 325 Degrees. Now, if from 325 you fubftract 79, the 
Remainder is 246. But becaufe this Remainder 246 is greater than 180, you muft therefore 
fubftract 246 from 360, and there will remain 114, the true Quantity of the Angle 
fought. 

This adding and fubftracting for finding of Angles may feem tedious to fome. But here 
note, That for quick difpatch the Circumferentor is as good an Inftrument as any, for in go- 
ing round a Field, or in furveying a whole Manor, you are not to take notice of the Quan- 
tity of any Angle ; but only to obferve what Degrees the Needle cuts : as hereafter will be 
man ife fi- 
ll S E II. Hew by the Plain-Table, to take the Plot of a Field at one Station within the 
fame, from whence all the Angles of the fame Field may be feen. 

Having entered upon the Field to furvey, your firft work muft be to fet up fome vifible Fig. 2. 
Mark at each Angle thereof; which being done, make choice of fome convenient Place about 
the Middle of the Field, from whence all the Marks may be feen, and there place your Table 
covered with a Sheet of Paper, with the Needle hanging directly over the Meridian Line of 
the Card (which you muft always have regard to, efpecially when you are to furvey many 
Fields together). Then make a Mark about the Middle of the Paper, to reprefent that part 
of the Field where the 7'able ftands ; and laying the Index upon this Point, direct your 
Sights to the feveral Angles where you before placed Marks, and draw Lines by the Side of 
the Index upon the Paper. Then meafure the Diftance of every of thefe Marks from your 
Table, and by your Scale fet the fame Diftances upon the Lines drawn upon the Table, mak- 
ing fmall Marks with your Protracting-Pin, or Compafs-Point, at the End of every of them. 
Then Lines being drawn from the one to the other of thefe Points, will give you the exact 
Plot of the Field ; all the Lines and Angles upon the Table being proportional to thofe of 
the Field. 

Example ; Suppofe the Plot of the Field A B C D E F was to be taken. Having placed 
Marks in the feveral Angles thereof, make choice of fome proper Place about the Middle of 
the Field, as at L, from whence you may behold all the Marks before placed in the feveral 
Angles ; and there place your Table. Then turn your Inftrument about, 'till the Needle 
hangs over the Meridian Line of the Card, denoted by the Line N S. 

Your Table being thus placed with a Sheet of Paper thereon, make a Mark about the 
Middle of your Table, which fhall reprefent the Place where your Table ftands. Then, ap- 
plying your Index to this Point, direct the Sights to the firft Mark at A, and the Index rett- 
ing there, draw a Lire by the Side thereof to the Point L. Then with your Chain meafure 
the Diftance from I.,, the Piace where your Table ftands, to A, the firft Mark, which fup- 
pofe 8 Chains, 10 Links. Then take 8 Chains 10 Links from any Scale, and let that Di- 
ftance upon the Line from L to A 

Then directing the Sights to B, draw a Line by the Side of the Index, as before, and 
iriCifure the Diftance from your Table at L, to the Mark at B, which fuppofe 8 Chains 7/5 

L 1 Links. 



j 30 ^Fhe Conjlruciion and Ufes Book IV* 

Links. This diftance taken from your Scale, and applied to your Table from L to B, will 
give the Point B, reprefenting the fecond Mark. 

Then direct the Sights to the third Mark C, and draw a Line by the Side of the Index, 
meafuring the Diftance from L to C, which fuppofe 10 Chains 65 Links. This Diftance be- 
ing taken from your Scale, and applied to your Table from L to C, will give you the Point 
C, reprefenting the third Mark. 

In this manner you mull: deal with the reft of the Marks at D, E, and F, and more, if the 
Field had confifted of more Sides and Angles. 

Laftly ; When you have made Obfervations of all the Marks round the Field, and found 
the Points ABCDE and F upon your Table, you muft draw Lines from one Point to 
another, 'till you conclude where you firft begun. As, draw a Line from A to B, from B to 
C, from C to D, from D to E, from E to F, and from F to A, where you begun •, then 
will A B C D E F, be the exact Figure of your Field, and the Line N S the Me- 
ridian. 

Note, Our Chains are commonly 4 Poles in Length, and are divided into one hundred 
equal Parts, called Links, at every tenth of which are Brafs Difti notions numbering them. 

USE III. To take the Plot of a Wood, Park, or other large Champ ain Plain t by the 
Plain-Table, in meafuring round about the fame. 

Suppofe ABCDEFGtobea large Wood, whofe Plot you defire to take upon the 
Plain-Table, 
pie,, , I. Having put a Sheet of Paper upon the Table, place your Inftrument at the Angle A, 

and direct your Sights to the next Angle at B, and by the Side thereof draw a Line upon 
your Table, as the Line A B. Then meafure by the Hedge -Side from the Angle A to the 
Angle B, which fuppofe 12 Chains 5 Links. Then trom your Scale take 12 Chains 5 Links, 
and lay off upon your Table from A to B. Then turn the Index about, and direct the Sights 
to G, and draw the Line A G upon the Table. But at prefent you need not meafure the 
Diftance. 

II. Remove your Inftrument from A, and fet up a Mark where it laft flood, and place 
your Inftrument at the fecond Angle B. Then laying the Index upon the Line A B, turn 
the whole Inftrument about, 'till thro* the Sights you fee the Mark fet up at A, and there 
icrew the Inftrument. Then laying the Index upon the Point B, direct your Sights to 
the Angle C, and draw the Line B C upon your Table. Then meafuring the Diftance 
B C 4 Chains 45 Links, take that Diftance from your Scale, and fet it upon your Table from 
B toC. 

III. Remove your Inftrument from B, and fet up a Mark in the room of it, and place your 
Inftrument at C, laying the Index upon the Line C B ; and turn the whole Inftrument about, 
'till thro' the Sights you efpy the Mark fet up at B, and there faften the Inftrument. Then 
laying the Index on the Point C, direct the Sights to D, and draw upon the Table the Line 
C D. Then meafure from C to D 8 Chains S5 Links, and fet that Diftance upon your Table 
from C to D. 

IV. Remove the Inftrument to D (placing a Mark at C, where it laft flood), and lay the 
Index upon the Line DC, turning the whole Inftrument about, 'till thro' the Sights you fee 
the Mark at C, and there faften the Inftrument. Then lay the Index on the Point D, and 
direct the Sights to E, and draw the Line D E. Then with your Chain meafure the Diftance 
DE 13 Chains 4 Links, which lay off on the Table from D to E. 

V. Remove your Inftrument to E (placing a Mark at D, where it laft flood), and laying 
the Index upon the Line D E, turn the whole Inftrument about, 'till thro' the Sights you fee 
the Mark at D, and there faften the Inftrument. Then lay the Index on the Point E, and 
direct the Sights to F, and draw the Line E F. Then meafure the Diftance E F 7 Chains 70 
Links, which take from your Scale, and lay off from E to F. 

VI. Remove your Inftrument to F, placing a Mark at E (where it laft flood), and lay the 
Index upon the Line E F, turning the Inftrument about, 'till you fee the Mark fet up at E, 
and there faften the Inftrument. Then laying the Index on the Point F, direct the Sights to 
G, and draw the Line F G upon the Table, which Line F G will cut the Line A G in 
the Point G. Then meafure the Diftance F G 5 Chains 6y Links, and lay it off from 
F to G. 

VII. Remove your Inftrument to G (fetting a Mark where it laft flood), and lay the Index 
upon the Line F G, turning the whole Inftrument about, 'till thro' the Sights you fee the 
Mark at F, and there faften the Inftrument. Then laying the Index upon the Point G, di- 
rect the Sights to A (your firft Mark), and draw the Line G A, which, if you have truly 
wrought, will pafs directly thro' the Point A, where you firft began. 

In this manner may you take the Plot of any Champain Plain, be it never fo large. And 
here note, That very often Hedges are of fuch a Thicknefs, that you cannot come near the 
Sides or Angles of the Field, either to place your Inftrument, or meafure the Lines. There- 
fore in fuch Cafes you muft place your Inftrument, and meafure your Lines parallel to the 
Side thereof ; and then your Work will be the fame as if you meafured the Hedge itfelf. 

* NOTE 



Chap. 2. of the Plain-Table, and Circumferentor. \\\ 

NO T E alfo, That in thus going about a Field, you may much help yourfelf by the 
Needle. For looking what Degree of the Card the Needle cuts at one Station, if you 
remove your Inflru merit to the next Station, and with your Sights look to the Mark where 
the Inftrument laft flood, you will find the Needle to cut the fame Degree again, which 
will give you no fmall Satisfaction in the profecution of your Work. And tho' there be a 
hundred or more Sides, the Needle will itill cut the fame Degree at all of them, except 
you have committed fome former Error : therefore at every Station have an Eye to the 
Needle. 

Of Shifting of Paper, 

In taking the Plot of a Field by the Plain-Table, and going about the fame, as before di- Fig. 4. 
reded, it may fo fall out, if the Field be very large, and when you are to take many Inclo- 
fures together, that the Sheet of Paper upon the Table will not hold all the Work. But you 
muft be forced to take off that Sheet, and put another clean Sheet in the room thereof: and, 
in Plotting of a Manor or Lordfhip, many Sheets may be thus changed, which we call 
Shifting of Paper. The Manner ot performing thereof is as follows. 

Suppofe in going about to take the Plot A B C D E F G, as before directed,, that you hav- 
ing made choice of the Angle at A for the Place of the Beginning, and vproceeded from 
thence to B, and ftom B to C, and from C to D, when you come to the Angle at D, and 
are to draw D E, you want room to draw the fame upon the Table. Do thus : 

Firft, thro' the Point D draw the Line D O, which is almoft fo much of the Line D E, 
as the Table will contain. Then near the Edge of the Table H M, draw a Line parallel to 
H M, by means of the Inches and Subdivifions on the oppofite Sides of the Frame, as P Q^, 
and another Line at Right Angles to that thro' the Point O, as O N. This being done, 
mark this Sheet of Paper with the Figure (1) about the Middle thereof, for the firft Sheet. 
Then taking this Sheet off your Table, put another clean Sheet thereon, and draw upon it Fl - _ 
a Line parallel to the contrary Edge of the Table, as the Line R S. Then taking your firft 
Sheet of Paper, lay it upon the Table fo, that the Line P Qjnay exactly lie upon the Line R S, 
to the b -ft advantage, as at the Point O {Fig. 5.). Then with the Point of your CompafTes 
draw fo much of the Line O D upon the clean Sheet of Paper as the Table will hold. Hav- 
ing thus done, proceed with your Work upon the new Sheet, beginning at the Point O ; 
and fo going forward with your Work, as in all Refpects has before been directed •, as from

In o-oing about a Field in this manner, you may perceive a wonderful quick Difpatch j 
for you are only to take notice of the Degrees cut once at every Angle, and not to ufe any 
Back-Sights, that is, to look thro' the Sights to the Station you laft went from. But to ufe 
Back-Sights with the Circumferentor, is beft to confirm your Work : For when you (land at 
any Angle of a Field, and direct your Sights to the next, and obferve what Degrees the 
South-End of the Needle cuts ; if you remove your Inftrument from this Angle to the next, 
and look to the Mark or Angle where it laft flood, the Needle will there alfo cut the fame 
Degrees as before. 

So the Inftrument being placed at A, if you direct the Sights to B, you will find the Needle 
to cut 19-1 Degrees •, then removing your Inftrument to B, if you direct the Sights to A, the 
Needle will then alfo cut 191 Degrees. 

Notwithstanding the quick Difpatch this Inftrument makes, one half of the Work will al- 
moft be faved ; if, inftead of placing the Inftrument at every Angle, you place it but at every 
other Angle. An Inftance of which take in the aforegoing Example. 

1. Placing the Inftrument at A, and directing the Sights to B, you find the Needle'to cut 
191 Degrees. Then, 

2. Placing the Inftrument at B, directing the Sights to C, you find the Needle to cut 279 
Degrees. And, 

3. Placing the Inftrument at C, and directing the Sights to D, you find the Needle to cut 
2 1 6 Degrees. 

Now, having placed your Inftrument at A, and noted down the Degrees cut by the 
Needle, which was 191, you need not go to the Angle B at all, but go next to the Angle 
C, and there place your Inftrument ; and directing your Sights backwards to B, you wifl 
find the Needle to cut 279 Degrees, which are the fame as were before cut when the Inftru- 
ment was placed at B : fo that the Labour of placing the Inftrument at B is wholly faved. 
Then (the Inftrument ftill (landing at C) direct the Sights to D, and the Needle will cut 
216 Degrees, as before, which note in your Field-Book. This done, remove your Inftru- 
ment to £, and obferve according to the laft Directions, and you will find the Work to be 
the fame as before. Then remove the Inftrument from E to G, from G to K, and fo to eyery 
fecond Angle. 
Hg, 7. I now proceed, to fhew the Manner of Protracting the former Obfervations. 

According to the largenefs of your Plot provide a Sheet of Paper, as L MN O, upon 
which draw the Line L M, and parallel thereto draw divers other Lines quite thro' the whole 
Paper, as the pricked Lines, in the Figure, drawn between L M and N O. Thefe Parallels 
thus drawn, reprefent Meridians. Upon one or other of thefe Lines, or parallel to one of 
them, muft the Diameter of your Protractor be always laid. 

r. Your Paper being thus prepared, afilgn any Point upon any of the Meridians, as A, 
upon which place the Center of the Protractor, laying the Diameter thereof upon the Me- 
ridian Line drawn upon the Paper. Then look in your Field-Book what Degrees the Needle 
cuts at A, which was 191 Degrees. Now, becaufe the Degrees were above 180, you muft 
therefore lay the Semi-Circle of the Protractor downwards, and keeping it there, make a Mark 
with the Protracting-Pin againft 191 Degrees \ thro' which Point, from A, draw the Line 
A B, containing 10 Chains 75 Links. 

2. Lay the Center of the Protractor on the Point B, with the Diameter in the fame Por- 
tion as before directed (which always obferve). And becaufe the Degrees cut at B were more 
than 180, viz. 279, therefore the Semi-Circle of the Protractor muft lie dov/nwards •, and fo 
holding it, make a Mark againft the 279 Degrees, and thro' it draw the Line B C, contain- 
ing 6 Chains 83 Links. 

3. Place the Center of the Protractor on the Point C. Then the Degrees cut by the 
Needle at the Obfervation in C, being above 180, namely, 216 Degrees 30 Minutes, the 
Semi-Circle of the Protractor muft lie downwards. Then making a Mark againft 216 Deg. 
30 Min. thro' it draw the Line C D, containing 7 Chains 82 Links. 

4. Lay the Center of the Protractor upon the Point'D-, the Degrees cut by the Needle at 
that Angle being 325 : which being above 180, lay the Semi-Circle downward ; and againft 
3,25 Degrees make a Mark, thro' which Point, and the Angle D, draw the Line D E, con- 
taining 6 Chains 96 Links,

5. Remove your Protractor to E. And bccaufe the Degrees cut by the Needle at this 
Angle were lefs than ioo, namely, 12 Degrees 30 Min. therefore lay the Semi-Circle of the 
Protractor upwards, and make a Mark, againft 12 Degrees 30 Minutes, thro' which draw the 
Line E F, containing 9 Chains 71 Links. 

6. Lay the Center of the Protractor upon the Point F ; and becaiife the Degrees to be pro- 
tracted are above iSo, viz. 342 Degrees 30 Minutes, lay the Semi-Circle of the Protractor 
downwards, and make a Mark againft: 342 Degrees 30 Minutes, drawing the Line F G, 
containing 7 Chains 54 Links. 

And in this Manner muft you -protract all the other Angles, G, H, and K, and more, if the 
Field had confided of more Angles.

Of the CohfiruEiton arid Ufe of the Surveying- Wheel. 

THIS Inftrument confifts of a wooden Wheel, fhod with Iron, to prevent it's wear- Fig ?, 
ing, exactly two Feet feven Inches and a half in Diameter, that fo it's Circumlerence 
may be eight Feet three Inches, or half a Pole. 

At the End of the Axle-Tree of this Wheel, on the left Side thereof, is, at Right Angles 
to the Axle-Tree, a little Star, about three fourths of an Inch Diameter, having eight Teeth. 
Now the Ufe of this Star is fuch, that when the Wheel moves round, the faid Star's Teeth, 
by falling at Right Angles into the Teeth of another Star of eight Teeth, fixed at one End 
of an Iron Rod (QJ caufes the Iron Rod to move once round in the fame Time the Wheel 
hath moved once round. Therefore every time you have drove the Wheel half a Pole, the 
Iron Rod goes once round. 

This Iron Rod, lying along a Groove in the Side of the Body of the Inftrument, hath 
on the other End a i qua re Hole, in which goes the fquare End b of the little Cylinder 
P. This Cylinder is faftened underneath the upper Plate H, of a Movement, covered 
with a Glafs, placed in the Body of the Inftrument at B, yet fo, that it may be move- Fi'g. 0. 
able about it's Axis, having the End a cut into a fingle threaded perpetual Screw, which 
falling into the Teeth of the Wheel A, being thirty-two in Number, when you drive the 
Inftrument forwards, caufes the Wheel A to go once round at the End of each 16th 
Pole. The Pinion B hath fix Teeth, which falling into the Teeth of the Wheel C, 
whofe Number is fixty, caufes that to move once round at the End of each 1 60th Pole, 
or half Mile. This Wheel carries round a Hand, once in 160 Poles, over the Divifions 
of an annular Plate, fixed upon the Plate H, whofe outmoft Limb is divided into 160 
equal Parts, each tenth of which is numbered, and fhews how many Poles the Inftrument 
is drove. 

Again •, The Pinion D, which is fixed to the fame Arbre as the Wheel C is, hath twenty 
Teeth, which by their falling into the Teeth of the Wheel E, which hath forty Teeth, 
caufes the faid Wheel E to go round once in 320 Poles, or one Mile-, and the Pinion F, of 
twelve Teeth, falling into the Teeth of the Wheel G, whofe Number is 72, caufes the 1 
Wheel G to go once round in 12 Miles. This Wheel G carries another leifer Hand once 
round in 12 Miles, over the Divifions of the innermoft Limb of the aforefaid annular Plate, 
which is divided into twelve equal Parts for Miles, and each Mile fubdivided into Halves 
and Quarters (that is, into eight equal P«arts, for Furlongs), with Roman Characters num- 
bering the Miles. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument is fuch, that by driving the Wheel before you, the Number 
of Miles, Poles, or both, you have gone, is eafily fhewn by the two Elands. And fo this 
Inftrument, together with a Theodolite or Circumferentor, for taking of Bearings, is of ex- 
cellent Ufe in Plotting of Roads, Rivers, &amp;c. For having placed your Wheel and Circum- 
ferentor at the Beginning of the Road you defign to plot, which call your firft Station, caufe 
fome Perfon to go as far along the Road as you find it ftraight •, and then take a Bearing to 
him, which fet down. This being done, drive the Wheel before you to the Place where the 
Man (lands, which call the fecond Station, and note, by the Hands of the Dial-Plate, the 
Diftance from the firft Station to the fecond, which fet down. Again, Having placed your 
Circumferentor at the fecond Station, caufe the Man to go along the Road 'till he comes to 
another Bend therein. And from the fecond Station take a Bearing to the Man at the third, 
which fet down. Then drive the Wheel from the fecond Station to the third, and note the 
Diftance, which fet down. And in this Manner proceed 'till you come to your Journey's 
End. Then in Plotting the Road, you muft obferve the fame Directions, as are given in 
Plotting the Example of Ufe IV. of the la't Chapter.

ConflruSiion of a Water-LeveL 

HE nrfl of thefe Inflruments is a Water-Level, compofcd of a round 
Tube of Brafs, or other folid Matter, about 3 Feet long, and 12 or 15 
Lines Diameter, whofe Ends are turned up at Right Angles, for receiving 
two Glafs Tubes, 3 or 4 Inches long, fattened on them with Wax 0? Ma- 
flick. At the Middle and underneath this Tube, is fixed a Ferrel, for 
placing it upon it's Foot. 

There is as much common or coloured Water poured into one End of 
it, as that it may appear in the Glafs Tubes. 
This Level, altho' very fimple, is very commodious for levelling fmall Diftances. 
It is founded upon this, that Water always naturally places itfelf level ; and therefore the 
Height of the Water in the two Glafs Tubes will be always the fame, in refpect to the Center 
of the Earth. 

The Air-Level B, is a very flraight Glafs Tube, every where of the fame Thicknefs, of an 
indetermined Length, and Thicknefs in proportion ; being filled to a drop with Spirit of 
Wine, or other Liquor, not fubject to freeze. The Ends of the Tube are hermetically 
fealed, that is, the End through which the Spirit of Wine is poured mufl afterwards be clofed,. 
by heating it with the Flame of a Lamp, blown thro' a little Brafs Tube, to make the heat 
the greater ; and then when the Glafs is become foft, the End muft be clofed up. 

When this Inflrument is perfectly level, the Bubble of Air will fix itfelf juft in the Mid- 
dle, and when it is not level, the Bubble of Air will rife to the top. 

Conjtruifien of an Air -Lev eh 

This Inflrument is cornpofed of an Air-Level 1, about 8 Inches long, and 7 or 8 Lines 
in Diameter, fet in a Brafs Tube 2 ; which is left open in the Middle for feeing the Bubble of 
Air at the Top. 

It is carried upon a very flrong flraight Rule, about a Foot long, at the Ends of which arc 
placed two Sights exaclly of the fame Height, and like that of Number 3, which has a fquare 
Hole therein, having two Fillets of Brafs very finely filed, eroding one another at Right 
Angles, in the Middle of which Fillets is drilled a little Hole. There is fattened a little thin 
fciece of Brafs to this Sight, 'with a fmall Headed-Rivet, to flop the faid Square opening,

when there is occafion,- and having a little Hole drilled thro' it, anfwering to that which is 
in the Middle of the Fillets. The Brafs Tube is fattened upon the Rule, by means of two 
Screws, one of which marked 4, ferves to raife or deprefs the Tube at pleafure, for placing 
it level, and making it agree with the Sights. 

The Top of the Ball and Socket is riveted to a little Rule, that fprings, one of whofe Ends 
is fattened with two Screws to the great Rule, and at the other End there is a Screw 5, fervinf 
to raife or deprefs the whole Inftrument when it is nearly level. 

The Manner of adjutting this Level is eafy, for you need but place it upon it's Foot, fo 
that the Bubble of Air may be exactly in the Middle of the Tube ; then fhutting the Sight 
next to the Eye, and opening the other, the Point of the Object which is cut by the hori- 
zontal Fillet is level with the Eye •, and to know whether the Air-Level agrees well with 
the Sights, you mutt turn the Inftrument quite about, and fhut the Sight which before was 
opened, and open the other. Then looking through the little Hole, if the fame Point of the 
Object before obferved be cut by the horizontal Fillet, it is a fign the Level is juft •, but if 
there be found any difference, the Tube mutt be raifed or deprefled by means of the Screw 4, 
'till the Sights agree with the Level ; that is, that looking at an Object, the Bubble of Air 
being in the Middle, and afterwards turning the Inftrument about, the fame Object may be 
ieen. 

The Level D is a little Glafs Tube inclofed within a Brafs Tube, fattened upon a Rule per- Fig. D, 
fectly equal in Thicknefs, and ferves to know whether a Plane be level, or not. 

Conflruclion of a Tele/cope Air- Level. 

This Level is like the Level C, but inftead of Sights, it carries a Telefcope to difcover Fig E. 
Objects at a good Diftance. This Telefcope is in a little Brafs Tube, about 15 Inches long, 
fattened upon the fame Rule as the Level, which ought to be of a good Thicknefs, and very 
ftraight. 

At the End of the Tube of the Telefcope, marked 1, enters the little Tube 1, carrying 
the Eye-Glafs, and a human Hair horizontally placed in the Focus of the Object-Glafs 2. 
This little Tube may be drawn out or puttied into the great one, for adjutting the Telefcope 
to different Sights. 

At the other End of the Telefcope is placed the Object-Glafs, whofe Construction is the 
fame as that before-mentioned, belonging to the Semi-Circle. 

The whole Body of the Telefcope is fattened to the Rule, as well as the Level, with 
Screws, upon two little fquare Plates, foldered towards the Ends of each Tube, which ought 
to be perfectly equal in Thicknefs. 

The Screw 3, is for raifing or lowering, the little Fork carrying the human Hair, and 
making it agree with the Bubble of Air, when the Inftrument is level ; and the Screw 4, is 
for making the Bubble of Air agree with the Telefcope. 

Underneath the Rule there is a Brafs Plate with Springs, having a Ball and Socket fattened 
thereto. 

The Level F, is in form of a Square, having it's two Branches of equal length ; at the Fig. F, 
Junction of which there is made a little Hole, from which hangs a Thread and Plummet, 
playing upon a Perpendicular Line, in the Middle of the Quadrant, often divided into 90 
Degrees. It's Ufe is very eafy, for the Ends of the Branches being placed upon a Plane, 
we may know that the Plane is level when the Thread plays upon the Perpendicular in the 
Middle of the Quadrant. 

Conflruclion of a 'Telefcope Plumb-Level. 

This Inftrument is compofed of two Branches, joined together at Right Angles ; whereof Fig. G, 
that carrying the Thread and Plummet, is about a Foot and a half, or two Foot long. 

This Thread is hung towards the Top of the Branch, at the Point 2. The Middle of the 
Branch, where the Thread paries, is hollow, that fo it may not touch in any Place but to- 
wards the Bottom, at the Place 3, where there is a little Blade of Silver, on which is drawn a 
Line perpendicular to the Telefcope. 

The faid Cavity is covered by two Pieces of Brafs, making as it were a kind of Cafe, 
left the Wind fhould agitate the Thread ; for which reafon there is alfo a Glafs covering the 
Silver Blade, to the End that we may fee when the Thread and Plummet play upon the Per- 
pendicular. The Telefcope 1, is fattened to the other Branch, which is about two Feet 
long, and is made like the other Telefcopes of which we have already fpoken. All the 
Fxactnefs of this Inftrument confifts in having the Telefcope at Right Angles with the 
Perpendicular. 

This Inftrument has a Ball and Socket faftened behind the aforefaid Eranch, for placing it 
upon it's Foot. 

There are fome of thefe fort of Levels made of Brafs or iron, whofe Telefcope and the 
Cavity, in which is included the Thread carrying the Plummet, is about 4 or 5 Feet long, 
in order to level great Diftances at once. 

The Telefcope is about 1 Inch and a half Diameter, and theCafe in which theThread, carrying 
the Plummet, is inclofed, is about 2 Inches wide, and half an Inch thick. This Cafe is fattened 

with 



T -6 ^he ConjlruEiion and Ufes Book V* 

with Screws in the Middle, to the Telefcope ; fo that they may be at Right Angles with one 
another: And at the two Ends of the Telefcope are adjufted two broad Circles, in which 
the Telefcope exactly turns ; which Circles, being flat underneath, are faftened to a ftrong 
Iron Rule. 

This Level is fupported by two Feet almoft like that of Figure E, Plate 12, faftened 
with Screws to the Extremities of the Iron Rule. Alfo there are two Openings, covered with 
Glaffes, inclofed in little Brafs Frames, which open, that fo the Thread and Plummet may 
be hung to the Top of the Cafe, and play upon two little Silver Blades, in a Line drawn on 
them perpendicular to the Telefcope. Thefe Blades are placed againft the Openings of the 
Cafe* and the Telefcope is like that before fpoken of, on the Semi-Circle. 

All the Exactnefs of this Inftrument confifts in having the Telefcope at Right Angles to the 
Perpendiculars drawn upon the Silver Blades. 

To prove this Level, you muft place it upon it's Foot, in fuch manner that the Thread 
may exactly play upon the Perpendicular, and note fome Object cut by the Hair in the Focus 
of the Telefcope. Then taking off the Thread and Plummet, turn the Inftrument upfide 
down, and hanging the Thread and Plummet to the Hook at the Bottom of the Cafe, which 
will now be uppermoft, look thro' the Telefcope at the aforefaid Object, and if the Thread 
exactly plays upon the Perpendicular, it is a fign the Inftrument is exact ; but if it does not, 
you mult remove the little Hook to the Right-hand or Left, 'till you make the Thread fall 
upon the Perpendicular, both before you have turned the Inftrument upfide down, and after- 
wards. You may likewife raife or lower the Telefcope, by means of a Screw. Note, Inge- 
nious Workmen may eafily fupply what I have omitted in this brief Defcription. 
Fig. H, The Inftrument H is a little fimple Level, founded on the fame Principle as the three pre- 

cedent ones •, the Figure thereof is fufficient to fhew it's Conftruction and Ufe. 
Fig. I. The Level I. places itfelf, and is compofed of a pretty thick Brafs Rule, about one Foot 

long, and an Inch broad, having two Sights of the fame Height placed at the Ends of the 
Rule, and in the Middle there is a kind of Beam (almoft like thofe of common Scales) for 
freely fufpending the Level. 

At the Bottom of the faid Rule is fcrewed on a Piece of Brafs, likewife carrying a pretty 
heavy Ball of Brafs. All the Exactnefs of this Inftrument confifts in a perfect Equilibrium ; 
to know which, it is eafy : for holding the Inftrument fufpended by it's Ring, and having 
efpied fome Object thro' the Sights, you need but turn the Inftrument about, and obferve 
whether the aforefaid Object appears of the fame Height thro' the Sights •, and if it does, 
the Inftrument is perfectly in equilibria : but if the Object appears a little higher or lower, 
you may remedy it by removing the Piece of Brafs carrying the Ball 'till it be exactly in the 
Middle of the Point of Sufpenfion, and then it muft be fixed with a Screw, becaufe, by Ex- 
perience, the Inftrument was found to be level. 

Conjlrufiion of a Level of Mr Huygens'/. 

Fig. K. The principal Part of this Inftrument, is a Telefcope a, 15 or 18 Inches long, being in 

Form ot a Cylinder, and going thro' a Ferrel, in which it is faftened by the Middle. This 
Ferrel has two flat Branches b b, one above, and the other below, each about a fourth Part of 
the Telefcope in length. At the Ends of each of thefe two Branches are faftened little moving 
Pieces, which carry two Rings, by one of which the Telefcope is fufpended to a Hook, at the 
End of the Screw 3 •, and by the other a pretty heavy Weight is fufpended, in order to keep 
the Telefcope in equilibrio. This Weight hangs in the Box 5, which is almoft filled with 
Linfeed Oil, Oil of Wallnuts, or any thing elle that will not coagulate, for more aptly fet- 
tling the Ballances of the Weight and Telefcope. 

This Inftrument carries fometimes two Telefcopes clofe, and very parallel to each other, 
the Eye-Glafs of one being on one fide, and the Eye-Glafs of the other on the oppofite fide, 
that fo one may fee on both fides, without turning the Level. If the Tube of the Telefcope 
being fufpended, be not found level, as it will often happen, put a Ferrel or Ring 4 upon it, 
which may be flid along the Tube, for placing it level, and keeping it fo. And this muft 
be, it there be two Telefcopes. 

There is a human Hair horizontally (trained and faftened to a little Fork in the Focus of 
the Object Glafs of each Telefcope, which may be raifed or lowered, by means of a little 
Screw, as has been already mentioned. 

For proving this Level, having fufpended it by one of the Branches, obferve fome diftant 
Object through the Telefcope, with the Weight not hung on, and very exactly mark the 
Point of the Object cut by the Hair of the Telefcope : Now hanging the Weight on, if 
the horizontal Hair anfwers to the fame Point of the faid Object, it is a fign the Center of 
Gravity of the Telefcope and Weight, is precifely in a Right Line joining the two Points of 
Sufpenfion, which continued would pafs thro' the Center of the Earth. 

But if it otherwife happens, you muft remedy it, by Aiding the little Ring backwards or 
forwards. Having thus adjufted the Telefcope, that the fame Point of an Object be feen, 
as well before the Weight is hung on, as afterwards, you muft turn it upfide down, by fuf- 
pending it to the Branch that was lowermoft, and hanging the Weight upon the other. Then 
if the Hair in the Telefcope cuts the aforefaid Point of the Object, it is .rnanifeft, that that 

Point 



Chap. 2. of Inftrument s for Levelling. 137 

Point of the Object is in the horizontal Plane, with the Center of the Tube of the Telefcope: 
but if the Hair does not cut that Point of the Object, it mud be raifed or lowered by means 
of the Screw 'till it does. Note, You muft every now and then prove this Inftrument, for 
fear lead fome Alteration has happened thereto. 

The Hook on which this Inftrument is hung, is fixed to a flat wooden Crofs, at the Ends 
of each Arm of which, there is a Hook ferving to keep the Telefcope from too much Agita- 
tion, when the Inftrument is ufing, and for keeping it fteady when it is carrying, in lower- 
ing the Telefcope by means of the Screw 3, which carries it. 

There is applied to the faid flat Crofs, another hollowed Crofs faftened with Hooks, Which 
ferves as a Cafe for the Inftrument. But note, The two Ends of the Crofs are left open, that 
fo the Telefcope being covered from Wind and Rain, may be always in a Condition to ufe. 

The Foot fupporting the Inftrument, is a round Brafs Plate fomething concave, to which 
is faftened three Brafs Ferrels, moveable by means of Joints, wherein are Staves of a conve- 
nient Length put. The Box at the Bottom of the Level is placed upon this Plate, and may 
be any ways turned •, fo that the Weight, which ought to be Brafs, may have a free Motion 
in the Box, which muft be (hut by means of a Screw, that fo the Oil may be preferved in

This Inftrument is a Level almoft like that whofe Defcription we have laft given, but it is Fig. L. 
eafier to carry from place to place. 

Number 1. Is the Cafe in which the Telefcope is enclofed. 

2. Is a kind of Stirrup, where the Screw, ferving for the Point of Sufpenfion, paflcs ; at 
the End of which is a Hook, upon which the Ring, at the End of the Plate carrying the 
Telefcope, is hung. 

3. Are the Screws above and below for fixing the Telefcope, when the Inftrument is carry- 
ing. 

4. Are the Hooks for keeping the Cafe (hut. 

5. Is one End of the Telefcope. 

6. Is the End of the Plate whereon a great Brafs Ball 7 is hung, ferving to keep the Tele- 
fcope level. 

There are three Ferrels 8, well fixed to the Bottom of the Stirrup, ferving as a Foot to 
fupport the whole Inftrument. Note, There are fometimes put two Telefcopes on this Level, 
as well as in that other of which we have laft fpoken. 

CHAP. II. 

Of the Ufes of the aforefaid Inflruments in Levelling, 

T Evelling is an Operation (hewing the Height of one Place in refpect to another. One 
\j Place is faid to be higher than another, when it is more diftant from the Center of the 
Earth. A Line equally diftant from the Center of the Earth, in all it's Points, is called the 
Line of true Level ; whence, becaufe the Earth is round, that Line muft be a Curve, and 
make a part of the Earth's Circumference, as the Line B C F G, all the Points of which are Fig. u 
equally diftant from the Center A of the Earth: but the Line of Sight, which the Operations 
of Levels give, is a right Line perpendicular to the Semi-Diameter of the Earth A B, raifed 
above the true Level, denoted by the Curvature of the Earth, in proportion as it is more ex- 
tended •, for which Reafon, the Operations which we (hall give, are but of the apparent 
Level, which muft be corrected to have the true Level, when the Line of Sight exceeds 50 
Toifes. 

The following Table, in which are denoted the Corrections of the Points of apparent 
Level, for reducing them to the true Level, was calculated by help of the Semi-Diameter of 
the Earth, whofe Length may be known by meafuring one Degree of it's Circumference. The 
Gentlemen of the Academy of Sciences, have found by very exact Obfervations, that one De- 
gree of the Circumference of a great Circle of the Earth, as the Meridian, contains 57292 
Toifes ; and giving 25 Leagues to a Degree, a League will be 2291 \-\ Toifes. 

Now the whole Circumference of the Earth will be 9000 of the lame Leagues, and it's Di- 
ameter 2863 T 7 r of them ; from whence all Places on the Superficies of the Earth, will be di- 
ftant from it's Center 142 1 i* Leagues. 

The Line A B reprefents the Semi-Diameter of the Earth, under the Feet or the (Jt&gt;- 
ferver. The right Line B D E, reprefents the vifual Ray, whofe Points D and E are in the 
apparent Level of the Point B. This Line of apparent Level, ferves for determining a Line 
of true Level, which is done by taking from the Points of the Line of apparent LevJ, the 
Height they are above the true Level in refpect to a certain Point, as B ; for it plainly appears 
from the Figure, that all the Points D, E, of the apparent Level, are farther diftant from the

Center of the Earth, than the Point B ; and to find the Difference, you need but confider 
the right-angled Triangle A B D, whofe two Sides AB, B D, being known, the Hypothe- 
nufe A D, may be found : from which fubftracting the Radius A C, the Remainder C D will 
fhew the Height of the Point D of apparent Level, above the Point of true Level.

'The Rule ferving to calculate this 
Table, is to divide the Square of the 
Diftance by the Diameter of the Earth, 
which is 6,565,179 Toifes ; for which 
Reafon the Corrections are to one an- 
other, as the Squares of the Difiances. 
Altho' the Foundation of this Calculation 
be not fir icily Geometrical, yet it is nigh 
enough the Truth for PracJice. 



If the Points of apparent Level mould be taken inflead of the Points of true Level, a Body 
would err in conducting the Water of a Source, which let be, for Example, at the Point B ; 
for this Source will not run along the Line B D E, but will remain in the Point B ; for if 
it mould run along the Line B E, it would run higher than it is, which is impoflible, be- 
caufe it cannot be endued with any other Figure but a Circular one, equally diftant from the 
Center of the Earth. On the contrary, a Source in D will have a great Defcent down to 
the Point B ; but it cannot run further, becaufe it muft be elevated higher than the Source, 
if it continues it's way in the fame right Line, which cannot be done, unlefs it be forced by 
fome Machine. 

How to reclify Levels. 

Fig. 2. To rectify Levels, as, for Example, The Air-Level C you muft plant two Staffs, as A B, 

about 50 Toifes diflant from each other, becaufe of the Roundnefs of the Earth (take care 
of exceeding that Diftance)-, then efpying from the Station A, the Point B, the Level being 
placed horizontally, and the Bubble of Air being in the Middle of the Tube, you muft raife 
or lower a Piece of Pafteboard upon the Staff B, in the Middle of which is drawn a black ho- 
rizontal Line, 'till the vifual Ray of the Obferver's Eye meets the faid Line •, after which muft 
be faftened another Piece of Pafteboard to the Staff A, the Middle of which let be the Height 
of the Eye, when the Piece of Pafteboard B was feen : then removing the Level to the Staff 
B, place it to the Height of the Center of the Pafteboard, and the Level being horizontally 
pofited for observing the Piece of Pafteboard A, if then the vifual Ray cuts the Middle of 
the Piece of Pafteboard, it is a fign the Level is very juft ; but if the vifual Ray falls above or 
below, as in the Point C, 'you muft, by always keeping the Eye at the fame Height, lower 
the Telefcope or the Sight, 'till the Middle of the vifual Ray falls upon the Middle of the 
Difference, as in D ; and the Telefcope thus remaining, the Tube of the Level muft be ad- 
jufted 'till the Bubble of Air fixes in the Middle, which may be done by means of the Screw 4. 

Again •, Return to the Staff A, and place the Level the Height of the Point D, for looking 
at the Piece of Pafteboard B ; and if the vifual Ray falls upon the Middle of the Piece of 
Pafteboard, it is a fign the Telefcope agrees with the Level : if not, the fame Operations muft 
be repeated, until the vifual Rays fall upon the Centers of the two Pieces of Pafteboard. 

Another way to reclify Levels. 

Knowing two Points diftant from each other, and perfectly level, place the End of the 
Telefcope carrying the Eye-Glafs to the exact Height of one of thofe two Points, the Bub- 
ble of Air being fixed in the Middle of it's Tube •, then by looking thro' it, if it happens that 

the 



Chap. 2. of Injlruments for Levelling, j *g 

the Hair of the Telefcope cuts the fccond Point, it is a fign the Level is juft ; but if the Hair 
falls above or below the Point of Level, you muft, in always keeping the Eye at the fame 
Height, raife or lower the End of the Level where the Object Glafs is, until the Vifual Ray 
of the Telefcope falls upon the exact Point of Level ; and leaving it thus, raife or deprefs the 
Tube carrying the Level, fo that the Bubble of Air may remain in the Middle. 

What we have faid concerning the Rectification of this Level, may ferve likewife for the 
Rectification of others, the Difference is only to change the Plummets and the Hairs of the 
Telefcopes, according to their Conftructions. 

The Manner of Levelling. 

To find, for Example, the Height of the Point A on the Top of a Mountain, above the Fig. %. 
Point B at it's foot, place the Level about the middle Diftance between the two Points, as in 
D, and plant Staffs in A and B. Alfo let there be Perfons inftructed with Signals, for raifino- 
or lowering upon the faid Staffs flit Sticks, at the Ends of which are fattened pieces of 
Pafte-Board : The Level being placed upon it's Foot, look towards the Staff A E, and caufe 
one of the Pcfons to raife or lower the Pafte-Board, until the upper Edge or Middle appears 
in the vifual Ray •, then meafure exactly the perpendicular Height of the Point E above 
the Point A, which, in this Example, fuppofe 6 Feet 4 Inches, which fet down in a Memo- 
rial. Then turn the Level horizontally, fo that it may always be at the fame Height, for 
the Eye-Glafs of the Telefcope to be next to the Eye •, but if it be a Sight Level, there is 
no ncceffity of turning it about, and caufe the Perfbn at the Staff "B to raife or lower the 
Piece of Pafte-Board, until the upper Edge of it be feen, as at C, which fuppofe 16 Feet 
6 Inches, which fet down in the Memorial above the other Number of the firft Station •, 
whence to know the Height of the Point A above the Point B, take 6 Feet 4 Inches from 16 
Feet 2 Inches, and the Remainder will be 10 Feet 2 Inches, for the Heighth of A 
above B. 

Note, If the Point D, where the Obferver is placed, be in the Middle between the Point 
A and the Point B, there is no neceffity of regarding the Height of the apparent Level 
above the true Level, becaufe thofe two Points being equally diftant from the Eye of the Ob- 
ferver, the vifual Ray will be equally raifed above the true Level, and confequently there 
needs no Correction to give the Height of the Point A above the Point B. 

Another Example of Levelling. 

It is required to Know, whether there be a fufficient Defcent for conducting Water from Fig. 4. 
the Source A to the Receptacle B of a Spring. Now becaufe the Biftance from the Point 
A to B is great, there are feveral Operaiions required to be made. Having chofen a proper 
Height for placing the Level, as at the Point I, plant a Pole in the Point A near the Source, 
on which Aide up and down another, carrying the Piece of Pafte-Board L •, meafure the Di- 
ftance from A to I, which fuppofe 1000 Toifes. Then the Level being adjufted in the 
Point K, let fomebody move the Pafte-Board L up or down, until you can efpy it thro' the 
Telefcope or Sigfus of the Level, and meafure the Height A L, which fuppofe 2 Toifes, 
1 Foot, 5 Inches. But becaufe the Diftance A I is 1000 Toifes, according to the afore- 
mentioned Table, you muft fubftract 1 1 Inches, and the Fleight A L will confequently be 
but 2 Toifes 6 Inches, which note down in the Memorial. 

Now turn the Level about, fo that the Object Glafs of the Telefcope may be next to the 
Pole planted in the Point H, and the Level being adjufted, caufe fome Perfon to move the 
Piece of Pafte-Board G up and down, until the upper Edge of it may be efpied thro' the 
Telefcope -, meafure the Height H G, which fuppofe 3 Toifes, 4 Feet, 2 Inches ; meafure 
likewife the Diftance of the Points I, H, which fuppofe 650 Toifes ; tor which Diftance, 
according to the Table, you muft fubftract 4 Inches 8 Lines from the Fleight H G, which 
confequently will then be but 3 Toifes, 3 Feet, 9 Inches, 4 Lines, which fet down in the 
Memorial. 

This being done, remove the Level to fome other Eminence, from whence the Pole H G 
may be difcovered, and the Angle of the Houfe D, the Ground about which is level with 
the Receptacle B of the Spring. 

The Level being adjufted in the Point E, look at the Staff FI, and the vifual Ray will 
give the Point F •, meafure the Height H F, which fuppofe 11 Feet 6 Inches •, likewile mea- 
fure the Diftance IT E, which fuppofe 500 Toifes, for which Diftance the Table gives 2 In- 
ches 9 Lines of abatement, which being taken from the Fleight H F, and there will remain 
11 Feet, 3 Inches, 3 Lines, which fet down in the Memorial. Laftly, Flaving turned the 
Level for looking at the Angle of the Houfe D, meafure the Fleight of the Point D, where 
tne vifual Ray terminates above the Ground, which fuppofe S Feet 3 Inches. Meafure alio 
the Diftance from the Point D, to the faid Houfe, winch is 450 Toifes, for which Diftance 
the Table gives 2 Inches 3 Lines 01 Abatement •, which being taken from the faid Height, 
there will remain 8 Feet 9 Lines, which let down in the Memorial.

Of the Co7tflruEllon and Ufe of a Gauge for Meafuring Water. 

Fig. M. ^TH HIS Gauge ferves to know the Quantity of Water which a Source or Spring furnifhes, 

X and is commonly a Rectangular Parallelepipedon of Brafs well foldered, about a Foot 
long, 8 Inches broad, and as many in height, more or lefs, according to the Quantity of 
Water to be meafured, having feveral round Holes very exactly drilled in it, an Inch in Di- 
ameter, and others for Half an Inch of Water to pafs thro' ; and alfo others for a Quarter of 
an Inch of Water to pafs thro' them. All of which ought to be drilled fo as their Centers 
may be at the fame Height. The upper Extremes of the Inch-Holes muft be within two 
Lines of the Top of the Gauge •, and the Holes are flopped with little fquare Brafs Plates, ad- 
jufted in the Grooves 1, 2 and 3. There is a Brafs Partition, crofting the Veflel at the Place 4, 
fixed about an Inch from the Bottom, and drilled with feveral Holes, for the Water to pafs 
more freely. This Partition is made to receive the Shock of the Water falling from the Source 
into the Gauge, and hindring it from making Waves, fo that it may more naturally run 
out thro' the Holes. 

Note, The Holes which give a Cylindric Inch of Water, ought to be exactly 1 2 Lines in 
Diameter ; that giving half an Inch ought to be 8 j Lines, and that giving a Quarter of an 
Inch muft be exactly 6 Lines. This may be eafily found by Calculation. 

To ufe this Inftrument, it muft be placed fo as it's Bottom may be parallel to the Horizon, 
and then let the Water of the Source run thro' a Pipe into the Gauge (as per Figure), and 
when it wants about a Line of the Top, open one of the Holes (for Example) of an Inch. 
Then if the Water always keeps the fame Height in the Gauge, it is manifeft that there 
runs as much into it as goes out of it, and fo the Source will furnifh an Inch of Water. 

But 



Chap. 3. of a Gauge for Meafuring Water. 141 

But if the Water in the Gauge riles, there muft be another Hole opened, either of an Inch, 
half an Inch, or a Quarter of an Inch -, lb that the Water may keep to the fame Height in the 
Gau"-e, that is, to a Line above the Holes of an Inch ; and then the Number of Holes opened 
will give the Quantity of Water furnifhed by the Source. 

The little Velfel receiving the Water running out of the Gauge, is to fhew how much Fig. N. 
Water the Source fyrnifhes in a determinate Space of Time : For having a Pendulum which 
Twines Seconds, note how many Seconds there will be in the Time that this VefTel, fet un- 
der the Hole giving an Inch of Water, is filling ; and exactly meafuring the Quantity of 
Water it contains, you may have the Quantity of Water the Source furnifhes in an 
Hour. 

There has feveral very exact Experiments been made upon this Subject : from whence 
it has been found, that a Source giving one Inch of Water, will fill 14 Pints of Paris, in a 
Minute. 

it follows from hence, that an Inch of Water gives in an Hour 8 Paris Muids, and in 24 
Hours, 72 Muids. 

If, for Example, a Cubic Veffel be placed under the Gauge, containing a Cubic Foot •, and 
if the Water runs thro' the Hole giving an Inch of Water, that Veffel will be filled in two 
Minutes and a half: From whence it follows, that it gives 14 Pints in a Minute, becaufe it 
furnifhed 35 Pints in two Minutes and a half. 

By this means we may know the Inches of Water a Spring or Running-Stream gives : 
As if, for Example, the Spring gives 7 Pints of Water in a Second ; then it is faid to 
furnifh an Inch of Water: If it mould give 21 Pints, then it is faid to furnifh 3 Inches of 
Water •, and fo of others. 

To meafure the Running-Water of an Aqueduct or River, which cannot be received in a 
Gauge, you muft put a Ball of Wax upon the Water, made fo heavy with fome other Matter, 
as that there nay be but a fmall part of the Ball above the Surface of the Water, that fo the 
Wind can have no power on it. And after having meafured a Length of 15 or 20 Feet of 
the Aqueduct, you may know by a Pendulum in what time the Ball of Wax will be carried 
that Diftance ; and afterwards multiplying the Breadth of the Aqueduct or River by the 
Height of the Water, and that Product by the Space which the Ball of Wax has moved, 
this laft Product will give all the Water paffed, in the noted Time, thro' the Section of the 
River. Example ; Suppofe in an Aqueduct two Feet wide, and one Foot deepi a Ball of 
Wax moves, in 20 Seconds, 30 Feet, which will be one Foot and a half in a Second : But 
becaufe the Water moves fwifter at the Top than the Bottom, you muft take but 20 Feet, 
which will be one Foot in a Second •, the Product of one Foot deep, by 2 Feet broad, is 2 
Feet, which multiplied by 20, the Length, gives 40 Cubic Feet, or 40 times 35 Pints of 
Water, which makes 1400 Pints in 20 Seconds ; and if 20 Seconds give 1400 Pints, 60 
Seconds will give 4200 Pints-, and dividing 4200 by 14, which is the Number of Pints an 
Inch of Water gives, in a Minute or 60 Seconds, the Quotient 300 will be the Number of 
Inches which the Water of the Aqueduct furnifhes. 

Mr Mariotte, who has learnedly wrote about the Motion of Water, is of opinion that 
Springs are nothing but Rain Water, which paffing thro' the Earth, meets with Haffock 
or Clay, which it cannot penetrate •, and therefore is obliged to run along the Sides, and 
fo form a Spring. For fupporting this Hypothefis, he brings the following Experi- 
ment. 

Having fet a Cubic Veffel about a Foot high in a proper place to catch Rain- Water for 
ftveral Years, he obferved that the Water arofe in the Veffel each Year, one with another, 
1 8 Inches •, but he thought it better to make it but 1 5 Inches : whence a Toife will receive 
in a Year 45 Cubic Feet of Water; for multiplying 36 Feet by 15 Inches, the Product will 
be 45 Cubic Feet. 

The fame Author likewife computes the Extent of Ground which fupplies the River Seine 
with Water ; and has found that the Seine is not the fixth Part as big as it might be. He has 
again obferved, that it has but 10 Inches of Defcent in ioooToifes over-againft the Inva- 
lids. He faith likewife, that, according to this fuppofition, the greateft Spring of Montmartre y 
when it is moft abounding, doth not furnifh over and above Water, fince the Ground over- 
whelming it ought to fend Water thereto. Whence he concludes, that there is a great deal 
of Water loft in the Earth. 

To know the Shock Water produces, Experience has fhewn that Water accelerates it's 
Motion, according to the odd Numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, i£c. that is, if in a fourth Part of a Second 
it defcends one Foot in a Pipe, it will defcend 3 Feet in the next fourth of a Second. 

The Quantities of Water fpouting out thro' equal Holes made at the Bottoms of Referva- 
tories, of different Heights, are to each other in the fubduplicate Ratio of the Heights. The 
following Table fhews the different Expences of Water at different Heights.

You may fee by this Table, that an Ajutage *, double another in Diameter, will expend 
four times the Water as that other will. Example ; That of three Lines will expend in a 
Minute 14 Pints, and that of 6 Lines will expend §6 Pints. Note, The Ajutages mull not 
be made Conical, but Cylindrical. 

* Adjutage is a fmall Pipe thro 1 which the Water runs out. 



CHAP. IV. 

Of the Conjlruftion cmd Ufes of Infruments for Gunnery* 

Confiruclion of the Callipers. 
Fig. O. f I A HIS Inflrument is made of two Branches of Brafs, about fix or 7 Inches long when 

X. mut, each Branch being four Lines broad, and three in Thicknefs. The Motion of 
the Head thereof is like that of the Head of a two-Foot Rule, and the Ends of the Branches 
are bent inwards, and furnifhed with Steel at the Extremes. 

There is a Kind of Tongue faftened to one of the Branches, whofe Motion is like that 
of the Head, for raifing or lowering it, that fo it's End, which ought to be very thin, may 
be put into Notches made in the other Branch, on the Infide of which are marked the Di- 
meters anfwerable to the Weights of Iron Bullets, in this Manner : Having gotten a Rule, 
on which are denoted the Divifions of the Weights, and the Bores of Pieces (the Method of 
dividing which will be fhewn in fpeaking of the next Inflrument), open the Callipers, fo 
that the inward Ends may anfwer to the Diftance of each Point of the Divifions fhewing the 
Weights of Bullets : And then make a Notch at each Opening with a triangular File, that fo 
the End of the Tongue entering into each of thefe Notches, may fix the Opening of the 
Branches exactly to each Number of the Weights of Bullets. We commonly make Notches 
for the Diameters of Bullets weighing from one fourth of a Pound to 48 Pounds, and fome- 
times to 64 Pounds. And then Lines mufl be drawn upon the Surface of this Branch againfl 
the Notches, upon which muft be kt the correfpondent Numbers denoting the Pounds. 

The Ufe of this Inflrument is eafy, for you need but apply the two Ends of the Branches 
to the Diameter of the Bullet to be meafured ; and then the Tongue being put in a conve- 
nient Notch, will fhew the Weight of the Bullet. 

There ought always to be a certain Proportion obferved in the Breadth of the Points of this 
Inflrument ; fo that making an Angle (as the Figure fhews) at each Opening, the Infide may 
give the Weight of Bullets, and the Outfide the Bores of Pieces ; that is, that applying the 
outward Ends of thofe Points to the Diameter of the Mouths of Cannon, the Tongue, being 
placed in the proper Notch, may fhew the Weights of Bullets proper for them. 

Conjlruftion of the Gunners Square. 
F) 2- p * This Square ferves to elevate or lower Cannons or Mortars, according to the Places they 

are to be levelled at, and is made of Brafs, one Branch of which is about a Foot long, 
8 Lines broad, and one Line in Thicknefs ; the other Branch is 4 Inches long, and of the fame 
Length and Breadth as the former. Between thefe Branches there is a Quadrant divided into 
90 Deg. beginning from the fhortefl Branch, furnifhed with a Thread and Plummet. 

The 



Chap. 4. of Injlruments for Gunnery. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument is eafy, for there is no more to do but to place the longed 
Branch in the Mouth of the Cannon or Mortar, and elevate or lower it, 'till the Thread cuts 
the Degrees neceffary to hit a propofed Object. . 

There are likewife very often denoted, upon one of the Surfaces of the lono-eft Branch, 
the Divifion of Diameters and Weights of Iron Bullets, as alfo the Bores of Pieces. 

The making of this Divifion is founded upon one or two Experiments, in examinino-, 
with all poflible Exactnefs, the Diameter of a Builet, whofe Weight is very exactly known. 
For Example, having found that a Bullet, weighing four Pounds, is three Inches in Diame- 
ter, it will be eafy to make a Table of the Weights and Diameters of any other Bullets, 
becaufe, -per Prop. 18. lib. 12. EucL Bullets are to one another as the Cubes of their Diame- 
ters ; from whence it follows, that the Diameters are as the Cube Roots of Numbers, ex- 
prtffing their Weights. 

Now having found, by Experience, that a Bullet, weighing four Pounds, is three Inches 
in Diameter ; if the Diameter of a Bullet weighing 32 Pounds be required, fay, by the 
Rule of Three, As 4 is to 32, So is 27, the Cube of 3, to a fourth Number, which will be 
216; whofe Cube Root, 6 Inches, will be the Diameter of a Bullet weighing 32 Pounds. 

Or otherwife, feek the Cube Root of thefe two Numbers 4 and 32, or 1 and 8, which 
are in the fame Proportions, and you will find 1 is to 2, As 3 is to 6, which is the fame as 
before. 

But fince all Numbers have not exact Roots, the Table of homologous Sides of fimilar So- 
lids (in the Treatife of the Sector) may be ufed. If now, by help of that Table, the Dia- 
meter of an Iron Bullet, weighing 64 Pounds, be required, make a Rule of Three, whofe 
firft Term is 397, the Side of the fourth Solid •, the fecond 3 Inches, or 36 Lines, the Dia- 
meter of the Bullet weighing four Pounds \ and the third Term 1000, which is the Side of 
the 64th Solid : the Rule being finifhed, you will have 90 4 Lines for the Diameter of a 
Bullet weighing 64 Pounds. Afterwards to facilitate the Operations of other Rules of 
Three, always take, for the firft Term, the Number 1000, for the fecond 90 4 Lines, and 
for the third the Number found in the Table, over againft the Number exprelTing the Weight 
of the Bullet. As to find the Diameter of a Bullet weighing 24 Pounds, fay, As 1000 is 
to 90 4 Lines, So is 721, to 65 Lines, which is 5 Inches and 5 Lines for the Diameter 
fought. By this Method the following Table is calculated.

0/ the Curved-Pointed Compaffes. 

Thefe Compaffes do not at all differ in Conftruction from the others, of which we have Fig. CL 
already fpoken, excepting only that the Points may be taken off, and curved ones put on, 

which 



144 ^ e Conjlru£tion and Ufes Book V. 

■which ferve to take the Diameters of Bullets, and then to find their Weights, by applying 
the Diameters on the Divifions of the before- mentioned Rule. But when you would know the 
Bores of Pieces, the curve Points muft be taken off, and the ftrait ones put on, with which 
the Diameters of the Mouths of Cannon muft be taken, and afterwards they muft be applied 
to the Line of the Bores of Pieces, which is alfo fet down upon the aforefaid Rule •, by which 
means the Weights of the Bullets, proper for the propofed Cannon, may be found. 

Conflruclion of an Infirument to level Cannon and Mortars. 

Fl S- R - This Instrument is made of a Triangular Brafs Plate, about four Inches high, at the Bot- 

tom of which is a Portion of a Circle, divided into 45 Degrees •, which Number is fufficient 
for the higheft Elevation of Cannon or Mortars, and for giving Shot the greateft Range, as 
hereafter will be explained. There is a Piece of Brafs fcrewed on the Center of this Portion 
of a Circle, by which means it may be fixed or movable, according to Neceffity. 

The End of this Piece of Brafs muft be made fo, as to ferve for a Plummet and Index, in 
order to (hew the Degrees of different Elevations of Pieces of Artillery. This mftrument 
hath alfo a Brafs Foot to fet upon Cannon or Mortars, fo that when the Pieces of Cannon or 
Mortars are horizontal, the whole Infirument will be perpendicular. 

The Ufe of this Infirument is very eafy •, for place the Foot thereof upon the Piece to be 
elevated, in fuch manner that the Point of the Plummet may fall upon a convenable Degree, 
and this is what we call levelling of a Piece. 

Of the Artillery Foot-Level. 

Fig. S. The Infirument S is called a Foot-Level, and we have already fpoken of it's Conflruction ; 

but when it is ufed in Gunnery, the Tongue, ferving to keep it at right Angles, is divided 
into 90 Degrees, or rather into twice 45 Degrees from the Middle. The Thread, carrying 
the Plummet, is hung in the Center of the aforefaid Divifions, and the two Ends of the 
Branches are hollowed, fo that the Plummet may fall perpendicular upon the Middle of the 
Tongue, when the Infirument is placed level. 

To ufe it, place the two Ends upon the Piece of Artillery, which may be raifed to a pro- 
pofed Height, by means of the Plummet, whofe Thread will give the Degrees. 

Upon the Surface of the Branches of this Square, which opens quite ftrait like a Rule, are 
fet down the Weights and Diameters of Bullets, and alfo the Bores of Pieces, as we have be- 
fore explained in fpeaking of the Gunner's Square. 

Fig. T. The Infirument T is likewife for levelling Pieces of Artillery, being almoft like R, except 

only the Piece, on which are the Divifions of Degrees, is movable, by means of a round 
Rivet : that is, the Portion of the Circle (or Limb) may be turned up and adjufted to the 
Branch, fo that the Infirument takes up lefs room, and is eafier put in a Cafe. The Figure 
thereof is enough to fhew it's Conflruction, and it's Ufes are the fame as thofe of the prece- 
dent Infirument. 

Explanation of the Effecls of Cannon and Mortars. 

Fig. V. The Figure V reprefents a Mortar upon it's Carriage, elevated and difpofed for throwing 

a Bomb into a Citadel, and the Curve-Line reprefents the Path of the Bomb thro' the Air, 
from the Mouth of the Piece to it's Fall. This Curve, according to Geometricians, is a Pa- 
rabolic Line, becaufe the Properties of the Parabola agree with it ; for the Motion of the 
Bomb is compofed of two Motions, one of which is equal and uniform, which the Fire of 
the Powder gives it, and the other is an uniform accelerate Motion, communicated to it by 
it's proper Gravity. There arifes, from the Compofition of thefe two Forces, the fame Pro- 
portion, as there is between the Portions of the Axis and the Ordinates of a Parabola ; as is 
very well demonftrated by M. BlondeU in his Book, entitled, The Art of throwing Bombs. 

Maltus, an Englifh Engineer, was the firft that put Bombs in practice in France, in the Year 
1634, all his Knowledge was purely experimental ; he did not, in the leaft, know the Nature 
of the Curve they defcribe in their Paffage thro' the Air, nor their Ranges, according to dif- 
ferent Elevations of Mortars, which he could not level but tentively, by the Eflimation he 
made of the Diftance of the Place he would throw the Bomb to ; according to which he 
gave his Piece a greater or lefs Elevation, feeing whether the firft Ranges were juft or not, 
in order to lower his Mortar, if the Range was too little ; or raife it, if it was too great ; 
ufing, for that effect, a Square and Plummet, almoft like that of which we have already 
fpoken. 

The greateft Part of Officers, which have ferved the Batteries of Mortars fince Maltus's 
Time, have ufed his Elevations ; they know, by Experience, nearly the Elevation of a Mor- 
tar to throw a Bomb to a given Diftance, and augment or diminifh this Elevation in propor- 
tion, as the Bomb is found to fall beyond or fhort of the Diftance of the Place it is required 
to be thrown in. 

Yet there are certain Rules, founded upon Geometry, for finding the different Range?, 
not only of Bombs, but likewife of Cannon, in all the Sorts of Elevations ; for the Line, de- 
fcribed in the Air by a Bullet mot from a Cannon, is alfo a Parabola in all Projections, not 
only oblique ones, but right ones, as the Figure W fhews. 

A Bullet 



Chap. 4. of Inflruments for Gunnery. 1 4 q 

A Bullet going out of a Piece, will never proceed in a ftraight Line towards the Place it 
is levelled at, but will rife up from it's Line of Direction the Moment after it is out of the 
Mouth of the Piece. For the Grains of Powder nigheft the Breech, taking fire firft, prefs 
forward, by their precipitated Motion, not only the Bullet, but likewife thofe Grains of 
Powder which follow the Bullet along the Bottom of the Piece -, where fuccefllvely taking 
fire, they ftrike as it were the Bullet underneath, which, becaufe of a neceffary Vent, hat 
not the fame Diameter as the Diameter of the Bore : and fo infenfibJy raife the Bullet to- 
wards the upper Edge of the Mouth of the Piece, againft which it fo rubs in going out, 
that Pieces very much ufed, and whofe Metal is foft, are obferved to have a confiderable 
Canal there, gradually dug by the Friction of Bullets. Thus the Bullet going from the Cannon, 
as from the Point E, raifes itfelf to the Vertex of the Parabola G, after which it defcends by 
a mixed Motion towards B. 

Ranges, made from an Elevation of 45 Deg. are the greater!, and thofe made from Ele- 
vations equally diftant from 45 Deg. are equal •, that is, a Piece of Cannon, or a Mortar, 
levelled to the 40th Deg. will throw a Bullet, or Bomb, the fame Diftance, as when they are 
elevated to the 50th Degree ; and as many at 30 as 60, and fo of others, as appears in 
Fig. X. . Fig. X. 

The firft who reafoned well upon this Matter, was GaliUus, chief Engineer to the Great 
Duke of Tufcany, and after him Torricellius his Succeffor. 

They have fhewn, that to find the different Ranges of a Piece of Artillery in all Eleva- 
tions, we muft, before all things, make a very exact Experiment in firing off a Piece of 
Cannon or Mortar, at an Angle well known, and meafuring the Range made, with all the 
Exactnefs poffible : for by one Experiment well made, we may come to the Knowledge of all 
the others, in the following Manner. 

To find the Range of a Piece at any other Elevation required, fay, As the Sine of double 
the Angle under which the Experiment was made, is to the Sine of double the Angle of an 
Elevation propofed, So is the Range known by Experiment, to another. 

As fuppofe, it is found by Experiment that the Range of a Piece elevated to 30 Deg. is 
1000 Toifes : to find the Range of the fame Piece with the fame Charge, when it is elevated 
to 45 Deg. you muft take the Sine of 60 Degrees, the double of 30, and make it the firft 
Term of the Rule of Three ; the fecond Term muft be the Sine of 90, double 45 •, and the 
third the given Range 1000: Then the fourth Term of the Rule will be found 1155, the 
Range of the Piece at 45 Degrees of Elevation. 

If the Angle of Elevation propofed be greater than 45 Deg. there is no need of doubling it 
for having the Sine as the Rule directs •, but inftead of that, you muft take the Sine of double 
it's Complement to 90 Degrees: As, fuppofe the Elevation of a Piece be 50 Degrees, the 
Sine of 80 Degrees, the double of 40 Deg. muft be taken. 

But if a determinate Diftance to which a Shot is to be caft, is given (provided that Diftance 
be not greater than the greateft Range at 45 Deg. of Elevation), and the Angle of Elevation 
to produce the propofed Effect be required •, as fuppofe the Elevation of a Cannon or Mortar 
is required to caft a Shot 800 Toifes ; the Range found by Experiment muft be the firft 
Term in the Rule of Three, as for Example 1000 Toifes-, the propofed Diftance 800 
Toifes, muft be the fecond Term ; and the Sine of 60 Degrees, the third Term. The fourth 
Term being found, is the Sine of 43 Deg. 52 Min. whofe half 21 Deg. §6 Min. is the Angle 
of Elevation the Piece muft have, to produce the propofed Effect -, and if 21 Deg. 56 Min. 
be taken from 90 Deg. you will have 68 Deg. 4 Min. for the other Elevation ot the Piece, 
with which alfo the fame Effect will be produced. 

For greater Facility, and avoiding the Trouble of finding the Sines of double the Angles of 
propofjd Elevations, Galil&lt;eus and 'Torricellius have made the following Table, in which the 
Sines of the Angles fought are immediately feen.

The Ufe of this Table is thus : Suppofe it be known by Experience, that a Mortar ele- 
vated 15 Degrees, charged with three Pounds of Powder, throws a Bomb at the Difhance 
of 350 Toifes, and it is required with the fame Charge to caft a Bomb 100 Toifes further; 
feek in the Table the Number anfwering to 15 Degrees, and you will find 5000. Then form 
a Rule of Three, by faying, As 350 is to 450, So is 5000 to a fourth Number, which will 
be 6428. Find this Number, or the nigheft approaching to it, in the Table, and you will 
find it next to 20 Deg. or 70 Deg. which will produce the required Effect, and fo of others.

Of the Conftruciion and Ufe of the Englifti Callipers. 

F'g- Y. f |"^ H E S E Callipers, or Gunners CompafTes, confifl: of two long thin Pieces of Brafs, 

\ joined together by a Rivet in fuch a Manner, that one may move quite round the other. 
The Head or End of one of thefe Pieces is cut Circular, and the Plead of the other .Semi- 
Circular, the Center of which being the Center of the Rivet. The Length of each of thofe 
Pieces from the Center of the Rivet is fix Inches •, fo that when the Callipers are quite opened, 
they are a Foot long. 

One half of the Circumference of the Circular Plead, is divided into every 2 Degrees, 
every tenth of which are numbered. And on part of the other half, beginning from the 
Diameter of the Semi-Circle, when the Points of the Callipers are clofe together, are Di- 
vifions from 1 to 10, each of which are likewife fubdivided into four Parts. The Ufe of 
thefe Divifions and Subdivifions, is, that when you have taken the Diameter of any round 
thing, as a Cannon-Bali, not exceeding 10 Inches, the Diameter ot the Semi-Circle will, 
amongfl thofe Divifions, give the Length of that Diameter taken between the Points of the 
Callipers in Inches and 4th Parts. 

From this Ufe, it is manifeft how the aforefaid Divifions for Inches may be eafily made : 
For, firft, fet the Points of the Callipers together, and then make a Mark for the Beginning 
of the Divifions •, then open the Points one fourth of an Inch, and where the Diameter or 
the Semi-Circle cuts the Circumference, make a Mark for one fourth of an Inch. Then 
open the Points half an Inch, and where the Diameter of the Semi-Circle cuts the Circumfe- 
rence, make another Mark for half an Inch. In this Manner proceed for all the other Subdi- 
vifions and Divifions to Ten, 



Uoon 



Chap. 4. of the Englifri Callipers. i^y 

Upon one of the Branches, on the fame Side the Callipers, are, Firft, half a Foot or fix Inches, 
each fubdivided into ten Parts : Secondly, a Scale of unequal Divifions, beginning at two, 
and ending at ten, each of which are fubdivided into four Parts. The Conltruclion of this 
Scale or Lines will be very evident, when it's Ufe is fiiewn, which is thus : If you have a 
Mind to find how many Inches, under 10, the Diameter of any Concave, as the Diameter 
of the Bore of any Piece of Ordnance is in length, you muft open the Branches of the Cal- 
lipers, fo that the two Points may be outwards ; then taking the Diameter between the laid 
Points fee what Divifion, or Subdivifion, the outward Edge of the Branch with the Semi- 
circular Plead, cuts on the aforefaid Scale of Lines, and that will be the Number of Inches, 
or Parts, the Diameter of the Bore of the Piece is in Length. Therefore the Divifions on 
this Scale may be made in the fame Manner as I have before directed, in fiiewing how to make 
die Divifions for finding the Diameters of round Convex Bodies. 

Thirdly, The two other Scales of Lines on the fame Face of the fame Branch, mew when 
the Diameter of the Bore of a Piece of Cannon is taken with the Points of the Callipers 
outward, the Name of the Piece, whether Iron or Brafs, that is, the Weight of the Bullets 
rhev carry, or fuch and fuch a Pounder, from 42 Pounds to 1. The ConftrucYion of thefe 
Scales are from experimental Tables in Gunnery. 

On the other Branch, the fame Side of the Callipers, is, Firft, fix Inches, every of which is 
fubdivided into 10 Parts. Secondly, A Table fhewing the Weight of a Cubic Foot of Gold, 
Quick-filver, Lead, Silver, Copper, Iron, Tin, Purbec-Stovie, Chryftal, Brimftone, Water, 
Wax, Oil, and dry Wood. 

On the other Side of the Callipers, is a Line of Chords to about three Inches Radius, and Fig. %\ 
a Line of Lines on both Branches, the fame as on the Sector. 

There is alfo a Table of the Names of the following Species of Ordnance, viz. a Falconet, 
a Falcon, a Three-Pounder, a Minion, a Sacker, a Six- Pounder, an Eight-Pounder, a Deml- 
Culverin, a Twelve-Pounder, a Whole-Culverin, a Twenty-four-Pounder, a Demi-Cannon, 
Baflard-Cannon, and a Whole-Cannon. Under thefe are the Quantities of Powder neceffary 
for each of their Proofs, and alfo for their Service. 

Upon the fame Face is a Hand graved, and a Right Line drawn from the Finger towards 
the Center of the Rivet. Which Right Line Ihews, by cutting certain Divifions made on 
the Circle, the Weight of Iron-fhot, when the Diameters are taken with the Points of the Cal- 
lipers, if they are of the following Weights, viz. 42, 32, 24, 18, 12, 9, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1, 1 ', 
j, Pounds. Thefe Figures are not all fet to the Divifions on the Circumference, tor avoiding 
Confufion. The aforefaid Divifions on the Circumference may be thus made : Firft, When 
the Points of the Callipers are clofe, continue the Line drawn from the Finger on the Limb, 
to reprefent the Beginning of the Divifions. Now, becaufe from Experience it is found, that 
an Iron Ball or Globe weighing one Pound is 1.8 of an Inch, open the Callipers, fo that the 
Diftance between the two Points may be 1.8 of an Inch ; and then, where the Line drawn 
from the Finger cuts the Circumference, make a Mark for the Divifion 1. Again, to find 
where the Divifion 1.5 muft be, fay, As 1 is to the Cube of 1.8, So is 1.5 to the Cube of the 
Diameter of an Iron Ball weighing 1.5 Pounds, whofe Root extracted will give 2.23 Inches. 
Therefore open the Points of the Callipers, fo that they may be 2.23 Inches diftant from 
each other ; and then, where the Line drawn from the Finger cuts the Circumference, make 
a Mark for the Divifion 1 \ . The Reafon of this is, becaufe the Weights of Homogeneous 
Bodies, are to each other as their Magnitudes ; and the Magnitudes of Globes and Spheres, 
are to each other as the Cubes of their Diameters. 

Proceed in the aforefaid Manner, in always making 1 the firft Term of the Rule of Three, 
and the Cube of 1.8 the fecond, &amp;c. and all the Divifions will be had. 

Upon the Circle or Head, on the fame Side of the Callipers, are graved feveral Geometrical 
Figures, with Numbers fet thereto. There is a Cube whofe Side is fuppofed to be 1 Foot, or 
12 Inches, and a Pyramid of the fame Bafe and Altitude over it: On the Side of the Cube is 
graved 470, fignifying that a Cubic Foot of Iron weighs 470 Pounds •, and on the Pyramid 
is graved 156 -*-, fignifying that the Weight of it is fo many Pounds. 

The next is a Sphere, fuppofed to be inferibed in a Cube of the fame Dimenfions, as the 
former Cube, in which is writ 246^, which is the Weight of that Sphere or Iron. The next 
is a Cylinder, the Diameter and Altitude of which is equal to the Side of the aforefaid Cube, 
and a Cone over it, of the fame Bafe and Altitude; there is fet to the Cylinder 369 - 1 .,, fig- 
nifying, that a Cylinder of Iron of that Bignefs, weighs 369 - t ? T , and to the Cone 121 T -2-o&gt; 
fignilying, that a Cone of Iron of that Bignefs weighs 121 ^^ Pounds. 

The next is a Cube inferibed in a Sphere of the fame Dimenfions as the aforefaid Sphere. 
There is fet to it the Number 90 -?, fignifying, that a Cube of Iron inferibed in the faid 
Sphere, weighs 90 J - Pounds. 

^ The next is a Circle inferibed in a Square, and a Square in that Circle, and again a 
Circle in the latter Square. There is fet thereto the Numbers 2S, n, 22, and 14, fignifying, 
that if the Area of the outward Square be 28, the Area of it's inferibed Circle is 22, and the 
Area of the Square inferibed in the Circje 14, and the Area of the Circle inferibed in the 
latter Square 1 1 .

The next and laft, is a Circle croffed with two Diameters at Right Angles, having in it 
the Numbers 7, 22, 113 and 355 ; the two former of which reprefent the Proportion of the 
Diameter of a Circle to it's Circumference ; and the two latter alfo the Proportion of the Dia- 
meter to the Circumference. But fomething nearer the Truth. 

I have already, as it were, fhewn the Ufes of this Inftrument ; but only of the Degrees 
on the Head, which are to take the Quantity of an Angle, the manner of doing which is eafy : 
For if the Angle be an inward Angle, as the Corner of a Room, &amp;c. apply the two outward 
Edges of the Branches to the Walls or Planes forming the Angles, and then the Degrees cut 
by the Diameter of the Semi-Circle, will fhew the Quantity of the Angle fought. But if 
the Angle be an outward Angle, as the Corner of a Houfe, &amp;c. you mu ft open the Branches 
'till the two Points of the Callipers are outwards ; and then apply the ftraight Edges of the 
Branches to the Planes, or Walls, and the Degrees cut by the Diameter of the Semi-Circle, 
will be the Quantity of the Angle fought, reckoning from 180 towards the Right-Hand.

Of the ConftruSlion and Ufes of the Aftronomical Quadrant. 




StpT 







E Quadrants ufed by Aftronomers for Celeftial Obfervations, arc 

fually three Feet, or three Feet and a half (of Paris) Radius, that fo 

they may be eafily managed and carried from Place to Place. Their 

Limbs are divided into Degrees and Minutes, that fo Obfervations made 

with them may be very exact. 

This Inftrument is compofed of feveral pretty thick Iron or Brafs 
Rulers, whofe Breadths ought to be parallel to it's PJane. There are 
moreover other Iron or Brafs Rulers, fo adjufted and joined behind the 
former ones, that their Breadths are perpendicular to the Plane of the Quadrant. Thefe Rulers 
are joined together by Screws, by means of which the whole Conjunction of the Inftrument 
is made, which ought to be very ftrait every way, firm, and pretty weighty. The Limb is 
likewife ftrengthened with a curved Brafs, or Iron Ruler. There is a thick ftrong circular 
Blade placed in the Center, ferving for the Ufes hereafter mentioned ; which circular Blade 
and the Limb muft be railed fomething higher than the Plane of the Inftrument, both of 
which muft be covered with well-polifhed thin Pieces of Brafs. But you muft take great 
care that the Surfaces of thefe Pieces of Brafs be both in the fame Plane. 

The aforefaid circular Iron Blade in the Center muft have a round Hole in the Middle 
thereof, about '- of an Inch in Diameter, in which is placed a well-turned Brafs Cylinder, 
raifed fomething above the central thin Piece of Brafs. 

This Cylinder, which is reprefented in Figure 2, hath the Point of a very fine Needle ad- 
jufted in the Center of it's Bafe, which is fupported in going into a little Hole in the Center 
of the Bafe, and by lying along a femi-circular Cavity, and is kept therein by means of a little 
Spring preffing againft it ; fo that when the Needle is taken away, and we have a Mind to 
put it there again, it may exactly be placed in the little Hole in the Center of the laid Cy- 
linder. This little Hole ought to be no bigger than a Hair, but it muft be fomething deep, 
that fo the Point of the Needle may go far enough into it, that at the making of the Qua- 
drant it may not come out. At the Point of this Needle is hung a Hair, by means of a 
Ring made with the fame Hair big enough, for fear left the Knot of the Ring fliould touch 
the central Plate, and the Motion of the Hair be difturbed. Note, The Bafe of the cen- 
tral Cylinder A, reprefented in this Figure, muft be fuch, that the Ring of the Hair, hung

on the Point of the Needle, may not touch the faid Bafe otherwife than in it's Center, when 
there is a Plummet hung to the End of the Hair, of about half an Ounce in weight. 

The Conftruction of this central Cylinder ought to be fuch, that it may be taken away 
and preferved, and another placed inftead thereof, of the fame Thicknefs therewith, but 
fomething longer; which coming out beyond the central Blade, fuftains the Ruler of the In- 
ftrument, in luch manner as we are going to explain. 

There is moreover, at the central Brafs Blade, which covers the Iron one, a plane Rino- 
F 'g- 3- A, turning about the Center, but not touching the central Cylinder •, in fuch manner, that 

the outward Surface thereof is even with the Surface of the laid Brafs Blade. Upon this 
Ring is fattened, with two Screws, a flat Tube M, which moves freely along with the Hair 
and Plummet, which it covers, and fo preferves it from the Wind when the Inftrument is 
ufing. 

This Tube carries a Glafs, placed againft the Divifions of the Limb of the Quadrant, 
in order to fee what Point of Divifion the Hair falls upon. Behind, and nigh to, the Center 
of Gravity of the Quadrant, is firmly fixed, with three or four Screws, to the Rulers of the 
Inftrument, the Iron Cylinder I, whofe Length is 8 Inches, and Diameter of it's Bafe two 
Inches. This Cylinder being perpendicular to the Plane of the Quadrant, may be called it's 
Axis. 

Now becaufe the principal Ufe of this Inftrument is for taking the Altitudes of the Sun or 
Stars, it muft be fo ordered, that it's Plane may be eafily placed in a vertical Situation ; 
f'g- 4. therefore an Iron Ruler M N muft be prepared, whole Thicknefs is three Lines, Length 

eight Inches, and Breadth one Inch, or thereabouts. On one Side of this Ruler are ad- 
jufted two Iron Rings Z Z, open a-top with Ears, each of which has a Screw to draw the 
Ears clofer together, which have a Spring. The Bignefs of thefe Rings is nearly equal to the 
Thicknefs of the Cylinder I, or Axis of the Quadrant, which being put thro' them, is made 
faft with the Screws ; fo that the Axis and Quadrant, which it is fixed to, may remain firm 
in any Pofition the Quadrant is put into. 

On the other Side of the faid Ruler M N is foldered an Iron Cylinder O, of fuch a Length 
and Breadth, as to go into the Tube Q^, of which we are going to fpeak. 

Now when the Inftrument is to be placed fo, that it's Plane may be horizontal, for ufing 
an Index or moveable Arm to take the Diftances of Stars or Places upon Earth, the Cylinder 
I. muft be put into the Tube Q^, by which means the Quadrant may be eafily turned to what 
part you pleafe. 
Fig. 5. The Foot, or Support of the whole Inftrument, is commonly compofed of an Iron Tube 

Qj whofe upper Part is capable of containing the Cylinder O, and it's lower Part goes thro' 
the Middle of an Iron Crofs, and is fattened in it by four Iron Arms, at the four Ends of 
which Crofs are four great Screws, to raife or lower the Quadrant, and put it in a convenient 
Situation. But Monfieur de la Hire propofes a Triangular Support in his Tables, which is 
compofed of an Iron or Brafs Tube, big enough to contain the Cylinder O, fattened with 
two Screws to three Iron Rulers R S, bent towards their Tops, and of a pretty good 
Thicknefs, which are adjufted and well fixed to a Tee or double Square T X Y. The 
Screw V, in the Middle of the Tube Qj is for fixing the Cylinder O, according to Ne- 
ceflity. 

Now when the Meridian Altitudes of Stars are to be obferved, the Ruler T Y ought to 
be placed in the Meridian Line, and of the three Screws T X Y, which fuftain the Weight 
of the whole Inftrument; that which is in X ferves to lower the Plane of the Inftrument, 
'till it anfwers to the Plane of the Meridian, according as the Obferver would have it; and 
the other two are for raifing or lowering the Inftrument by little and little, until the Plumb- 
Line falls upon the requifite Altitude. But it often happens in turning the Screws that 
are in T and Y, that the Quadrant difplaces'itfelf from it's true Poficion ; whence, if the 
Defect be fome Minutes, this may be remedied, by hanging a moveable Weight to the Back- 
fide of. the Branches of the Inftrument, which may alter the Center of Gravity, as likewife 
change the Inclination of the Quadrant; for the Rulers compofing the Foot are not entirely 
free trom Elafticity. Now the nigher to the Foot the Place of Sufpenfion of the Weight is, 
the lefs Force will it have to fhake the Inftrument. Note, The Fleight of the Foot is com- 
monly four Feet and a half, or thereabouts, and the fame Ufe is equally made of the four 
Branch Support. 

Thie Divifions on the Limb of this Quadrant ought to be made with great Care, that fo 
Obfervations may thereby be exactly taken. Each Degree is divided into 60 Minutes, by 
Fig. 6. means of n concentrick Circles, and 6 Diagonal right Lines, as in Figure 6 may be feen. 

Thefe Diagonal Diftances are equal between themfelves, but thofe of the Concentrick Cir- 
cles are unequal ; yet this Inequality is not fenfible, if the Radius of the Quadrant be three 
Feet, and the Diftance between the two outmoft concentrick Circles be one Inch ; for if the 
Arc A E, of the outmoft Circle be 10 Minutes, and there are drawn, from the Center C of 
the Quadrant, the Radii A DC, EBC, meeting the inner concentrick Circle in the Points 
D, B, the Arc D B will be likewife 10 Minutes. Note, Figure 6 is fuppofed to be put up- 
on the Limb of the Inftrument, Figure 1. 

•■* But 



Chap, i i of the Aftronomical Quadrant. i r i 

But if the Right-lined Diagonals A B, D E, are drawn interfecting each other in the Point 
F ; I lay F is the middle Point or Divifion thro' which the middle Circle ought to pafs : For 
the Arcs A E, B D, which may be taken for firait Lines, are to each other, as A F is to 
FB : for it is evident, that C A is to C B, as the Divifions of the Bafe AB of the Right- 
lined Triangle ACB; bur fince C A is to C B as A E is to D B, therefore A E is toDB, 
as the Divifions of the Bafe A B made by a Radius, bifccting the Angle A C B : and confe- 
quently the Point F, before found in the Right-lined Diagonal AB, will be the middle Point 
of the Divifions. 

Now let us fuppofe, that A C be to C B, as 36 Inches is to 35 ; then A B is to A F, as 
71 is to 36. Therefore if the Breadth of one Inch, or 12 Lines, which is the fuppofed Mea- 
fure of A B, be divided into 71 equal Parts, the Part AF will be 36 of them, which will 
be greater by half, or about -j- 1 . of a Line, than half of A B, which is but 35 4. This Diffe- 
rence is of no confequence, and may, without any fenfible Error, be neglected in the Divifion 
of the Middle ; and much more in the other Divifions, where it is lefs. 

Inftead of making Right-Jined Liagonals, we may make them Portions of Circles palling 
thro' the Center of the Inftrumcnt, and the firft and laft Point of the fame Diagonal-, then 
we need but divide the firll Circular Portion into ten equal Parts, and the exact Points will 
be had thro' which the eleven Concentrick Circles muft pais. 

The Radius of this firll: Portion may be eafily found ; and then if a thin Ruler be bent 
into the Curvature thereof, all the other Portions may be drawn by means of it, as we have 
already mentioned in fpeaking of the Divifions of Quadrants, Semi-Circles, &amp;c. 

Note, It will be proper to leave, at the Bottom of the Limb, the Points that were made 
for drawing every 10th A'linute ; for thefe will be a means to take the Correfpondent Alti- 
tudes of the Sun, Morning and Evening, much exacter than can be done by the Diagonals, 
becaufe of the Eftimation thereby avoided. Moreover, there may be fome fault in the Dia- 
gonals which there cannot be in the Points, if care be taken in making them : for it is diffi- 
cult enough to draw the Diagonals exactly thro' thofe Points they fhould pafs. For which 
reafon, if a Micrometer be joined to the fixed Telefcope of the Inftrument, the Diagonals 
need not be ufed, and the aforefaid Points will be fufficient ; fince the Micrometer will give, 
by means of a moveable Hair, the Interval between the neareft of one of the aforefaid 
Points, at every 10th Minute, and the Plummet. And this is done by raifing or lowering 
the moveable Hair above or below the horizontal Hair, 10 Minutes of a Degree, or a little 
more. The Chevalier de Louville, of the Academy of Sciences, hath fatisfactorily ufed a 
Quadrant for his Obfervations, conftructed in this Manner. 

We now come to fpeak of the Telcfcopes, and the Manner of finding the firft Point of 
the Divifions of the Limb of the Quadrant. 

Thefe Telefcopes have each two Glaffcs, one of which is the Object-Glafs, placed towards 
the vifible Object, and near to the Center of the Quadrant ; and the other is the Eye-Glafs, 
placed at the other End or the Telefcope, next to the Eye of the Obferver. 

The Object-Glafs is firmly fattened in an Iron Frame, which is fixed with Screws about the 
Center of the Inftrument. Near the Eye-Glafs are placed two fine Hairs, croffing each 
other at Right An-ies, in an iron Frame, to which they are fattened with Wax upon a little 
piece of Brafs ; fo that the one is perpendicular to the Plane of the Inftrument, and the other 
parallel thereto. 

The Eye-Glafs muft be placed in a Tube, that fo it may be moved backwards or forwards, 
according to different Sights •, and the Diftance between the Object-Glafs and Crofs-Hairs, 
muft be the faid Glafs's Focal Length ; that is, the Crofs-Hairs muft be placed in the Focus 
of the Object-Glafs. Thefe Telefcopes muft be fo difpofed, that the Surfaces of the Lenfes 
(as Planes) and the Planes in which are the Crofs-Hairs, be parallel to each other, and per- 
pendicular to Right Lines drawn thro' the Centers of the Lenfes, and the Points wherein the 
Flairs crofs each other. Thefe Telefcopes are adjufted behind the Quadrant, that fo the 
divided Brafs- Limb may not be incumbered by them. 

Between the Frames fuftaining the Glaffes, is a Brafs or Iron Tube, compofed of two 
Parts, one of which is inchafed in the other, that fo they may eafily be taken from between 
the Frames, by means of Ferrels keeping them together. 

The Convex Eye-Lens mutt be brought nearer, or removed further from the Crofs-Hairs, 
according to the diverfe Conftitutions of Obfervators Eyes ; that fo diftant Objects may be 
diftinctly perceived, as likewife the Crofs-Hairs. This Eye-Glafs is placed in another little 
moveable Tube, the greateft part of which lies concealed in another lube, as may be feen in 

When the Eye-Glafs wants cleanfing, or the Crofs-Hairs are broken or difordered, and 
others to be put in their place, the before-mentioned Brafs or Iron Tube muft be taken from 
between the Frames. 

But the Conftruction of the Eye-Glafs will be much more convenient, if, inftead of a Frame Fig. 7. 
only, you ufe a little fquare Box, about four Lines in Thicknefs, whofe two oppofite Sides, 
which are parallel to the Limb of the Quadrant, have Grooves along them, in which may 
move a little Plate of a mean Thicknefs, drilled thro' the Middle with a round Hole of a con- 
venient bignefs. 

Upon 



j 3 % The ConJlruBion and Ufes Book VI. 

Upon the Surface of this Plate, reprefented by the Figure a, are continued out two Dia- 
meters of the aforefaid Hole, eroding each other at Right Angles, one of which is parallel to 
the Limb, and the other perpendicular thereto, upon which are placed the Crofs-Hairs. This 
Plate is very ufeful for moving the faid Crofs-Hairs, (trained at Right Angles a-crofs the 
Middle of the Hole, backwards or forwards, according to necefTity. And when the Hairs are 
placed as they fhould be, the aforefaid Plate is fixed to the Box with Wax, which ought to be 
furnifhed with a Aiding Cover, for keeping the Crofs-Hairs from Accidents. 

The Infide of the Tube ought to be blackened with the Smoke of Rofin, in order to pre- 
fefve the Eye from too ftrong Rays which come from a luminous Object, that fo the Ap- 
pearance thereof may be more perfect. Note, Inftead of having Crofs-Hairs in the before- 
mentioned Box, a little Piece of plain Glafs may be ufed, having two fine Lines drawn upon 
it at Right Angles with the Point of a Diamond. 

The Tekfcope being prepared and placed in a convenient Situation parallel to the Radius, 
or Side of the Quadrant ; the next thing to be done, is to find the firft Point of the Divifions 
of the Limb of the Quadrant, which is 90 Degrees diftant from the Line of Collimation or 
Sight of the Tekfcope, or a Line parallel to it, pafling thro' the Center of the Quadranr. 
But, Firff, it will be necefiary to fay fomething concerning this Line of Collimation, or Sight, 
about which M. de la Hire fays, he had formerly a long Controverfy, with very celebrated 
and great Aftronomers, who, for want of duly confidering Dioptricks, maintained, that it is 
impoflible to find a fettled and conftantLine of Collimation in thefe kind of Telefcopes. 

It is now manifeft, that all the Rays proceeding from any one Point of an Object, after 
having pafled thro' the Glafs Lens, will all concur in one and she fame Point, which is called 
the Focus, provided that the Diftance of the Radiating Point from the Lens be greater than 
the Semidiameter of either of the Convexities of the Lens, which here we fuppok equal -, 
that befides, among the Rays coming from a Radiating Point, and falling upon the anterior 
Surface of the Glafs, that which concurs with a Line pafling thro' the Centers of the Convexi- 
ties, will fuffer no Refraction at it's going in or coming out of the Glafs ; therefore the Points 
of Objects that are in that Right Line, are reprefented in the fame Line, which is called the 
Axis of the Optick Tube, and the Point of the Axis which is in the Middle of the Glafs's 
thicknefs, is called the Center of the Lens. 

If the Right Line pafling thro' the Center of the Lens, and the Point where the Hairs crofs 
one another, agree with the Axis of the faid Optick Tube, it will be the Line of Collimation 
of the Tekfcope ; and an Object very diftant, placed in the Axis produced, will appear in the 
fame Point where the Hairs crofs one another : juft as in^common Indexes, where we take 
For the Line of Sight, the Right Line, that pafling thro' the Slits of the Sights, tends to the 
Object. But altho' it almoft never happens in the Polition of Telefcopes, which we have 
eftablifhed, that the Right Line tending from the Object to the Point wherein the Hairs 
trofs, and whereat the Object is reprefented, coincides with the Optick Axis ; neverthelefs 
we ftiall not defift finding that Line of Collimation tending from the Object to it's Picture, 
reprefented in the Point wherein the Flairs crofs each other ; which may be done in the 
following Manner. 
Fig. 8. Let X V be a Glafs Lens, it's Axis A C B, and it's Center C •, let F be the Point wherein the 

Hairs crofs one another without the Axis A C B. If from the Point F, which by Conftruc- 
tion is at the Focal Diftance from the Lens, Rays pafs thro' the Glafs, they will fuffer a Re- 
fraction at their Entrance into the Glafs, and a fecond Refraction at their going out thereof; 
after which, they will continue their way parallel to one another. Now there is one of thefe 
Rays, namely, F E, which coming from the Point F, after the firft Refraction in the Point E, 
pafles thro' the Center C; for after a fecond Refraction at it's going out of the Glafs in the 
Point D, it will continue it's way from Dto O, parallel to F E, according to Dioptrick Rules. 
But all the Rays feparated at their going out of the Glafs may be taken as parallel, if they 
tend to a very diftant Point O, therefore they are alfo parallel to the Ray F E O, which 
is produced from the Object directly to the Point O •, and it is this Right Line FE O, which 
we call the Line of Collimation, in the aforefaid Pofition of Telefcopes, and it will always 
remain the fame, if the Situation of the Glafles be not changed, that is, if the Lens and the 
Crofs-Hairs are in the fame Pofition and Diftance. The Object O being in one of the extreme 
Points of the Right Line F E O, will be reprefented in the Point F. 

Note, The Diftance between the principal Ray O D, falling from the Point O of the 
Object upon the Lens, and it's refracted Ray E F, is always lefier than the Thicknefs of the 
faid Lens D E, which is infenfible, and of no Importance, in the Diftance of a very diftant 
Object, and the Diftance of the parallel Rays O D, O E F, will be fo much the lefs, as the 
Lens is more directly turned towards the Pofition of the Crofs-Hairs. 

We come now to fhew how to find the firft Point of the Divifions of the Limb of the 
Quadrant, which is thus : Having fixed the Plane of the Quadrant in a vertical Pofition, by 
means of the Plumb-Line CD, direct the Telefcope towards a very diftant vifible Point, 
nigh to the Senfible Horizon, in refpect of the Place where the Telefcope of the Inftrument 
is placed ; which may be firft known by marking the Point B upon the Limb, in the Radius 
C B, parallel to the Axis of the Tube, which may be nearly done -, and by taking the Point 
D, diftant from the Point B 90 Degrees ; for when the Piumb-Line falls upon the Point D, 

the 



Chap. I. of the Aft r on otnical Quadrant, i^ 

the Object appearing m the Point wherein the Hairs crofs one another, will be nigh to the 
Horizon ; for the Scnfible Horizon muft be at Right Angles with the Plumb-Line CD. But 
fince we are noi yet certain whether the Telefcope be perfectly Horizontal, the Inftrument 
mult be turned upfide down, fo that the Point D may be above, and the Center below; 
but it is necefr- ry in this Tranfpofition, that the Line of Collimation be at the fame Height as 
it was in the tint Pofition. Llaving again directed the Telefcope towards the Point firft ob- 
ferved, fo that it may appear in the Point wherein the Hairs crofs, and having adjufted the 
Cylinder in the Center of the Inftrument, fallen the Plumb-Line with Wax upon the Limb 
in the Point D ; and if it exactly falls upon the Center C, it is certain that the Line of Colli- 
mation is horizontal. For this Line of Collimation will remain the fame in both Situations of 
the Quadrant, and produced with the Vertical Line C D, the Point D will be the Beginning 
of the Bivifions of the Limb. 

But if, after having turned the Inftrument upfide down, the Plumb-Line fufpended at 
the Point D, does not precifely fall upon the Center C, you muft move it 'till it does pafs 
thro' it, not any wife changing the Pofition of the Quadrant, nor the Glaffes of the Telefcope ; 
and then the Point E, upon which the Plumb-Line falls, muft be marked in the circular Arc 
D E, defenbed about the Center C, paffing thro' the Point D. 

Now, I fay, if the Arc D E be bifected in the Point O, this Point will be the firft Point 
of the Divifions of the Limb, and the Radius CO will be at Right Angles with the Line of 
Collimation. This Operation is very manifeft, for the Line of Collimation, or the Radius C B, 
parallel to it, will not be changed in either of the Pofitions of the Quadrant, if the Angle 
BCD, in the natural Situation of the Inftrument, be greater than a Right Angle •, that is, 
if the Point of an Object: the Telefcope is directed to, be under the Horizon, it is manifeft 
that the Vertical Line C D produced, anfwering to the Plumb-Line, makes with the Line of 
Collimation an Angle lels than a right one, viz. the Complement of the Angle BCD, which 
is -qua! to the Angle BCE; therefore the Angle BCD, which is a Mean between that 
which is greater than a right one, and that leffer, made by the Radius C O, and the Line of 
Collimation, will be a right Angle ; which was to be proved. 

We may yet otherwife have the firft Point of the Divifions of the Limb, by knowing a 
Point perfectly level with the Eye •, then placing the Telefcope in that Point, and that place 
of theLirnb upon which the Plumb-Line plays, will give the firft Point of Divifion. 

The Proof of this Operation is juftified, if (the Plumb-Line paffing thro' the Point O) 
a very diftant Object appears in the Point wherein the Hairs crofs one another. For having 
inverted the Inftrument, and the Telefcope being always directed towards the fame Object, 
the Plumb-Line will pafs thio' the Points O and C, otherwife there will be fome Error in the 
Obfervations. 

Being well allured of the firft Point of the Divifions of the Limb, you muft draw about; 
the Center C two Portions of Circles, an Inch diftance from each other, between which the 
Divifions of the Limb are to be included ; to do which, you muft ufe a Beam-Compafs, 
v/hofe Points are very fine, one of which, next to the End, moves backwards or forwards, 
by help of a Screw and Nut, which is adjufted to the End of the Branch of the Com- 
pafs. 

Then one of the Points of the Compafs being placed in O, the firft Point of the Divifions 
of the Limb, and the other being diftant therefrom the Length of the Radius of one or the 
laid concentrick Arcs, make a Mark upon the correfpondent concentrick Arc, which ex- 
actly divide into two equal Parts, one of which being laid off beyond the Mark, will give 
the Point B ; and fo the Quadrant O B will be divided into three equal Parts, each being 
30 Degrees. 

Thefe Parts being each divided into three more, and each of thefe lafl into two ; and, 
finally, each of the Parts arifing into five more equal ones ; the Quadrant will be divided in- 
to 90 Degrees, each of which being again divided into fix equal Parts, every 10th Minute 
will be had. 

The outward and inward concentrick Arcs of the Limb being very exactly divided, as 
we have directed, very fine Lines muft diagonally be drawn thereon •, that is, from the firit 
Point of Divifion of the inward Arc, to the fecond Point of Divifion of the outward Arc ; 
and fo on from one Divifion in the inward Arc to the next enfuing Divifion of the outward 
Arc, as appears in Fig. 6. This being done, the Diftance between the outward and inward 
Arcs muft be divided into 10 equal Parts, thro' each Point of Divifion of which, muft nine 
concentrick Arcs be drawn about the Center of the Quadrant C, which will divide the Dia- 
gonals into ten Parts ; and fo the Limb of the Inftrument will be divided into Degrees and 
Minutes. Great care ought to be taken, that fo the Divifions may be very exactly drawn 
equal •, and that they may be as exact as poiTible, very good and fine Compaffes exquifitely 
to draw the Lines and Circles muft be ufed ; and in making the feveral Divifions, we ufe fine 
Spring Compaffes, whofe Points are as fine as a Needle, and a good dividing Knife. JSote, 
The Divifions of the Limb of the Quadrant for certain Ufes, are continued about 5 Degrees 
beyond the Point O. 

R r After 



J&gt; 



j t- a The Conjhucfion and Ufes Book VI. 

After this Inftrument hath been carried in a Coach, or on Horfeback, &amp;c. care ought to 
be taken to prove it, for fear left the Ghffes of the Telefcope fhould have been dilbrdered, or 
the Crofs-Hairs removed, which often happens. Likewife when the Tube of the Telefcope, 
if the Inftrument be not conveyed, as aforefaid, is expofed to the Heat of the Sun, the Crofs- 
Hairs are too much ilretched, and afterwards when the Sun is abi'ent, they relax and become 
flack, and fo are not very fit to be ufed : yet neverthelefs, if you think the Crofs-Hairs have 
not been moved, there is no necefllty of proving the Telefcope, becaufe the Object-Glafs re- 
mains immoveable, and always the fame ; and the Crofs-Hairs, which by the Moifture of the 
Air are flackened, will often become tight again in fine Weather. 

NOTE) If a Telefcope be placed to an Inftrument already divided, it is very difficult 
to make it agree with the Divifions of the Limb ; therefore having proved it, according to 
the Directions before given, we fhall find how much greater or leiler than a Right Angle the 
Telefcope makes, with a Radius pafllng thro' the firft Point of the Divifions of the Limb, 
and this Difference muft be regarded in all Obfervations made with the Inftrument: For if the 
Angle be greater than a Right one, all Altitudes obferved will be greater than the true ones 
by the Quantity of the faid Difference ; and contrariwife, if the aforenamed Angle be lefier 
than a Right Angle, the true Altitudes will be greater than the obferved ones. Notwith- 
standing this, the Crofs-Hairs may be fo placed, that the Line of Collimation of the Telefcope 
may make a Right Angle with the Radius pafllng thro' the firft Point of Divifion of the&gt; 
Quadrant, in applying the Crofs-Hairs on a moveable Plate, as we have mentioned in the 
Conftruction. But becaufe in conveying this Inftrument to diftant Places, the Proof thereof 
muft be often made-, and fince the Method already laid down is Subject to great Inconve- 
niencies, as well on account of the Difficulty of inverting the Inftrument, fo that the Tube of 
the Telefcope may be at the fame Height, as becaufe of the different Refractions of the At- 
mofphere near the Horizon, at different Hours of the Day ; as likewife becaufe of the Agita- 
tion and Undulation of the Air, and other the like Obftacles : Therefore we fhall here fliew 
two other ways of rectifying thefe Inftruments, that fo any one may chufe that which appears 
mod convenient for him. 

Now the firft of thefe Methods is this : You muft chufe fome Place from whence a diftant 
Object may be perceived diftinctly, at lead iooo Toifes, and whofe Elevation above the 
Horizon .does not exceed the Number of Degrees of the Limb of the Quadrant continued 
out beyond the Beginning of the Divifions. Now after you have obferved the Altitude of 
the faid Object, as it appears by the Degrees of the Limb, a Pail brim-full of Water, or 
fome broad-mouthed Veffel, muft be placed before, and as nigh to the Quadrant as pofllble, 
which muft be raifed or lowered until the faid Object be perceived thro' the Telefcope upon 
the Surface of the Water, as in a Looking-Glafs, which will not be difficult to do •, provided 
the Surface of the Water be not difturbed by the Wind ; whence the Depreflion of the faid 
Object will be had in Degrees by Reflexion, and it will appear in an erect Situation, becaufe 
the Telefcope is compofed of two convex Glaffes, which reprefent Objects inverted, tut by 
Reflexion inverted Objects appear erect, and erect Objects inverted. 

But you ought to obferve, that when the Angle made by the Line of Collimation, and the 
Radius pafllng thro' the firft Point of the Divifions of the Limb, is greater than a right one, 
the Depreflion of the aforefaid Object will appear as an Altitude •, that is, when you look 
thro' the Telefcope at the Image of the Object in the Surface of the Water, the Plumb-Line 
of the Quadrant will fall on the left Side of the firft Point O of the Divifions of the Limb, 
and not on the Divifions continued out beyond the Point O. And contrariwife, in other 
Cafes, when the Angle the Line of Collimation makes with the Radius pafllng thro' the firft 
Point of the Divifions of the Limb, is leffer than a right one, the Altitude of the Object 
will appear by the Divifions of the Limb, as tho' it was depreffed •, that is, when you look 
at the aforefaid Object thro' the Telefcope, the Plumb-Line of the Quadrant will fall upon 
the Divifions of the Limb continued out beyond the Point O. But in all Cafes, without 
regarding the Degrees of Altitude or Depreffion, denoted by the Plumb-Line, when the 
Object and it's Image, in the Surface of the Water, is efpied thro' the Telefcope, the exact 
middle Point between the two Places whereon the Plumb-Line falls at both Obfervations on 
the Limb, is vertical, and anfwers to the Zenith with refpect to the Line of Collimation of 
the Telefcope. 

Now having found the Error of the Inftrument, that is, the Difference between the firft 
Point of the Divifions of the Limb, and the faid middle Point anfwering to the Zenith, you 
muft try to place the Crofs-Hairs in their true Pofition, if you can conveniently ; but if nor, 
regard muft be had to the Error in all Obfervations, whether of Elevation, or Depreflion. 

But note, if the Object be near, and elevated fome Minutes above the Horizon, the true 
Error of the Inftrument may be found in the following Manner. 

We have three things given in a Triangle, one of which is the known Diftance between the 
Place of Obfervation and the Object ; the other the Diftance between the Middle of the Te- 
lefcope, and the Point of the Surface of the Water, upon which a reflected Ray falls ; and 
the laft, the Angle included between thofe two Sides ; that is, the Arc of the Limb contained 
between the two Places of the Limb upon which the Plumb-Line falls in, obferving, as afore- 
faid, the Object and it's Image on the Surface of the Water thro' the Telefcope: I fay, we 

have 



Chap. 2. of the Micrometer. 2^5 

have the faid two Sides and included Angle given, to find the Angle oppofite to the leffer 
Side. This being done, if the Arc of the Limb included between the two Places whereon 
the Plumb-Line falls, in obferving, as aforefaid, be diminifhed, on the Side of the Limb pro- 
duced, by the Quantity of the Angle found, the Middle of the remaining Arc will be the 
true vertical Point. Note, To find the Diftance between the Middle of the Tube of the 
Telefcope, and the Point of the Surface of the Water upon which the reflected Rays fall, 
you may ufe a Rod or Thread prolonged from the faid Tube to the Surface of the Water. 

The other way (which is very fimple, but yet not eafy) of proving whether the Line of 
Collimation of the fixed Telefcope be right, is thus: We fuppofe in this Method, that the 
Limb of the Quadrant is continued out, and divided into fbme few Degrees beyond 90. 
Now in fome ferene ftill Night, we take the Meridian Altitude of fome Star near the Zenith, 
having firft turned the divided Face of the Limb of the Quadrant towards the Eaft. This 
bein°- done, within a Night or two after, we again obferve the Altitude of the fame Star, 
the divided Face of the Limb being Weftward. Then the Middle of the Arc of the Limb 
between the Altitudes at each Obfcrvation, will be the Point of 90 Deg. that is, a Point thro* 
which a Radius of the Quadrant paffes, parallel to the Line of Collimation of the Telefcope. 
Note, This Method is very ufeful for proving the Pofition of Telefcopes, which are adjufted 
not only to Quadrants, but principally to Sextants, Octants, &amp;c. for by means thereof may 
be found which of the Radii of the feveral Inftruments are parallel to the Lines of Collima- 
tion of the Telefcope. 

We fhall hereafter fliew the Manner of taking the Altitudes of Celeftial Bodies ; as like- 
wife how to obferve them thro' Telefcopes. 

Of the Index, or moveable Ann of the Quadrant. 

I fhall conclude this Chapter in faying fomething concerning the Construction and Ufe of Fig. 9* 
this Index, which is no more than a moveable Index, with a Telefcope adjufted thereto, 
which produces the fame Effect as the Indexes of other Inftruments do ; that is, to make 
any Angle at pleafure with the Telefcope fixed to the Quadrant. The principal Part of this 
Index is an Iron or Brafs Ruler, drilled at one End, and is fo adjufted to the Central Cylin- 
der, of which we have already fpoken, that it has a circular Motion only. 

Upon this Ruler are fattened two Iron or Brafs Frames, in one of which, viz. that which 
is next to the Center of the Inftrument, the Object-Glafs is placed •, and in the other, the 
Eye-Glafs and Crofs-Hairs, which together make up a Telefcope, alike in every thing to 
the other fixed Telefcope of the Quadrant. 

At the End of the Index joining to the Limb, is a little Opening about the bignefs of a 
Degree of the Limb, thro' the Middle of which is ftrained a Hair, which is continued to the 
Center of the Quadrant. But becaufe in ufing the Index the laid Hair is fubject to divers 
Inconftancies of the Air, it is better to ufe a thin Piece of clear Horn, or a flat Glafs, ad- 
jufted to the aforefaid little Opening in a Frame, having a Right Line drawn upon that Sur- 
face thereof next to the Limb, fo that it tends ro the Center of the Inftrument, Note. The 
Frame is fattened in the little Opening by means of Screws. 

Now the Index being fattened to the Center before it is ufed, the Telefcope muft be proved, 
that fo it may be known whether the fixed Telefcope agrees therewith. To do which, having 
placed the Plane of the Inftrument horizontally, and directed the fixed Telefcope to fome 
Point of a vifible Object, diftant at leaft 500 Toifes ; afterwards the moveable Telefcope 
muft be pointed to the fame Object, that fo one of the Crofs-Hairs, viz. that which is 
perpendicular to the Plane of the Quadrant, may appear upon the aforefaid Point of the 
Object : for it matters not whether the Interferon of the Hairs appear thereon, or the per- 
pendicular Hair only. Then, if the Line drawn upon the Horn or Glafs on the Index falls 
upon the 90th Degree of the Limb of the Quadrant, the Telefcopes agree : if not, either 
the Horn or Glafs muft be removed 'till the Line drawn thereon falls upon the 90th Degree 
of the Divifions of the Limb, and then it muft be fattened to the Index •, or elfe regard 
muft be had, in all Obfervations, to the Difference between the firft Point of the Divifions 
of the Limb, and the Line drawn upon the faid Piece of Horn or Glafs,

CHAP. II. 

Of the Confti-uEtion and Ufe of the Micrometer. 

TH E Micrometer is an Inftrument of great Ufe in Aftronomy, and principally in meafunng p,g. ^ 
the apparent Diameters of the Planets, and taking fmall Diftances not exceeding a Degree, 
or Degree and a half. This Inftrument is compofed of two rectangular Brafs Frames, one 
of which, viz. ABCD, is commonly 2 \ Inches long, and 1 {- broad, having the Sides 

AB and 



i &lt;-6 *The ConjlruBion and Ufes Book VI. 

A B and C D, divided into equal Parts, about four Lines diftant from each other (for this 
is according to the Turns of the Screw, as fhall be hereafter explained), but in fuch manner, 
that the Lines drawn thro' each Divifion be perpendicular to the Sides A B and C D, and 
having human Hairs ffrained from Divifion to Divifion, iaftened with Wax to the 
Places 2, 2, £s?V. 

The other Frame E F G H, whofe Length E F is one Inch and a half, is fo adjufted to 
the former Frame, that the Sides E F and G H of the one, may move along the Sides A B 
and C D of the other, without being feparated therefrom •, which is done by means of 
Dove-tail Grooves. The Face of this fecond Frame next to the divided Face of the former, 
is likewife furnifhed with a Hair, (trained at the Place 4 ; fo that when the Frame is moving, 
the faid Hair may be always parallel to the Hairs on the other Frame. The Screw I, 
whofe Cylinder is about four or five Lines in Diameter, goes thro', and turns in the Side 
B D of one of the Frames, which lor this purpofe is made thicker than the other Sides. 
The End of this Screw is cut fo as to go through a round Hole made in the Side F PI of the 
leffer Frame, which for this purpofe is likewife made thicker than the other Sides ; there is 
alfo a little Pin K put thro' a Hole made in the End of the Screw, that fo the leffer Frame can 
no ways move, but in turning the Screw to the right or left, according as you would have 
the Frame move forwards or backwards. M N is a circular Plate about an Inch in Diameter, 
Faflened with two Screws to the Side B D of the Frame. This Plate is commonly divided in- 
to 20 of 60 equal Parts, which ferve to reckon the Revolutions and Parts of the Screw, by 
means of the Index M, which is adjufted under the Neck of the faid Screw, and turns with 
it. Now the Divifions of the Sides of the Frame A B C D, are made according to the 
Breadth of the Threads of the Screw •, for if, for example, the Divifions are defined to be 10 
Turns of the Screw diftant from each other, turn the laid Screw ten times about, and note 
how far the Frame hath moved : if it has moved four Lines, the Divifions mil ft be four Lines 
diftant from each other •, and fo of others. 

Now becaufe Hairs are fubject to divers Accidents by Heat, and otherwife, therefore M. de 
la Hire propofes a very thin and lmooth piece of Glafs to be 11 fed inftead of them, adjufted 
in Grooves made in the Sides of the Frame, and having very fine parallel Lines drawn there- 
on, which produce the fame Effect: as the parallel Hairs. All the Difficulty confifts in chufing 
a very fine and well polifhed Piece of Glafs, and drawing the Lines extremely nice ; for the 
Defaults will grofsly appear, when the faid Lines are perceived in a Telefcope. 

Note, Theie Lines muft be very lightly drawn upon the Glafs with a fmall Diamond, 
whofe Point is very fine. 

This Inftrument is joined to a Telefcope, by means of the prominent Pieces L, L, which 
(Vide in a Kind of parallelogramick Tin-Box, at the two Sides of which are two Circular 
Openings, wherein are foldered two fhort Tubes ; that on one Side being to receive the Tube 
carrying the Eye-Glafs ; and that on the other Side, the Tube carrying the Object-Glafs, fo 
that the Micrometer may be in the Focus of the faid Object-Glafs. 

Ufe of the Micrometer. 

In order to ufe this Inftrument, a lively Reprefentation of Objects appearing thro' the 
Telefcope muft be made in the Point whereat the parallel Flairs are placed ; therefore if the 
Object-Glafs be placed at it's Focal Diftance from the Micrometer, more or lefs, according 
to the Nature and Conftitution of the Eyes of the Obfervator, the Objects and the parallel 
Hairs will appear diftinctly in the faid Focus. 

If then the Focal Length of the Object-Glafs be meafured in Lines or 12th Parts of 
Inches, or, which is all one, the Diftance from the Center of the Object-Glafs to the parallel 
Hairs of the Micrometer, be meafured, this Diftance is to the Length of four Lines, which 
is the Interval between two fixed parallel Hairs nigheft each other, as Radius is to the Tan- 
gent of the Angle, fubtended by the two neareft parallel Hairs. This is evident from Diop- 
tricks : for the Diftance between the Object and the Obfervator's Eye, is fuppofed to be io 
great, that the focal Length of the Object-Glafs, compared therewith, is of no confequence ; 
fo that the Rays proceeding from the Points of the Object directly pafs thro' the Center of the 
Object-Glafs in the fame Manner, as tho' the Obfervator's Eye was placed in the faid Object- 
Glafs. This may be fhewn by Experience thus : 

Draw two black Lines parallel upon a very fmooth and white Board, whofe Interval let be 
fuch, that at the Diftance of 200 or 300 Toifes, they may be met with or embraced by two 
parallel Hairs of the Micrometer. This being done, remove the Table in a convenient Place 
(there being no Wind ftirring), fo far from the Telefcope, until the Lines drawn thereon, 
which muft be perpendicular to a Right Line drawn from the Table to the Micrometer, be 
catched by two fixed parallel Hairs of the Micrometer -, and then the Diftance between 
the Table and the Object-Glafs will have the fame Proportion to the Diftance between the 
Lines on the Board, as Radius is to the Tangent of the Angle fubtended by two Hairs of the 
Micrometer. 

Now move the Frame E F G H, by means of the Screw, 'till it's Hair exactly agrees with 
one of the parallel Flairs of the other Frame ; and when this is done, obferve the Situation 
of the Index of the Screw ; then turn the Screw until the faid I lair of the Frame E F G H 

agrees 



Chap. 2, of the Micrometer, 1^7 

agrees with the next neareft fixed Hair of the other Frame •, or, which is the fame thing, 
move the Frame EFGH the Length of four Lines, or one third of an Inch, which may 
be eafily known hy means of the Objcct-Glafs, which magnifies Objects, and count the 
Revolutions and Parts of the Screw, compieated in moving the faid Frame that Length. 
Finally, make a Table, ftiewing how many Revolutions, and Parts of a Revolution of the 
faid Screw, are anfwerable to every Minute and Second, by having the Angle fubtended bv 
the two black Lints on the Board given, and taking the Revolutions proportional to the 
Angles •, that is, if a certain Number of Revolutions give a certain Angle, half this 
!\'umber will give half the Angle, fcV. And this Proportion is exact enough in thefe fmall 
Angles. 

Now the Manner of taking the apparent Diameters of the Planets, is thus : Having di- 
!cchd the Telefcope, and it's Micrometer, towards a Planet, difpofe the Hairs, by the Mo- 
tion of the Telefcope, in fuch a Manner, that one of the fixed parallel Hairs do juft touch 
une Edge of the Planet, and turn the Screw 'till the moveable Hair juft touches the oppofite 
Edo-e of the faid Planet. Then, by means of the Table, you will know how many Minutes 
or Seconds correfpond to the Number of Revolutions or Parts, reckoning from the Point of 
the Plate over which the Index flood when the fixed Hair touched one Edge of the Planet, 
to the Point it frauds over when the moveable Hair touches the oppofite Edge ; and confe- 
ouently, the apparent Diameter of the. faid Planet will be had. And in this manner may 
fmall Angles on Earth be taken, which may be eafier done than thofe of the Celeftial Bodies, 
feecaufe of their Immobility. 

This Method is convenient enough for meafuring the apparent Diameters of the Planets, 
if the Body of any one of them moves between the parallel Hairs. Yet it ought to be ob- 
ferved, that the Sun and Moon's Diameters appear very unequal upon the account of Re- 
fraction ; for in fmall Elevations above the Horizon, by the Space of 30 Minutes, the verti- 
cal Diameters appear fomething leffer than they really are in the Horizon, and the hori- 
zontal Diameters cannot be found, unlefs with much Trouble, and feveral repeated Obferva- 
tions •, as likewife the Diftance between two Stars, or the Horns of the Moon, becaufe of 
their Diurnal Motions, which appear thro' the Telefcope very fwift. 

If two Stars of different Altitudes pafs by the Meridian at different Times, the Difference 
of their Altitudes will be the Difference of their Diftances from the Equator towards either 
of the Poles, which is called their Difference of Declination •, and by their Difference of Time 
in coming to the Meridian, the Difference of their Diftance from a determinate Point of the 
Equator, that is, the firft Degree of Aries will be had $ and this is their Difference of Right 
Afcenfion. 

If the two Stars are diftant from each other, we have Time enough, in the Interval of 
their PalTage by the Meridian and Micrometer, to finifh the Operations regarding the firft, 
before proceeding to thofe of the fecond ; but if they be very near each other, it is extremely 
difficult to make both the Obfervations at the fame Time, that fo the two Stars may be pre- 
cifely catched in the Meridian. But M. de la Hire fhews how to remedy this Inconveniency, 
by only ufing the common Micrometer : for the Obfervation of the PalTage of Stars be- 
tween, or upon the Hairs of the Micrometer, will give, by eafy Confequences, their Dif- 
ference of Right Aicenfion and Declination, without even fuppofing a Meridian known or 
drawn. 

But if the Difference of Declination and Right Afcenfion of two Stars that cannot be 
taken in between the Hairs of the Micrometer be required, this may be found in the follow- 
ing Manner. 

We adjuft a Crofs-Hair to the Micrometer, cutting the parallel ones at Right Angles, Fig. 10. 
which we fallen with Wax to the Middle of the Sides AC and B D. Then the Telefcope, 
and it's Micrometer, being fix(d in a convenient Pofitio.n, fo that the Stars may fucceffively 
pafs by the parallel Hairs, as the Stars A and S, in Figure 10 -, we obferve, by a fecond 
Pendulum Clock, the Time wherein the firft Star A touches the Point in which the afore- 
mentioned Crofs-Hair A S erodes fome one of the parallel Hairs, as A d. The Micrometer 
being difpofed for this Obfervation, which is not difficult to do, reckon the Seconds of 
Time elapfed between the Obfervations made in the Point A, and the arrival of the faid Star 
to the Point B, being the Concourfe of another parallel Hair BD. We likewife obferve the 
Time wherein the other Star S meets the Crofs-Hair at the Point S, and then at the Point 
D of the parallel Hair B D. Note, It is the fame thing if the Star S firft meets the parallel 
Hair in D, and afterwards the Crofs-Hair in S. 

Now as the Number of Seconds the Star A is moving through the Space A B, is to the 
Number of Seconds the Star S is moving through the Space SD; fo is the Diftance A C, 
known in Minutes and Seconds of a Degree in the Micrometer, to the Diftance C S, in 
Minutes and Seconds of a Degree. But the Horary Seconds of the Motion through the Space 
AB, muft be converted into Minutes and Seconds of a great Circle, by the Rule of Pro- 
portion. 

Having firft converted the Seconds of the Time of the faid Motion from A to B, which 
may be here citeemed as a Right Line, or an Arc of a great Circle, into Minutes and Se- 
conds of a Circle, in allowing 15 Minutes of a Circle to every Minute of an Hour, and 

S f the 



i r 8 The Conjlru&amp;ion a nd Ufes B o o k V I . 

the fame for Seconds : We fay, by the Rule of Proportion, As Radius is to the Sine Com- 
plement of the Stars known Declination, So is the Number of Seconds in the Arc A B 
alfo known, to the Number of Seconds of the fame Kind contained in the Arc C A, as an 
Arc of a great Circle. 

Moreover, in the Right-angled Triangle CAB, the Sides CA, and AB being given, as 
likewife the Right Angle at C, we find the Angle CAB; and i'uppofing CPR perpendi- 
cular to the Line A B, A B will be to C A as C A is to A P. 

But in the Right-angled Triangle CAP, we have (befides the Right Angle) the Angle 
A, as likewife the Side C A given ; therefore As Radius is to C A, So is the Sine of the 
An»le CAP, to C P. And as the Number of horary Seconds of the Motion from A 
to B, is to the horary Seconds in the Motion from S to D, fo is C P to C R. Then taking 
C R from C P, or elfe adding them together, according as AB or S D is next to the Point 
C, and we fliall have the Quantity of P R in parts of a great Circle, which will be the 
Difference of the two Stars Declinations. We have no regard here to the Difference of Mo- 
tion through the Spaces A B and S D, caufed by the Difference of Declination, bccaufe it is 
of no Confequence in the Difference of Declinations, as they are obferved by the Micro- 
meter. 

Finally, As A B is to A P, So is the Number of horary Seconds of the obferved Motion 
of the Star A through the Space A B, to the Number of Seconds of the Motion of the faid 
Star through the Space A P. Wherefore the Time when the Star A comes to P, will be 
known. But as the Number of Horary Seconds of the Motion through the Space A B is to 
the Number of Horary Seconds of the Motion through the Space S D ; So is the Number of 
Horary Seconds of the Motion through the Space A P, to the Number of Horary Seconds 
of the Motion through S R. 

Moreover ; The Time when the Star S is in S is known, to which if the Time of the 
Motion through S R be added, when A and S are on the fame Side the Point C, or fub- 
flracted if otherwife, and the Time when the Star is in R will be had. Now the Difference 
of Time between the Arrivals of the Stars in P and R, that is, the Difference of the Times 
wherein they come to the Meridian, will be the Difference of their Right Afcenfions, which 
by the Rule of Proportion may be reduced into Degrees and Minutes. Note, We have no 
regard here to the proper Motion of the Stars. 

From hence it is eafy to know how, inflead of the parallel Hair A B, to ufe another pa- 
rallel one, pafling thro' A, or any other, as alfo a moveable Parallel, provided that they form 
Similar Triangles, as will be eafily conceived by what hath been already faid. 

The aforefaid Operation may yet be done by another Method. For the parallel Hairs of 
the Micrometer being fo difpofed, that the firft of the Stars may move upon one of them ; 
and if the Time wherein the faid Star croffes the Crofs-Hair of the Micrometer be obferved, 
and if moreover the Time wherein the other Star croffes the faid Crofs-Hair be obferved, and 
at the fame Time the moveable parallel Hair be adjufted to the fecond Star, no ways altering 
the Micrometer •, we mail have, by means of the Diftance between that parallel Hair, the 
fitfb Star moved upon, and the moveable parallel Hair, the Diftance between two parallel 
Circles, to the Equator, palling thro' the Places of the faid Stars, which is their Difference 
of Declination. And if moreover, the Difference of the Times between the Paffages of 
each of the Stars by the Crofs-Hair of the Micrometer be converted into Minutes and 
Seconds of a Degree, the faid Stars afcenfional Difference will be had. This needs no 
Example. 

But if this be required between fome Star, and the Sun or Moon •, as for Example, 
Mercury moving under the Sun's Difk ; place the Micrometer fo, that the Limb of the Sun 
may move along one of the parallel Hairs, and obferve the Times when the Sun's antecedent 
and confequent Limbs, and the Center of Mercury, touch the Crofs-Hair ; then the Difference 
of Mercury's Declination, and the Sun's Limb, by means of the moveable Hair, will be had, 
the Micrometer remaining fixed. And if to the Time of the Obfervation of the Sun's an- 
tecedent Limb, half the Time elapfed between the Paffages of the antecedent and confequent 
Limb be added, we fliall have the Time of the Paffage of the Sun's Center by the Crofs-Hair 
of the Micrometer •, and by this means the Difference of the Times between the Paffage of 
the Sun's Center and Mercury over the Crofs-Hair, that is, by the Meridian, will be ob- 
tained. And this Difference of Time being converted into Degrees and Minutes, will give 
their afcenfional Difference. 

Moreover, fince the Sun's Center is in the Ecliptick, if in the fame Time as the faid Center 
paffes over the Crofs-Hair (the Sun's true Place being otherwife known), you feek in Ta- 
bles, the Angle of the Ecliptick with the Meridian, you will likewife have the Angle that 
Fig, , K the Ecliptick makes with the Sun's Parallel, as in Fig. 1 1. the Angle OCR, of the Ecliptick 

O C B, and of the Parallel to the Equator R C. Let P C be the Meridian, Mercury in M, 
the Center of the Sun in C, MR parallel to P C, and C R the Difference of Right Afcen- 
fion between the Center of the Sun C, and Mercury in M. Now the Minutes of the Dif- 
ference of the Right Afcenfion C R in the Parallel, being reduced to Minutes of a great Cir- 
cle, fay, As Radius is to the Sine Complement of the Sun's or Mercury' % Declination •, So is 
the Number of Seconds of the Difference of Right Afcenfion, to the Number of Seconds 

CR, 



Chap. 2. of the Micrometer. 159 

C K, as the Arc of a grea: Circle. Then in the Triangle CRT, Right-angled at R, we 
have the Side C R (now found) -, as alfo the Angle R C T, viz. the Difference between the 
pjcjht Angle, and the Angle made by the Ecliptick and Meridian •, whence the Hypothe- 
rmic C T, and the Side R T may be found. And if R T be taken from M R, which is the 
Difference of Declination of Mercury in M, and the Center of the Sun in C, there will re- 
main T M. Again, As C T is to T R, So is T M toTO; MO will be the Latitude of 
Mercury at the Time of Obfervation : And adding T O to the Side C T, we fhall have C O^ 
the Difference of Longitude between Mercury and the Sun's Center. Therefore the Sun's 
Lon°itude being known, that of Murcurys may alfo be found. 

If moreover, two or three Hours after the firft Obfervation of Mercury in M, the Diffe- 
rence of Declination and Right Afcenfion thereof be again obferved, when he is come to N, 
we fhall find, as before, N Q^the Latitude of Mercury, and C Q^the Difference of Longi- 
tude of him and the Sun's Center C ; whence the Place of the apparent Node of Mercury will 
be had. But note, The Point of Concourfe A, in the Right Line M N, with the Ecliptick 
CB, is not the Place of the faid Node, with regard to the Point C, becaufe between the 
Obfervations made in the Points M and N, the Sun by it's proper Motion is moved a few 
Minutes forwards, according to the Succeffion of Signs, which notwithstanding we have not 
regarded in the Obfervations. Therefore fay, As the Difference of the Latitudes M O 
and N Q^, to O Q^, minus the proper Motion of the Sun, between the Obfervations made in 
M and N •, So is MO to the Diftance O A, whence the true Diffance from the Sun's Center 
C to Mercury's Node A will be had. Note, The proper Motion of the Sun between the 
Obfervations muft be taken from O Q^, becaufe during that Time Mercury is re: ograde ; 
but if it's Motion had been direct, the Sun's Motion muft have been added to O Q^ 

In the Obfervations of Mercury's Paffage under the Sun's Difk, we have had no regard to 
the proper Motion of the Sun, as being of fmall confequence •, but if it is required to be 
brought into Confideration, C O and C Qjnuf!: be diminifhed by fo much of the Sun's pro- 
per Motion, as is performed in the Interval of Time between the Paffage of the Sun's Center 
and Mercury, by the Meridian. 

By the fame Method, the Diftances of Planets from each other, or from fixed Stars near 
the Ecliptick, may be obferved •, neverthelefs, excepting fome Minutes, not only upon the 
account of the proper Motions of the Stars, but alio becaufe of their Diftance from the 
Ecliptick or too great Latitude. Note, This fecond Method for finding the Difference of 
Declination and Right Afcenfion is not exacter than the former^ altho' it is performed with 
lefs Calculation : for it is fo difficult to difpofe the Hairs of the Micrometer according to 
the Parallel of the Diurnal Motion, that it cannot be done, but by feveral uncertain 
trials. 

M. de la Hire hath alfo invented another Micrometer, whofe ConftrucYion is eafy •, for it Fig. 12; 
is only a Pair of proportional Compalfes, whofe Legs on one Side, are, for Example, ten 
Times longer than thofe on the other Side. The fhorteft Legs of thefe Compaffes muft be 
put thro' a Slit made in the Tube of the Telefcope, and placed fo in the Focus of the Object- 
Glafs, that the two Points, which ought to be very fine, may be applied to all Objects re- 
prefented in the faid Focus. Then if the Angle fubtended by the i^iftance of two Objects 
in the Focus of the Object-Glafs be required to be found by means of thefe Compaffes, 
you muft fhut or open the two fhorteft Legs 'till their Points juft touch the Rcprefentations 
of the Objects ; and keeping the Compaffes to this Opening, if the longeft Legs be applied 
to the Divifions of a Scale, the Minutes and Seconds .contained in the Angle fubtended by 
the Diftance of the aforefaid Objects will be had. The Manner of dividing the faid Scale, 
is the fame as that for finding the Diftances of the parallel Hairs of the other Micrometer, 
in faying by the Rule of Proportion, As the Number of Lines contained in the Focal Length 
of the Object-Glafs, is to one Line ; So is Radius to the Tangent of the Angle fubtended 
by one Line in the Focus : therefore if the longeft Legs be ten Times longer than the others, 
ten Lines on the Scale will meafure the faid Angle fubtended by one Line, which being 
known, it will be eafy to divide the Scale for Minutes and Seconds. 

This Micrometer may be ufed for taking the apparent Diameters of the Planets •, as alfo 
to take the Diftances of fixed Stars which are near each other, and meafure fmall Diftances 
on Earth. 



CHAP. III. 

Of making Celeflial Obfervations. 

OBfervations of the Sun, Stars, 62V. made in the Day-Time with long Telefcopes, are 
eafy, becaufe the Crofs-Hairs in the Focus of the Object-Glafs may then be diftinctly 
perceived ; but in the Night the faid Crofs-Hairs muft be enlightened with a Link, or 

* Candle,

Candle, that fo one may fee them with the Stars, thro' the Telefcope: and this is cone two 
ways. 

Firft, We enlighten the Object-Glafs of the Telefcope, in obliquely bringing a Candle 
near to it, that fo it's Smoke or Body do not hinder the Progrefs of the Rays coining from 
the Star. But if the Object-Glafs be fomcthing deep in the Tube, it cannot fufficicntly be 
enlightened, without the Candle's being very near it, and this hinders the Sight of the 
Star •, and if the Telefcope is above fix Feet long, it will be difficult fufficiently to enlighten 
the Object-Glafs, that fo the crofs Hairs be diftin6tly perceived. 

Secondly, We make a fuffkient Opening in tne Tube of the Telefcope near the Focus 
of the Object-Glafs, thro' which we enlighten with a Candle the crofs Hairs placed in the 
Focus. 

But this Method is fubject to feveral Inconveniences, for the Light being fo near the 
Obfervator's Eyes, he is otten incommoded thereby. And moreover, fince the crofs Hairs 
are by that Opening uncovered and txpofed to the Air, they lofe their Situation, become 
flack, or may be broken. 

Befides this, the faid fecond Method is liable to an Inconveniency for which it ought to 
be entirely neglected ; and that is, that it is iubject to an Error, which is, that according to 
the Pofition of the Light illuminating the crofs Hairs, the faid Hairs will appear in different 
Situations : becaufe, for Example, when the Horizontal Hair is enlightened above, we per- 
ceive a luminous Line, which may be taken for the faid Hair, and which appears at it's 
upper Superficies. And contrariwife, when the faid Hair is enlightened underneath, the lu- 
minous Line will appear at it's lower Superficies, the Hair not being moved ; and this Error 
will be the Diameter of the Hair, which often amounts to more than fix Seconds. But M. 
de la Hire hath found a Remedy for this Inconveniency. For he often found, in Obferva- 
tions made in Moonfhine Nights, in Weather a little foggy, that the crofs Hairs were di- 
flinctly perceived \ whereas, when the Heavens were ferene, they could fcarcely be feen : 
whence he bethought himfelf to cover that End of the Tube next to the Object-Glafs with 
a Piece of Gawze, or very fine white filken Crape ; which fucceeded fo well, that a Link 
placed at a good Diftance from the Telefcope fo enlightened the Crape, that the crofs Hairs 
diftinctly appeared, and the Sight of the Stars was no way obfeured. 

Solar Obfervations cannot be made without placing a fmoked Glafs between the Telefcope 
and the Eye, which may thus be prepared. Take two equal and well poli (Tied round Pieces 
of flat Glafs, upon the Surface of one of which, all round it's Limb, glew a Pafteboard 
Ring •, then put the other Piece of Glafs into the Smoke of a Link, taking it feveral times 
out, and putting it in again, for fear left the Heat of the Link fhould break it, until the 
Smoke be fo thick thereon, that the Link can fcarcely be feen thro' it : but the Smoke muft 
not be all over it of the fame Thicknefs, that fo that Place thereof may be chofen anfwering 
to the Sun's Splendor. This being done, this Glafs thus blackened, muft be glewed to the 
before-mentioned Pafteboard Ring, with it's blackened Side next to the other Glafs, that fo 
the Smoke may not be rubbed off. 

Note, When the Sun's Altitude is obferved thro' a Telefcope, confiding of but two 
Gtaffes, it's upper Limb will appear as tho' it were the lower one. 

There are two principal Kinds of Obfervations of Stars, the one being when they are in 
the Meridian, and the other when they are in vertical Circles. 

If the Pofition of the Meridian be known, and then the Plane of the Quadrant be placed 
in the Meridian Circle, by means of the plumb Line fufpended at the Center, the Meridian 
Altitudes of Stars may be eafily taken, which are the principal Operations, ferving as a 
Foundation to the whole Art of Aftronomy. The Meridian Altitude of a Star may likewife 
be had by means of a Pendulum Clock, if the exact Time of the Star's Paffage by the Me- 
ridian be known. Now it muft be obferved, that Stars have the fame Altitude during a 
Minute before and after their Paffage by the Meridian, if they be not in or near the Zenith ; 
but if they be, their Altitudes muft be taken every Minute, when they are near the Meridian, 
which we fuppofe already known, and then their greateft or lead Altitudes will be the Me- 
ridian Altitudes fought. 

As to the Obfervations made without the Meridian in Vertical Circles, the Pofition of a 
given Vertical Circle muft be known, or found by the following Method. 

Firft, The Quadrant and it's Telefcope remaining in the fame Situation wherein it was 
when the Altitude of a Star, together with the Time of it's Paffage by the Interfection of 
the crofs Hairs in the Focus of the Object-Glafs, was taken, we obferve the Time when 
the Sun, or fome fixed Star, whole Latitude and Longitude is known, arrives to the Verti- 
cal Hair in the Telefcope ; and from thence the Pofition of the faid Vertical Circle will be 
had, and alfo the obferved Star's true Place. 

But if the Sun, or fome other Star, does not pafs by the Mouth of the Tube of the 
Telefcope, and if a Meridian Line be otherwife well drawn upon a Fioor, or very level 
Ground, in the Place of Obfervation, you muft fufpend a Plumb-Line to fome fixed Place, 
aboii-: three or four Toifes diftant from the Quadrant, under which upon the Floor muft a 
Mark be made in a right Line with the Plumb-Line. This being done, you muft put a 
thin Piece of Brafs, or Pafteboard, very near the Object-Glafs, in the Middle of which there 

is 



Chap. 3. Of making Cekftial Obfervations. 161 

is a fmall Slit vertically placed, and paffing thro' the Center of the Circular Figure of the 
Object-Glafs. Now by means of this Slit, the beforementioned Plumb-Line may be per- 
ceived thro' the Telefcope, which before could not be feen, becaufe of its Nearnefs thereto. 
Then the Plumb-Line muft be removed and fufpended, fo that it be perceived in a right 
Line with a vertical Hair in the Focus of the Object-Glafs, and a Point marked on the 
Floor directly under it. And if a right Line be drawn thro this Point, and that marked 
under the Plumb-Line before it was removed, the laid Line will meet the Meridian drawn 
upon the Floor; and fo we fhall have the Pofition of the vertical Circle the obferved Scar is 
in with refpect to the Meridian, the Angle whereof may be meafured in afluming known 
Lengths upon the two Lines Irom the Point of Concourfe ; for if thro' the Extremities of 
th-fe known Lengths, a Line or Bafe be drawn, we fhall have a Triangle, whole three 
Sides being known, the Angle at the Vertex may be found, which will be the Angle made 
by the Vertical Circle and Meridian. 

The Manner of taking the Meridian Altitudes of Star's. 

It is very difficult to place the Plane of the Quadrant in the Meridian exactly enough 
to take Meridian Altitude of a Star ; for unlefs there be a convenient Place and a Wall, 
where the Quadrant may be firmly fattened in the Plane of the Meridian, which is very 
difficult to do, we fhall not have the true Pofition of the Meridian, proper to obferve all 
the Stars, as we have mentioned already. Therefore it will be much eafier, and principally 
in Journeys, to ufe a portable Quadrant, by means of which the Altitude of a Star muft 
be obferved a little before its Paffage over the Meridian, every Minute, if poffible, until its 
greateft or haft Altitude be had. Now, tho' by this means we have not the true Pofition 
of the Meridian, yet we have the apparent Meridian Altitude of the Star. 

Altho' this Method is very good, and free from any fenfible Error, yet if a Star paries 
by the Meridian near the Zenith, we cannot have its Meridian Altitude, by repeated Obler- 
vations every Minute, unlefs by chance ; becaufe in every Minute of an Hour the Altitude aug- 
ments about fifteen Minutes of a Degree : and in thefe kind of Obfervations, the inconvenient 
Situation of the Obfervator, the Variation of the Star's Azimuth feveral Degrees in a little 
time, the Alteration that the Inltrument muft have, and the Difficulty in well replacing it 
vertically again, hinders our making of Obfervations oftner than in every fourth Minute of 
an Hour; during which Time the Difference in the Star's Altitude will be One Degree. 
Therefore in thefe Cafes it will be better to have the true Pofition of the Meridian, or the 
exact Time a Star paffes by the Meridian, in order to place tne Inltrument in the laid Me- 
ridian, or move it fo that one may obferve the Altitude of the Star the Moment it pafles by 
the Meridian. 

Of Refractions. 

The Meridian Altitudes of two fixed Stars, which are equal, or a fmall matter different, 
the one being North, and the other South, being obferved, and alfo their Declination 
otherwife given •, to find the Refraction anfwering to the Degrees of Altitude of tne faid 
Stars, and the true Height of the Pole, or Equator, above the Place of Obfervation. 

Having found the apparent Meridian Altitude of fome Star near the Pole (by the afore- 
going Directions; if the Complement of the faid Star's Declination be added thereto, or 
taken therefrom, we fhall have the apparent Height of the Pole. After the fame manner 
may alfo the apparent Height of the Equator be found, by means of the Meridian Altitude 
of fome Star near the Equator, in adding or fubftracting its Declination. 

Then thefe Heights of the Pole and Equator being added together, their Sum will al- 
ways be greater than a Quadrant ; but 90 Degrees being taken from this Sum, the 
Remainder will be double the Refraction of either of the Stars obferved at the fame height : 
and therefore taking the faid Refraction from the faid apparent Height of the Pole, or 
Equator, we fhail have their true Altitude. 

Example. 

Let the Meridian Altitude of a Star obferved below the North Pole, be 30 Deg. 15 Mim 
and the Complement of its Declination 5 deg. whence the apparent Height of the Pole will 
be 35 Deg. 15 Min. Alfo let the apparent Meridian Altitude of fome other Star, obferved 
near the Equator, be 30 Deg. 40 Min. and its Declination 40 Deg. 9 Min. whence the appa- 
rent Height of the Equator will be 54 Deg. 49 Min. Therefore the Sum of the Heights of 
the Pole and Equator thus found, will be 90 Deg. 4 Min. from which fubftracting.90 Deg. 
and there remains 4 Min. which is double the Refraction at 30 Deg. 28 Min. of Altitude, 
which is about the middle between the Heights found : therefore at the Altitude of ^o 
Deg. 15 Min. the Refraction will be fomething above 2 Min. viz. 2 Min. 1 See. and at the 
Altitude of 30 Deg. 40 Min. the Refraction will be 1 Min. 59 Sec. 

Laftly, If 2 Min. 1 Sec. be taken from the apparent Height of the Pole 25 Min. 15 Sec 
the Remainder 35 Deg. 12 Min. 59 Sec. will be the true Height of the E J ole; and fo the true 
Height of the Equator will be 54 Deg. 47 Min. 1 Sec. as being the Complement of the 
Height of the Pole to 90 deg. 

T t Note, 



1 6 1 Of making Celeftial Obfervations, B o o k V I . 

Tfote, The Refraction and Height of the Pole found according to this way, will be fo 
much the more exact, as the Altitude of the Stars is greater -, for if the Difference of the 
Altitudes of each Star mould be even 2 Deg. when their Altitudes are above 30 Deg. we 
may by this Method have the Refraction, and the true Height of the Pole, becaufe in this 
Cafe the Difference of Refraction in Altitudes differing two Degrees, is not fenfible. 

Another Way of obferving Refraclions. 

The Quantity of Refraction may alfo be found by the Obfervations of one Star only, 
whofe Meridian Altitude is 90 Deg. or a little lefs ; for the Height of the Pole or Equator 
above the Place of Obfervation being otherwife known, we fhall have the Star's true De- 
clination, by it's Meridian Altitude •, becaufe Refractions near the Zenith are infenfibie. 

Now if we obferve by a Pendulum the exact Times when the faid atar comes to every 
Degree of Altitude, as alfo the Time of it's Paffage by the Meridian, which may be known 
by the equal Altitudes of the Star being Eaft and Weft, we have three things given in a 
fpherical Triangle, viz. the Diftance between the Pole and Zenith, the Complement of the 
Star's Declination, and the Angle comprehended by the aforefaid Arcs ; namely, the Diffe- 
rence of mean Time between the Paffage of the Star by the Meridian and it's Place, con- 
verted into Degrees and Minutes"-, to which muff, be added, the convenable proportional 
Part of the mean Motion of the Sun in the Proportion of 59 Min. 8 Sec. per Day : therefore 
the true Arc of the Vertical Circle between the Zenith and the true Place of the Star may be 
found. 

But the apparent Arc of the Altitude of the Star is had by Obfervation, and the Diffe- 
rence of thefe Arcs will be the Quantity of Refraction at the Height of the Star. By a like 
Calculation the Refraction of every Degree of Altitude may be found. 

The fame may be done by means of the Sun, or any other Star, provided it's Declination 
be known, to the End that at the Time of Obfervation the true Diftance of the Sun or Star 
from the Zenith may be found. 

The Refractions of Stars being known, it will then be eafy to find the Height of the 
Pole ; for having obferved the Meridian Altitude of the Polar Star, as well above as below 
the Pole, the fame Day, and having diminifhed each Altitude by it's proper Refraction, half 
of the Difference of the corrected Altitudes, added to the leffer Altitude corrected, or fub- 
ftracted from the greater Altitude thus corrected, will give the true Height of the Pole. 

M. de la Hire has obferved with great Care for feveral Years the Meridian Altitudes of 
fixed Stars, and principally of Sirius, and Lucida Lyra, with Aflronomical Quadrants very 
well divided, and very good Telefcopes at different Hours of the Day and Night, and at dif- 
ferent Seaibns of the Year ; and he affures us, that he never found any Difference in the;r 
Altitudes, but what proceeded from their proper Motion. 

And becaufe Sirius comes to about the 26th Degree of the Meridian, we might doubt 
whether in the leffer Altitudes the Refractions in the Winter would be greater than thofe 
in the Summer •, hence he alfo obferved, with the late M. Picard, the leffer Meridian Alti- 
tudes of the Star Capella, which is about 4 - t Degrees at feveral different Times of the 
Year. 

Having compared thefe different Obfervations together, and made the neceffarv Reduc- 
tions, becaufe of the proper Motion of that Star, there was fcarcely found one Minute of 
Difference, that could proceed from any other Caufe but Refraction. Therefore he made 
but one Table of the Refraction of the Sun, Moon, and the Stars, for all Times of the 
Year, conformable to the Obfervations that he made from them. 

Notwithftanding this, one would think that Refractions nigh the Horizon are fubject to 
divers Inconftancies, according to the Conltitution of the Air, and the Nature of high or 
low Grounds, as M. de la Hire has often found ; for obferving the Meridian Altitudes of 
Stars at the Foot of a Mountain, which feemed to be even with the Top of it, they appeared 
to him a little higher, than if he had obferved them at the Top : But if the Obfervations of 
others may be depended upon, Refractions are greater, even in Summer, in the frozen 
Zones, than in the temperate Zones. 

How to find the Time of the Equinox and Sol/lice by Obfervation. 

Having found the Height of the Equator, the Refraction and the Sun's Parallax at the fame 
Altitude, it will not afterwards be difficult to find the Time in which the Center of the Sun 
is in the Equator-, for if from the apparent Meridian Altitude of the Center of the Sun, the 
fame Dav as it comes to the Equinox, be taken the convenient Refraction, and then the 
Parallax be added thereto, the true Meridian Altitude of the Sun's Center will be had. 
Now the Difference of this Altitude, and the Height of the Equinoctial, will fhew the 
Time of the true Equinox before or after Noon : and if the Sum of the Seconds of that 
Difference be divided by 59, the Quotient will fhew the Hours and Fractions which 
muft be added or fubftracted from the true Hour of Noon, to have the Time of the true 
Equinox. 

The Hours of the Quotient muft be added to the Time of Noon, if the Meridian Altitude 
of the Sun be leffer than the Height of the Equator about the Time of the vernal Equinox -, 

but 



Chap. 3. Of making Cekftial Obfervations . 

but they muft be fub ft rafted, if it be found greater. You muft proceed contrariwife, when 
the Sun is near the autumnal Equinox. 

Example. The true Height 41 Deg. 10 Min. of the Equator being given, and having ob- 
ferved the true Meridian Altitude 41 Deg. 5 Min. 15 Sec. of the Sun, found by the apparent 
Altitude of it's upper or lower Limb, corrected by it's Semidiameter, Refraction, and Pa- 
rallax, and the Difference wili be 4 Min. 45 Sec. or 285 Seconds, which being divided by 59, 
the Quotient will be 4 ; 9 -, that is, 4 Hours 48 Minutes, which muft be added to Noon, 
if the Sun be in the vernal Equinox, and confequently the Time of the Equinox will happen 
4 Hours 48 Minutes after Noon. But if the Sun was in the autumnal Equinox, the Time 
of the laid Equinox would happen 4 Flours 48 Minutes before Noon, that is, at 12 Minutes 
pad S'~.'vcn in the Morning. 

As to the Solftices, there is much more Difficulty in determining them than the Equi- 
noxes, lor one Obfervation only is not fufficient •, becaufe about this Time the Difference be- 
tween the Meridian Altitudes in one Day, and the next fucceeding Day, is almoft infen- 
fible. 

Now the exact Meridian Altitude of the Sun muft be taken, 12 or 15 Days before the 
Solftice, and as many after, that fo one may find tne fame Meridian Altitude by little and 
little ; to the End that by the proportional Farts of the alteration of the Sun's Meridian Al- 
titude, we may more exactly find the Time wherein the Sun is found at the fame Altitude, 
before and after the Solftice, being in the fame Parallel to the Equator. 

Now having found the Time elapfed between both the Situations of the Sun, you muft; 
take half of it, and feek in the Tables the true Place of the Sun at thefe three Times. 
This being clone, the Difference of the extreme Places of the Sun muft be added to the 
mean Place, in order to have the mean Place with Comparifon to the Extremes •, but if the 
mean Place found by Calculation, does not agree with the mean Place found by Comparifon, 
you aiuft take the Difference, and add to the mean Time, the Time anfwering to that Dif- 
ference, if the mean Time found by Calculation be lcffer ; but contrariwife, it muft be fub- 
ftrafted if it be greater, in order to have the Time of the Solftice. 

Example. The laft Day of May, the apparent Meridian Altitude of the Sun was found at 
the Royal Obfervatory, 64 Dtg. 47 Min. 25 Sec. and the 22d Day of June following, the 
apparent Meridian Altitude was found 64 Deg. 28 Min. 15 Sec. from whence we know, by 
having the Difference of Declination at thofe Times, that the Sun came to the Parallel of the 
firft Obfervation, the 22c! of June, at 4 Hours 12 Minutes in the Morning; and confe- 
quently the mean Time between the Obfervations, was on the 2 2d of June, at 2 Hours 6 
Minutes in the Morning. 

Now by Tables, the true Place of the Sun at the Time of the firft Obfervation, was 2 
Signs 18 Deg. 5S Min. 23 Sec. and at the Time of the laft it was 3 Signs, 11 Deg. 4 Min. 
52 Sec. and :ii the middle Time 3 Signs, 1 Min. 56 Sec. But the Difference of the two ex- 
treme Places is 22 Deg. 6 Min. 29 Sec. half of which is 1 1 Deg. 3 Min 15 Sec. which added 
to the mean Place, makes 3 Signs, 1 Min. 38 Sec. which is the mean Place with comparifon 
to the Extremes. Again, The Difference between the mean Place, by Calculation 3 Signs, 
1 Min. 56 Sec. and the mean Place by Comparifon, is 18 Seconds, which anfwers to 7 Min. 
18 Sec. of Time, which muft be taken from the mean Time, becaufe the mean Place by Cal- 
culation is greater than the mean Place by Comparifon. Therefore the Time of the Solftice 
was the nth of June, at 1 Hour, 58 Min. 18 Sec. in the Morning. 

Note, The Error of a few Seconds, in the obferved Altitude of the Sun, will caufe an 
alteration of an Hour in the true Time of the Solftice •, as in the propofed Example, 10 Se- 
conds, or thereabouts, in Altitude, will caufe an Error of an Hour-, whence the true Time 
of the Solftice cannot be had but with Inftruments well divided, and feveral very exact Ob- 
fervations.

Obfervations of the Polar Star. 
By divers Obfervations of the greateft and leaft apparent Meridian Altitudes of the Polar 
Star, which is in the end of the Tail of the Little Bear, it is concluded that the apparent 
Altitude of the Pole, as M. Picardhis denoted it in his Book ot the Dimenfions of the Earth, 
between St James's and St Martin's Gates (about S. Jaq.ues de la Boucherie, at Paris) 
is 48 Deg. 52 Min. 20 Sec.

apparent Height of the Pole at the Royal Obfervatory will be 

The Convenable Refraction to that Height _____ 

Then the true Height of the Pole at the Obfervatory.

And confequently the Height of the Equator will be 

The true or apparent Time in which a Planet or fixed Star pajfes by the Meridian, being given, to 
find the difference of Right Afcenfion between the fixed Star, or Planet, and the Sun. 

The given Time from Noon to or from the time of the PafTage of the Star or Planet by 
the Meridian, muft be converted into Degrees, and what is required will be anfwered. 

Example. Jupiter pafied by the Meridian at 10 Hours, 23 Min. 15 Sec. in the Morning, 
whofe Diftance in time from Noon, which is 1 Hour, 36 Min. 45 Sec. being converted into 
Degrees of the Equator, will give 24 Deg. 11 Min. 15 Sec. for the Difference of PJght 
Afcenfion between the Sun and Jupiter, in that Moment the Center of Jupiter pafied by the 
Meridian. 

In this, and the following Problem, we have propofed the true or apparent Time, and 
not the mean Time; becaufe the true Time is eafur to know by Obfervations of the Sun, 
than the mean Time. We fliall explain what is meant by mean Time, as likewife true or 
apparent Time, in the next Chapter. 

The true Time between the Paffages of two fixed Stars by the Meridian being given, or elfe of a 
fixed Star and a Planet, to find their Afcenfional Difference. 

The given Time between their Pafiages by the Meridian muft be converted into Degrees 
of the Equator, and the Right Afcenfion of the true Motion of the Sun anfwering to that 
time, mull be added thereto ; then the Sum will be the Afcenfional Difference fought. 

Example. Suppofe between the Pafiages of the Great Tog, called Sirius, by the Meridian, 
and the Heart of the Lion named Regulus, there is elapfed 3 Hours, 20 Min. of time&gt; and 
the Right Afcenfion of the true Motion of the Sun, let be 7 Min. ■$$ Sec. 

Whence converting 3 Hours, 20 Min. into Degrees of the Equator, and there will be 
had 50 Deg. to which adding 7 Min. 2,5 Sec. and the Sum 50 Deg. 7 Min. 05 Sec. will be 
the Afcenfional Difference between Sirius and Regulus. 

You muft proceed thus for the Afcenfional Difference of a fixed Star and a Planet, or of 
two Planets ; yet note, if the proper Motion of the Planet or Planets be confiderable be- 
tween both their Pafiages by the Meridian, regard muft be had thereto. 

How to obferve Eclipfes. 

Amongft the Obfervations of Eclipfes, we have the Beginning, the End, and the Total Emer- 
fion, which may exactly enough be eftimated by the naked Eye, without Teiefcopes, except 
the Beginning and the End of Eclipfes of the Moon, where an Error of one or two Minutes 
may be made, becaufe it is difficult certainly to determine the Extremity of the Shadow. 
But the Quantity of the Eclipfe, that is, the eclipfed Portion of the Sun and Moon's Difk, 
which is meafured by Digits, or the 12th parts of the Sun and Moon's Diameter, and Mi- 
nutes, or the 60th parts of Digits, cannot be well known without a Telefcope joined to 
fome Inftrument. For an Eftimation made with the naked Eye is very fubject to Error, as 
it is eafy to fee in the Hiftory of ancient Eclipfes, altho they were obferved by very able 
Aftronomers. 

The Aftronomers who firft ufed Teiefcopes furnifhed with but two Glafies, namely, a 
Convex Object-Glafs, and a Concave Eye-Glafs, in the Obfervations of Eclipfes, obferved 
thofe of the Sun in the following manner. They caufed a hole to be made in the Window- 
fhutter of a Room, which Room in the Day-time, when the Shutters were fluit, was 
darkened thereby ; thro' which Hole they put the Tube of a Telefcope, in fuch manner, 
that the Rays of the Sun, paffing thorough the Tube, might be received upon a white 

* piece 



Chap. 3. Of making Celeftial Obfervations 16^ 

piece of Paper, or a Table-Cloth, upon which was firft defcribed a Circle of a convenable 
bi^nefs, with five other Concentric Circles, equally diftant from one another, which, with 
the Center, divided a Diameter of the outward Circle into 12 equal Parts. Then having 
ati jutted the Table-Cloth perpendicular to the Situation of the Tube of the Telefcope, the lu- 
minous Image of the Sun was caft upon the Table-Cloth, which would full be greater ac- 
cording as the Table-Cloth was more diftant from the Eye-Glafs of the Telefcope •, whence 
by moving the Tube forwards and backwards, they found a Place where the Image of the 
Sun appeared exactly equal to the outward Circle, and at that Diftance they fixed the Table- 
Cloth, with the Tube of the Telefcope, which compofed the Inftrument for the faid Ob- 
fervation. Afterwards they moved the Tube according to the Sun's Motion, to the End that 
the luminous Limb of it's Pifk might every where touch the outward Circle defcribed upon 
the Table-Cloth, by which means the Quantity of the eclipfed Portion was feen, and it's 
created: Obfcurity meafured by the Concentric Circles j they denoted the Hour of every 
Phafe, by a Second Pendulum Clock, rectified and prepared for that purpofe. The fame 
Method is ftill obferved by many Aftronomers, who ufe alfo a Circular Reticulum, made 
with fix Concentric Circles upon very fine Paper, which mull be oiled, to rencer the Sun's 
linage more feniible. The greateft of the Circles ought exactly to contain the Image of the 
Sun in the Focus of the Object-Glafs of a Telefcope of 40 or 60 Feet; the fix Circles are 
equally diftant, and divide the Diameter of the Sun in twelve equal digits. When the Faper 
is placed in the Focus of a great Telefcope, the enlightened part of the Sun will very di- 
ftinctly be feen •, then the Eye-Glafs is not ufed. 

There are others who ufe a Telefcope furnifhed with two Convex-Glafles, from whence 
the fame Effect; follows. But altho' the Ufe of a Telefcope in this manner be very proper to 
obferve Eclipfes of the Sun, yet it is not fit to obferve Eclipfcs of the Moon, becaufc it's 
Li ff ht is not ftrong enough. Laftly, Others place a Micrometer in the common Focus of 
the Convex Lenfes. Befides the Quantity of the Phafes of the Eclipfes of the- Sun and Moon 
(eafily known by the faid Micrometer), we may have the Diameters of the Luminaries, and 
the Proportion of the Earth's Diameter to the Moon's, as well by the obfcure Protion of it's 
Difk, as by the luminous Portion and the Diftance between it's Horns. 

The Method of obferving Eclipfes by means of the Micrometer will be much better, if 
the Divifions to which the parallel Hairs are applied be made fo, that ;'.x Int :vals of the 
Hairs, may contain the Diameter of the Sun or Moon. For the moveable Hair pofited in 
the Middle of the Diftance between the immoveable ones (which is not difficult to do), will 
fhew the Digits of the Eclipfe. 

The fame Telefcope and Micrometer may ferve for all the other Obfervations, and to 
meafure Eclipfes •, as, to obferve the Paffage of the Earth's Shadow over the Spots of the 
Moon, in Lunar Eclipfes. 

There yet remains one confiderable Difficulty, and that is, to make a new Divifion. 
of the Micrometer ferving as a common Reticulum for all Obfervations •, for it fcarcely hap- 
pens in an Age in two Eclipfes, that the apparent Diameters of the Sun and Moon are the 
fame. 

Therefore M. de la Hire has invented a new Reticulum, which having all the Ufes of the 
Micrometer, may fer/e to obferve all Eclipfes, it being adapted to all apparent Diameters 
of the Sun and Moon, and it's Divifions are firm and folid enough to refift all the Viciflltudes 
of the Air, altho' they are as fine as Hairs. 

The Conftruction and Ufe of this Reticulum is thus : Firft, Take two Object Lenfes of 
Telefcopes of the fame Focus, or nighly the fame, which join together. As for Example, 
The Focus of two Lenfes together of eight Feet, which is the fit Length of a Telefcope for 
obferving Eclipfes, unlefs the Beginning and the End of Solar ones, which require a longer 
Telefcope exactly to determine them. 

Secondly, We find from Tables, that the greateft Diameter of the Moon at the Altitude 
of 90 Deg. is 34 Min. 6 Sec. To which adding 10 Sec. and there will arife 34 Min. 16 
Sec. Therefore fay, As Radius is to the Tangent of 17 Min. 8 Sec. (the half of 34 Min. 16 
Sec.) So is 8 Feet, or the focal Length of the two Lenfes to the Parts of a Foot, which dou- 
bled will fubtend an Angle of 34 Min. 16 Sec. in the Focus of the Telefcope, and this will 
be the Diameter of the faid Circular Reticulum. 

Thirdly, Upon a very flat, clear, and well polifhed Piece of Glafs, defcribe lightly with 
the Point of a Diamond, faftened to one of the Legs of a Pair of Compalfes, fix Concentric 
Circles, equally diftant from each other. The Semidiameter of the greateft and laft let be 
equal to the fourth Term before found. Likewife draw two Diameters to the greateft Circic 
at Right Angles. The fiat Piece of Glafs being thus prepared and put into the Tube, of 
which we have before fpoken, and in the Focus of the Telefcope, will be a very proper 
Reticulum for obferving Solar and Lunar Eclipfes, and it will divide all the apparent Dia- 
meters into twelve equal Parts or Digits, as we are now going to explain. 

It is manifefl: from Dioptricks, that all Rays coming from Points of a diftant Object:, after 
their Refraction by t\v*o convex Lenfes, either joined or ibmething diftant from each other, 
will be painted in the common Focus of the faid Lenfes, which mil appear fo much the 
greater, according as the Lenfes be diftant from one another ; 10 that they will appear the 

U u fmalleft

fmallelt when the Lenfes are joined together. Therefore if the Objecl-Glafles ufed in this 
Conftruction, be each put into a Tube, and one of thefe Tubes Aides within the other; 
then the faid Lenfes being thus joined, the Image of adiftant Object, whofe Rays fall upon 
the Lenfes under an Angle of 34 Min. 16 Sec. will exceed the Moon's greateft apparent 
Diameter by 10 Sec. Therefore in moving the Lenfes by little and little, fuch a Pofition may 
be found, wherein the Diameter of the greateft Circle on the Reticulum pofited in the Fo- 
cus, will anfwer to an Angle of 34 Min. 16 Sec. For the Image ot an Object perceived 
under a lefs Angle, may be equal to the Image of the fame Object perceived under a greater 
Angle, according to the different Lengths of the Foci. But the Reticulum is in a feparate 
Tube, and fo it may be removed at a Diftance at pleafure from the Object-Glaffes. We 
now proceed to lay down two different Ways of finding the Pofitions of [the Lenies and 
Reticulum, proper to receive the different Diameters of the Sun and Moon. 

Firft, In a very level and proper Place for making Obfervations with GlafTes, place a 
Board, with a Sheet of Paper thereon, directly expofed to the Tube's Length, having two 
black Lines drawn upon it parallel to each other, and at fuch a Diftance trom each other, 
that it fubtends an Angle of 34 Min. 6 Sec. fo that the Diftance of the faid two Lines, 
reprefented iu the Focus of the Object-GlafTts, may likewife fubtend an Angle of 34 Min. 
6 Sec. And this may be found in reafoning thus, (as we have already done for the Micro- 
meter). As Radius is to the Tangent of 17 Min. 3 Sec. So is the Diftance from the Tube of 
the Object-Glaffes to the Broad, To half the Diftance that the parallel Lines on the 
Paper muft be at. And thus we mail find by Experience the Place of each Object-Glafs, 
and the Reticulum in the common Focus, in fuch manner that the Reprefentation of the 
two black Lines on the Paper, embraces entirely the Diameter of the greateft Circle of 
the faid Reticulum. Now we fet down 34 Min. 6 Sec. upon the Tubes, in each Pofition 
of the Lenfes and their Foci, or the Reticulum, that fo the Lenfes and Reticulum may be 
adjufted to their exact Diftance, every time an Angle of 34 Deg. 6 Min. is made ufe of. 

Again, Let the faid Board and white Paper be placed further from the Tube, in fuch 
manner, that the Diftance between the parallel Lines on the Paper fubtend, or is the Bafe 
of an Angle of 33 Min. for example, whofe Vertex is at the Lenfes of the Telefcope : which 
may be done, in faying, As the Targent of 16 Min. 30 Sec. is to Radius •, So is half the 
Interval of the parallel Lines on the Paper, To the Diftance of the Board from the Lenfes. 
Now in this Pofition of the Telefcope and Board, the Pofition of the Lenfes and Reticulum 
between themfelves muft be found ; fo that the Reprefentation of the parallel Lines, which 
appear very diftinctly in the Focus of the Lenfes, occupies the whole Diameter of the 
greateft Circle on the Reticulum. This being done, the Number ^3 Min. muft be made 
upon the Tubes, in the Places wherein each of the Lenfes and Reticulum ought to be. Pro- 
ceed in this manner for the Angles of 32 Min. 31 Min. 30 Min. and 29 Min. 

If the Diftances, denoted upon the Tubes between the different Pofitions of the Lenfes 
and the Reticulum, anfwering to a Minute, be divided into 60 equal Parts, we fhall have 
their Pofitions for every Second ; and by this means the fame Circle of the Reticulum may 
be accommodated to all the different apparent Diameters of the Sun and Moon, and the 
Diameter of the greateft Circle being divided into 12 equal Parts, it will ferve to meafure 
the Quantities of all folar and lunar Eclipfes. 

The fecond Method taken from Opticks, being not founded upon fo great a Number of 
Experiments as the former, may perhaps appear eafier to fome Perfons •, for the Foci of both 
the Lenfes being known, fay, As the Sum of the focal Lengths of the Lenfes (whether they 
be equal or not) lefs the Diftance between the Lenfes, is to the focal Length of the out- 
ward Lenfe, lefs the Diftance between the Lenfes ; So is this fame Term, to a fourth, 
which being taken from the focal Length of the outward Lens, there remains the Diftance 
from the outward Lens, to the common Focus of the Lenfes, which is the Place of the 
Reticulum. 

The Pofition of the common Focus of the Lenfes may alfo be known by this Method;- 
when they be joined, in ufing the aforefaid Analogy, without having any regard to the Di- 
ftance between the Lenfes. which is computed from the Places of the Lenfes Centers ; 
therefore in fuppofmg feveral different Diftances between the Object-Lenfes, the Length of 
their Foci will he had, that is, the Place of the Reticulum, correfpondent to each Di- 
ftance. 

Again, fay, As the known focal Length is to the Semidiameter of the Reticulum, be it 
what it will •, So is Radius, to the Tangent of the Angle anfwering to the Semidiameter of 
the Reticulum. By this Method we may likewife have the Magnitude of the faid Reticu- 
lum, in faying, As Radius is to the Tangent of an Angle of 17 Min. 3 Sec. So is the focal 
Length of the Lenfes, to the Semidiameter of the outward concentnek Circle. Having 
thus found the Minutes and Seconds fubtended by the Diameter of the greateft Circle of 
the Reticulum, according to the different Intervals of the Lenfes, they muft be wrote upon 
each Tube of the Lenfes and Reticulum, and the Diftances between the Terms found, di- 
vided into Seconds, as is mentioned in the former Method. And thus may the Pofitions of 
the Lenfes and Reticulum be foon found, which fhall contain the apparent Diameters of the 
Sun or Moon, according as they appear. If it be found very difficult to draw exactly the 

con- 



Chap. 3. Of making Celeftial Obferva lions ; 167 

concentrick Circles upon the Piece of Glafs, you need but draw thirteen right Lines there- 
on with the Point of a Diamond, equally diftant and parallel to each other, with another 
rip-he Line perpendicular to them ; but the Length of this Perpendicular between the two 
extreme Parallels, mud be equal to the Diameter of the Reticulum, found in the manner 
aforefaid. This Reticulum may be ufed inftead of one compofed of Hairs. 

A plain thin Piece of Glafs, having Lines drawn thereon with a very fine Point of a Dia- 
mond, may likewife be ufed in an Aftronomical Telefcope, &amp;c. for if it be adjufted in its 
proper Frame, in the manner as is directed in the Micrometer, the Lines drawn thtreon 
may be ufed inftead of the parallel Hairs. I am of opinion, that the aforefaid Reticula are 
very ufeful in practical Aftronomy, they not being fubject to the Inconftancies of the Air, 
of being gnawed by Infects, Or to the Motions of the Inftrument, which the Hairs are. 

There are thofe who prefer Hairs, to Lines drawn upon a Piece of Glafs, whofe Surface 
may caufe fome Obfcurity to the Objects, or if it be not very flat, there may fome Error 
arife: but if they have a mind to avoid thefe Difficulties, which are of no confequence, 
as we know by Experience, they may ufe ftraight Glafs-Threads, inftead of Hairs : for 
fome of thefe may be procured as fine as Hairs, and of Strength enough to refift the Incon- 
ftancies of the Air. 

Although the Phafes or Appearances of the Eclipfes of the Moon, apply'd by Aftronomers 
to Aftronomical and Geographical Ufes, may be obferved much eafier and exacter by our 
Reticulum, than by the ancient Methods ; yet it muft be acknowledged, that the Immerfions 
into, and Emerfions of the Moon's Spots out of the Earth's Shadow, may more conve- 
niently be obferved, becaufe of their great Number, than the Phafes, and that there is 
lefs Preparation is ufing a Telefcope, which need be only fix Feet in length : and in order 
for this, a Map of the Moon's Difk, when it is at the full, muft be procured, wherein are 
denoted the proper Names of the Spots, and principal Places appearing on its Difk. This 
may be found in the reformed Aftronomy of R. P. Riccioli^ &amp;c. 

There are great Advantages arifing from Obfervations of Eclipfes, for if the exact Time 
of the Beginning of an Eclipfe of the Moon, of it's total Immerfion in the Shadow, of it's 
Emerfion and it's End, as likewife of the Paffage of the Earth's Shadow by the Spots on it's 
Surface, be obferved, we fhall have the Difference of Longitude of the two Places wherein 
the Obfervations are made; this is known to all Aftronomers. But fince Lunar Eclipfes 
feldom happen, fo as that the Difference of Longitude may thereby be concluded, the 
Eclipfes of Jupiter *s Satellites may be obferved inftead of them ; but principally of the firft, 
whofe Motion about Jupiter being very fwift, one may make feveral Obfervations thereof 
during the Space of one Year ; and from thence the Difference of Longitude of the two 
Places, wherein the faid Obfervations are made, may be had. 

Neverthelefs you muft take notice, that Lunar Eclipfes may much eafier be obferved, 
than the Eclipfes of Jupiter's Satellites, which cannot be eafily and exactly done without a 
Telefcope of twelve Feet in length •, whereas the Phafes of the Beginning or End, or of 
the Immerfion and Emerfion of Lunar Eclipfes, may be obferved without a Telefcope, and 
the Immerfions and Emerfions of its Spots with one of an indifferent length. 

M. Caffmi, a very excellent Aftronomer of the Academy of Sciences, publifhed in the 
Year 1693, exact T-.bles of the Motions of Jupiter's Satellites ; therefore in comparing the 
Times of the Immerfion or Emerfion of Jupiter's firft Satellite, found by the Tables fitted 
for the Obfervatory (at Paris) with the Obfervations thereof made in any other PJace, we 
fhall have, by the Difference of Time, the Difference of Longitude of the Obfervatory, 
and the Place wherein the Obfervations were made : which may be confirmed in obferving 
the fame Phsenomena in both Places. 

It is proper here to inform Obfervators of one Cafe, which often hinders an exact Ob- 
fervation of Jupiter's Satellites; which is, that in a ferene Night, we often find the Light 
of Jupiter and its Satellites, obferved thro' the Telefcope, to diminifh by little and little, 
fo that it is impoffible to determine exactly the true Times of the Immerfion and Emerfion 
of the Satellites. Now the Caufe of this Accident proceeds from the Object-Glafs of the 
Telefcope, which is covered over with Dew, and thereby a great Number of Rays of 
Light, coming from Jupiter and its Satellites, is hinder'd from coming thro' the Object- 
Glafs to the Eye. A very fure Remedy for this, is, to make a Tube of blotting Paper; 
that is, a Tube about two Feet long, and big enough to go about the End of the Tube of 
the Telefcope next to the Object-Glafs, muft be made, in rolling two or three Sheets of 
finking Paper upon each other. This Tube being adjufted about the Tube of the Te- 
lefcope, will fuck in or drink up the Dew, and hinder its coming to the Object-Glafs -, 
and by this Means v/e may make our Obfervations conveniently.

Of the ConftruElion and Ufe of an Inflrument J&gt; hewing the Eclipfes 
of the Sun and Moon, the Months a?id Lunar Tears y as alfo the 
EpaSis. 

Fig- 13. PT"* H I S Inflrument was invented by M. de la Hire, and is compofed of three round 

J[ Plates of Brafs, or Pieces of Pafte-board, and an Index which turns about a common 
Center upon the Face of the upper Plate, which is the leaft. There are two circular 
Bands, the one blue, and the other white, in which are made little round Holes ; the out- 
ward of which fhews the New Moons, and the Image of the Sun ; and the inward ones, 
the Full Moons, and the Image of the Moon. The*. Limb of this Plate is divided into 12 
lunar Months, each containing 29 Days, 12 Hours, 44 Minutes •, but in fuch manner, that 
the End of the 12th Month, which makes the Beginning of the fecond lunar Year, may 
furpafs the firft New Moon by the Quantity of 4 of 1 yy Divifions s denoted upon the 
middle Plate. 

Upon the Limb of this Plate is faftened an Index, one of whofe Sides, which is in the 
fiducial Line, makes part of a right Line, tending to the Cente'r of the Inflrument ; which 
Line alfb pafTes thro' the Middle of one of the outward'Holes, fhewing the firft New Moon 
of the lunar Year. Note, The Diameter of the Holes is equal to the Extent of about 4 
Degrees. 

The Limb of the fecond Plate is divided into 1 79 equal Parts, ferving for fo many lunar 
Years, each of which is 354. Days, and about 9 Hours. The firft Year begins at the Num- 
ber 179, at which the laft ends. 

The Years accomplifhed are each denoted by their Numbers 1,2, 3, 4, &amp;c. at every fourth 
Divifion, and which make four times a Revolution to compleat the Number 179, as may 
be feen in the Figure of this Plate. Each of the lunar Years comprehend four of the afore- 
faid Divifions : So that in this Figure they anticipate one upon the other four of the faid 179 
Di virions of the Limb. 

Upon the Limb of the fame Plate, under the Holes of the firft, there is a Space coloured 
black, anfwering to the outward Holes, and which fhews the Eclipfes of the Sun, and an- 
other red Space, anfwering to the innermoft Holes, fhewing the Eclipfes of the Moon. 
The Quantity of each Colour appearing through the Holes, fhews the Eignefs of the 
Eclipfe. The Middle of the two Colours, which is the Middle of the Moon's Node, anfwers 
on one Side to the Divifion marked 4 * of a Degree ; and on the other Side it anfwers to 
the oppofite Number. 

The Figure of the coloured Space is fhewn upon this fecond Plate, and it's Amplitude or 
Extent fhews the Limits of Eclipfes. 

The third and greateft Plate, which is underneath the others, contains the Days and 
Months of common Years. The Divifions begin at the firft Day of March, to the End that 
a Day may be added to the Month of February, when the Year is Bijfextile. The Days of 
the Year are defcribed in form of a Spiral, and the Month of February goes out beyond the 
Month of March, becaufe the lunar Year is fhorter than the folar one; fo that the 15th 
Hour of the 10th Day of February anfwers to the Beginning of March : But after having 
reckoned the laft Day of February, you muft go back again to have the firft of March. 
T fie re are thirty Days marked before the Month of March, which ferve to find the 
Epacts. 

Note, That the Days, as they are here taken, are not accomplifhed purfuant to the Ufe 
of Aftronomers, but as they are vulgarly reckoned, beginning on a Minute, and ending at 
the Minute of the following Day. Therefore every time that the firft Day, or any other 
of a Month is fpoken of, we underftand the Space of that Day marked in the Divifions ; 
for we here reckon the current Days according to vulgar Ufe. 

In the Middle of the upper Plate are wrote the Epochs, fhewing the Beginning of the 
lunar Years, with refptct to the folar Years, according to the Gregorian Calendar, and for 
the Meridian of Paris. The Beginning of the firft Year, which muft be denoted by o, and 
anfwers to the Divifion 179, happened in the Year 1680 at Paris, the 29th of February at 
14 ! Hours. The End of the firft lunar Year, being the Beginning of the fecond, anfwers 
to rhe Divifion marked 1, which happened at Paris in the Year 1681, the 27th of February, 
at 23 ! Hours, in counting fucceflivcly 24 Hours from one Minute to the other. And left 
there fhould be an Error in comparing the Divifions of the Limb of the fecond Plate with 
the Divifions of the Epochs of the lunar Years anfwering them, we have put the fame Numbers 
r.o them both. 

We 



Chap. 4° of an Inftrument Jhewing Eclipfcs. 169 

We have fet down fucccflively the Epochs of all the lunar Years, from the Year 1700 trJ 
the Year 1750, to the End that the Ufe of this Inftrument may more cafily ferve to make 
each of the aforefaid folar and lunar Years agree together. As to the other Years of our 
Cycle of 179 Years, it will be eafy to render it compleat, in adding 354 Days, 8 Hours* 
48 '■ Minutes for each lunar Year. 

The Index extending itfelf from the Center of the Inftrument to the Limb of the greateft 
Plate, ferves to compare the Divifions of one Plate with thofe of the two others. And if 
this Inftrument be applied to a Clock, a perfect and accomplifhed Inftrument in all it's Parts 
will be had. 

The Table of Epochs, which is fitted for the Meridian of Paris, may eafily be reduced to 
other Meridians ; if for the Places eaftward of Paris, the Time of the Difference of Meri- 
dians be added ; and for Places weft ward, the Time of the Difference of Meridians be 
fubftracted. 

It is proper to place the Table of Epochs in the Middle of the upper Plate, to the End 
that it may be feen with the Inftrument. 

How to make the , Divifions upon the Plates. 

The Circle of the greateft Plate is fo divided, that 368 Deg. 2 Min. 42 Sec. may compre- 
hend 354 Days, and fomething lefs than 9 Hours j from whence it is manifeft, that the 
Circle mult contain 346 Days, 15 Hours, which may without fenfible Error be taken for ~ of 
a Day. Now to divide a Circle into 346 2 equal Parts, reduce the whole into third Parts, 
which in this Example make 1040 ; then feek the greateft Multiple of 3 lefs than 1040, 
which may be halved. Such a Number will be found in a double Geometrical Progrefiionj 
whofe firft Term is 3 ; as for Example, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384, 768. 

Now the 9th Number of this Progreffion is the Number fought. Then fubftract 768 
from 1040, there will remain 272, and find how many Degrees, Minutes, and Seconds, this 
remaining Number makes ; by faying, As 1040 is to 360 Deg. So is 272 to 94 Deg. 9 Min. 
23 Sec. 

Therefore take an Angle of 94 Deg. 9 Min. 23 Sec. from the faid Circle, and divide the 
remaining Part of the Circle always into half* after having made 8 Subdivifions, you will 
come to the Number 3, which will be the Arc of one Day ; by which likewile dividing the 
Arc of 94 Deg. 9 Min. 23 Sec. the whole Circle will be found divided into 3464 Days; 
for there will be 256 Days in the greateft Arc, and 90 I Days in the other. Each of thefe 
Spaces anfwer to 1 Deg. 2 Min. 18 Sec. as may be feen in dividing 360 by 346 4&gt; ar &gt;d 
ten Days make 10 Deg. 23 Min. And thus a Table may be made, ferving to divide the 
Plate. 

Thofe Days are afterwards diftributed to each of the Months of the Year, according 
to the Number correfponding to them, in beginning at the Month of March, and continuing 
on to the 15th Hour of the 10th of February, which anfwers to the Beginning of March, and 
the other Days of the Month of February go on farther above March. 

The Circle of the Second Plate mult be divided into 179 equal Parts ; to do which, feek 
the greateft Number which may be continually bifected to Unity, and be contained exactly 
in 179 : you will find 128 to be this Number, which take from 179, and there remains 51. 
Now find what part of the Circumference of the Circle the faid Remainder makes •, in fay- 
ing, As 179 Parts is to 360 Deg. So is 51 Parts to 102 Deg. 34 Min. 11 Sec. 

Therefore having taken from the Circle an Arc of 102 Deg. 34 Min. 11 Sec. divide the 
remaining Part of the Circle always into half; and after having made feven Subdivifions, you 
will come to Unity: whence this part of the Circle* will be divided into 128 equal Parts ; 
and then the remaining 51 Parts may be divided, by iielp of the laft Opening of the Com- 
paffes. Wherefore the whole Circumference will be found divided into 179 equal Parts* 
every of which anfwers to 2 Deg. 40 Sec. as may be feen in dividing 360 by 179. 

Laftly, To divide the Circle of the upper Plate, take one fourth of it's Circumference, 
and add to it one of the 179 Parts or Divifions of the Limb of the middle Plate •, the Com- 
panies opened to the Extent of the Quadrant thus augmented, being turned four Times over, 
will divide the Circle in the Manner as it ought to be : for in fubdividing every of the Quar- 
ters into three equal Parts, one will have twelve Spaces for the twelve Lunar Months, in 
fuch manner, that the End of the 12th Month, which makes the Beginning of the Lunar 
Year, exceeds the firft New Moon by 4 of the 179 Divifions, marked upon the middle 
Plate. 

Ufe of this Inftrument. 

A Lunar Year being propofed, to find the Days of the Solar Year correfponding to it, 
in which the New and Full Moons, together with the Eclipfes, ought to happen. 

For Example ; Let the 24th Lunar Year of the Table of Epochs be propofed, which an- 
fwers to the Divifion 24 of the middle Plate. Fix the Fiducial Line of the Index on the 
Upper Plate, over the Divifion marked 24, in the middle Plate, wherein the Beginning of 
the 25th Lunar Year is •, and feeing by the Table of Epochs, that that Beginning tails upon 
the 14th Day of June, of the Year 1703, at 9 Hours, 52 Minutes, turn the two upper 

X x Plates 



i jo The Conjlruclion and Ufes Book VI. 

Plates together, in the Pofition they are in, till the Fiducial Line of the Index, fattened to the 
upper Plate, anfwers to the ioth Hour, or thereabouts, of the 4th of June, denoted upon 
the undermoft Plate ; at which time, the firft New Moon of the propoied Lunar Year hap- 
pens : for then the Fiducial Line paffes thro' the middle' of the Hole of the firft New 
Moon of the faid Lunar Year. 

Afterwards, without changing the Situation of the three Plates, extend a Thread from 
the Center of the Inftrument, or the moveable Index, making it pafs thro' the middle 
of the Hole of the firft Full Moon •, and the Fiducial Line will anfv/er to the beginning of 
the 29th Day of June, at 4 Hours and a Quarter •, which is the time that that Full Moon was 
totally eclipfed, as appears by the red Colour quite filling the Hole, fhewing the Full 
Moon. 

By the fame means we may know, that at the time of the Full Moon, which happened 
about the third Hour in the Morning, of the 14th of July, there was a partial Eclipfe of 
the Sun. 

If we proceed farther, the Eclipfes may be known which happened in the Month of 
December, in the Year 1703, and towards the beginning of the following Year. But becaufe 
the ioth New Moon goes out beyond the 28th Day ot February, having brought the Index 
to the 28th Day of February, move the two upper Plates backwards, conjointly with the 
Index (in the Pofture they are found in) until the Fiducial Line happens over the be- 
ginning of March -, whence moving the Index over all the Holes of the New and Full 
Moons, and the laft Plate will fhew the times in which the Eclipfes ought to happen. 

But becaufe the 13th New Moon is the firft of the fucceeding Lunar Year, which an- 
fwers to the Number 25 of the Divifions of the middle Plate, leave the two undermoft 
Plates in the pofture they are found, and move forwards the upper Plate 'till the Fiducial 
Line meets with the Number 25 of the middle Plate, at which Point it will fhew upon the 
greateft Plate, the firft New Moon of the 26th Lunar Year, according to the order of our 
Epoch, which happened the 2d Day of June, 18 Hours 40 Minutes of the Year 1704; and 
afterwards moving the Index over the middle of the Holes of the New and Full Moons, it 
■will fhew upon the laft Plate the Days they happened on, as well as the Eclipfes to the End 
of February : after which, the fame Operation muft be made for the preceding Year, that is, 
that after having come to the laft Day of February, you muft proceed backwards to the firft 
Day of March. 

We might likewife find the Beginnings of all the Lunar Years without ufing the Table of 
Epochs •, but fince it is not poffible to adjuft the Plates and the Index fo exactly one upon 
another, as that fome Error may not happen, which will augment itfelf from Year to Year, 
the faid Table of Epochs will ferve to rectify the Ufe of this Inftrument. 

In placing the Fiducial Line of the Index upon the Moon's Age, between the Days of the 
Lunar Months, denoted upon the Limb of the upper Plate, the correfpondent Days of 
the common Months will be fhewn, and the Flours nearly, upon the Limb of the lower 
Plate. 

Note, That the Calculations of the Table of Epochs are made for the mean Time of 
the Full Moons, which fuppofes the Motions of the Sun and Moon always equable ; from 
whence there will be found fome Difference between the apparent Times of the New Moons, 
Full Moons, and Eclipfes, as they appear from the Earth, and the times found by that Table. 

The proper Motions of the Sun and Moon, as well as thofe of the other Planets, appear to 
us fometimes fwift, and fometimes flow ; which apparent Inequality in part proceeds from 
their Orbits being not concentric with the Earth, and in part from hence, that the equal 
Arcs of the Ecliptick, which are oblique to the Equator, do not always pafs thro' the Me- 
ridian with the equal Parts of the Equator. Aftronomers, for the eafe of Calculation, have 
fitted a Motion which they call mean or equable, in fuppofing the Planets to defcribe equal 
Arcs of their Orbits, in equal Times. That Time which they call true or apparent, is 
the meafure of true or apparent Motion, and mean Time is the meafure of mean Motion. 
They have likewife invented Rules for reducing mean Time to true or apparent Time, and 
contrariwife, for reducing true or apparent Time to mean Time. 

To find by Calculation whether there will happen an Eclipfe at the time of the New or 

Full Moon. 

For an Eclipfe of the Sun, multiply by 7361, the Number of Lunar Months accom- 
plifhed from that which begun the 8th of January, 1701, according to the Gregorian 
Calendar, to that which you examine, and add to the Product the Number 33890 •, then 
divide the Sum by 43200 ; and after the Divifion, without having regard to the Quotient, 
examine the Remainder, or the difference between the Divifor and the Remainder : for if 
either of them be lefs then 4060, there will happen an Eclipfe of the Sun. 

But to find an Eclipfe of the Moon, likewife multiply by 7361, the Number of Lunar 
Months, accomplifhed from that which begun the 8th of January, 1701, to the New Moon 
preceding the Full Moon examined •, add to the Product 37326, and divide the Sum by 43200. 
The Divifion being made, if the Remainder, or the difference between the Remainder and 
the Divifor, be lefs than 2800, there will be an Eclipfe of the Moon,

Note. An Eclipfe of the Sun or Moon will be fo much the greater, as the Remainder or 

Difference is lefTer ; and contrariwife. 

Example of an Eclipfe of the Sun. 

It is required to find, whether at the New Moon of the 22d of May, in the Year 1705* 
there happened an Eclipfe of the Sun. 

From the 8th of January? 1701. to the 22d of May, 1705, there were accomplilhed 54 
Lunations. Multiply, according to the Rule, the Number 54 by 7361, and add to 
the Product 33890: the Sum being divided by 43200, there will remain 42584* 
which is greater than 4060 ; and the Difference between the Remainder 42584, and the 
Divifor 43200, is 616, which is lefs than 4060 : therefore there was then an Eclipfe of the 

Sun. 

Example of an Eclipfe of the Moon. 

It is required to find whether the Full Moon of the 27th of April, in the Year 1706, was 
cclipfed. 

From the 8th of January, in the Year 1701, to the New Moon preceding the Full Moon 
in queftion, there were 65 Lunar Months accomplished ; therefore having multiplied, accord- 
ing to the Rule, the Number 65 by 7361, and added to the Product ^^26, the Sum will 
be 5 1 579 1 ; which being divided by 43200, without having any regard to the Quotient, the 
Remainder will be 40591, greater than 2800. The Difference between the Divifor and the 
Remainder is 609, which is lefs than 2800 ; therefore there was an Eclipfe of the Moon the 
27th day of April, 1 706. 

CHAP. V. 

The Defcriptiofi of a Second-Pe?tdulu7n-Clock for Agronomical 

Obfervations. 

THE Figure here adjoined, fhews the Compofition of a Second-Pendulum-Clock, pf a te ij] 
whofe two Plates A A and BB, are about half a Foot long, and two Inches and a Fig. 1. 
half broad, having four little Pillars at the four Corners, that fo they may be an Inch 
and a half diftant from each other. Thefe Plates ferve to fuftain the Axes of the principal 
Wheels, the firft of which being the loweft, and figured C C, hath 80 Teeth. The Axis 
of this Wheel hath a little Pulley, having feveral Iron Points D D round about the fame, 
in order to hold the Cord to which the Weights are hung, in the manner as we fhall ex- 
plain by and by. The Wheel C C, being turned by the Weight, likewife turns the Pinion, 
E of eight Teeth, end fo moves the Wheel F, which is faftened to the Axis of the Pinion 
E •, this Wheel hath forty-eight Teeth, which falling into the Teeth of the Pinion G, whofe 
Number is eight, moves the Wheel H, (made in figure of a Crown) confiding of forty- 
eight Teeth. Again, The Teeth of this laft Wheel fall into the Teeth of the Pinion I, 
whofe Number is twenty-four, and the Axis thereof being upright, carries the Wheel K of 
15 Teeth, which are made in Figure of a Saw: Over this Wheel is a crofs Axis, having 
two Palats L L, fuftained by the Tenons N, Qjmd P, which are faftened to the Plate B B. 
It rnuft be obferved, that as to the Tenons N and Q, the lower part Q^ appearing, hath a 
great Hole drilled therein, that the Axis LM may pafs thro' it ; this part Q, which is 
faftened to the lower part of the Tenon N, likewife holds the Wheel K, and the Pinion I. 
There is a great Opening in the Plate BB, in order for the Axis and the Palats to go out be- 
yond it. One end of this Axis (as I have already mentioned) goes into the Tenon, P, 
and fo moves eafier than if it was fuftained by the Plate B B, and then go out be- 
yond the faid Plate, which it muft neceffarily do, that fo the little Stern S, fixed thereto, may 
freely vibrate with the faid Axis, and the Teeth of the Wheel K alternately meet the Palats 
LL, as in common Clocks. 

The lower part of the little Stern S is bent, and a flit made therein, thro' which goes an 
Iron-Rod, ferving as a Pendulum, having the Lead X at the End thereof. This Rod is 
faftened in V to a very thin Piece of Brafs or Steel, which vibrates between two cycloidal 
Cheeks TT, (one of which is feen in Fig. 1, and both in Fig. 2.) of which more hereafter. 

It is eafy to perceive in what manner this Clock goes by the Force of the Wheels car- 
ried round by the Weight: for the Motion is continued by the Pendulum V X, when the 
faid Pendulum is fct a-going ; becaufe the little Stern S, altho' very light, being in moti- 
on, not only goes with the Pendulum, but likewife by its Vibrations ftill affifts the Mo- 
tion fome fmall matter, and ib renders it perpetual, which otherwife by Friction and the 
Air's refiftance, would come to nothing. But becaufe the Property of the Pendulum is to 
move equably always, provided its length be the fame, the faid Pendulum will caufe the 
Wheel K to go neither too faft nor too flow, (as happens to Clocks not having Pendulums) 

* every 



17a ^The Conflruclion and Ufes Book VI. 

every Tooth is Obliged to move equably ; therefore the other Wheels, and the Hands of 
the Dial-plate, are necefiarily constrained to perform their Revolutions equably. Whence 
if there mould be fome Delault in the Conftruction of the Clock, or if the Axes of the 
Wheels do not move freely on account of the Intemperance of the Air, provided the Clock 
does not ftand ftill ; we have nothing to fear from thefe Inequalities, for the Clock will 
always go true. 

As to the Hands for fhewing the Hours, Minutes, and Seconds, we difpofe them in 
the following manner. The third Plate Y Y is parallel to the two precedent ones, and 
is three Lines diftant from A A. We defcribe a Circle about the Center a, which is the 
middle of the Axis, carrying the Wheel C, continued out beyond the Plate A A. This 
Circle is divided into 12 equal Parts, for the Hours. We likewife defcribe another Circle 
about the faid Center, and divide it into 60 equal Parts, for the Minutes in an Hour. We 
place the Wheel b upon the Axis R, continued out beyond the Plate A A, faftened to a little 
Tube, going out beyond the Plate Y Y to e. This Tube is put about the Axis R, and 
turns about with it, in fuch manner neverthelefs, that it may be turned only when there is 
neceffity. We place the Hand fhewing the Minutes in e, which makes one Revolution in an 
Hour. The beforementioncd Wheel b moves the Wheel h, having the fame Number of 
Teeth as that, viz. 30 ; and the Teeth of the Wheel/, falls into the Teeth of the Pinion h, 
whofe Number is 6, and they have a little Axis common to them, which is partly fuftained 
by the Tenon d. This Pinion moves round the Wheel /, having 72 Teeth, faftened to a 
little 'Tube g, which is put about the Tube carrying the Wheel b. Now the Hand fhew- 
ing the Hours mu ft be placed upon the Extremity of the Tube^, and will be fhorter than 
that denoting the Minutes. But that one may not be deceived in reckoning of Seconds, 
we place a round Plate m m upon the Extremity of the Axis of the Wheel H, divided in- 
to 60 equal Parts, and make an opening Z in the Plate Y, in the upper Part of which Open- 
ing is a fmall Point 0, which, as the faid Plate turns about, fhews the Seconds. The Dif- 
pofition of the Hands and Circles will be eafier feen in Figure 3, which reprefents the 
Outfide of the Clock. 

Now having fpoken of the Difpofition of the Wheels, the next thing is to determine 
the Length of the Pendulum, which muft be fuch, that every of its Vibrations be made 
in a Second of Time. This Length muft be 3 Feet 8 4 Lines (of Paris *) from the Point 
of Sufpenfion, which is the Center of the cycloidal Cheeks, to the Center of the 
Weight X. 

We now proceed to fay fomething concerning the Times of the Revolutions of the 
Wheels and the Hands, in order to confirm what we have already faid of the Number of 
Teeth. Now one Revolution of the Wheel CC, makes ten Revolutions of the Wheel F, 
fixty of the Wheel H, and one hundred and twenty of the upper Wheel K, which having 
15 Teeth, and alternately pufhing the Palats L L, makes thirty Vibrations, which are fo 
many goings and comings of the Pendulum VX. Whence 120 Revolutions of the Wheel 
K, is equal to 3600 Vibrations of the Pendulum, which are the Seconds contained in one 
Hour ; and fo the Wheel C makes one Revolution in an Hour, and the Hand e faftened 
thereto, mews the Minutes ; and becaufe the Wheel b makes it's Revolution in the fame 
time, (viz. an Hour) the Wheel h hath the fame Number of Teeth as b, and the Pinion 
on the fame Axis hath fix Teeth j and fince the Number of Teeth of the Wheel/ is twelve 
times greater, the faid Wheel will go round once in 12 Hours, as likewife the Hand g 
faftened thereto. Finally, Becaufe the Wheel H is making fixty Revolutions in the fame 
time the Wheel CC is making one, therefore the circular Plate Z, having the Seconds deno- 
ted thereon, will move once round in a Minute ; and fo every 60th part of the faid Plate 
will fhew one Second. 

The Weight X, at the end of the Pendulum, muft weigh about 3 Pounds, and be of 
Lead covered with Brafs. Regard muft not only be had to its Weight, but likewife to its 
Figure, which is of Confequence, becaufe the leaft Refiftance of the Air is prejudicial 
thereto j whence We make it in form of a Convex Cylinder a, whofe ends are pointed, as 
appears in Figure 3. wherein the Pendulum is reprefented, tho' the Weights at the end of 
the Pendulums made for thefe Clocks ufed at Sea are in the Figure X, in form of a Lens, 
this Figure being found more proper than the other. 
Fig. 3# In the fame Figure may likewife be feen the manner of the Difpofition of the Weight b, 

in order to fo move the Clock, that it may not ftand ftill while the Weight b is drawing up ; 
and this is done by means of a Cord, one end of which muft firft be faftened to a piece of 
Iron fixed to the Plate A A, (of Figure 1.) and then it muft be put about the Pulley c, 
of the Weight b •, afterwards over the Pulley d, (which hath Iron Points round it in figure 
of the Teeth of a Saw, for hindering, left the Weight b fhould pull the Cord down all at 
once) then about the Pulley/ of the Weighty, and laft of ail the other end of the faid 
Cord muft be fixed to fome proper Place. Things being thus difpofed, it is manifeft that 
half of the Weight b moves the Wheels round, and that the Motion of the Clock doth not 
ceafe, when the Cord e is pulled with one's Hand in order to draw the Weight b up. Note, 
The Weight £ is for fuftaining the Weight £, and need not be near fo big. 

The

Chap. 5. of a Second Pendulum-Clock. 173 

The Weight of b cannot be certainly determined by Reafoning, but the lefs it is the 
better, provided it be iufficient to make the Clock go. They weigh generally about fix 
Pounds in the belt Kind of thefe Clocks that have yet been made, whereof the Diameter of 
the Pulley D is one Inch, the Weight of the Pendulum X three Pounds, and it's Length three 
Feet 8 • Lines. Note, If this Clock be at the Height of a Man above the Ground, it will go 
30 Hours. 

We now proceed to fhew the Manner of making the Cycloidal Cheeks between which the Fig, 4, 
Pendulum fwings, and in which the whole Exadlnefs of the Clock confifls. In order to 
do which, defcribe the Circle AFBK, whofe Diameter A B let be equal to half of the 
Length of the Pendulum ; aflume the equal Parts of the Circumference AC, CD, DE, 
E F°and AG, G H, H I, I K, and draw the Lines G C, H D, I E and K F, from one 
Divifion to the other, which Lines will be parallel. Now make the Line L M equal to the 
Arc AF, which divide into the fame Number of equal Parts as A F, and aflume one of 
thefe Parts, which lay off upon the Line CG, from C to N, and G to O. Again, Lay off 
two of the faid equal Parts of the Line L M, upon the Line D H, from D to P, and from 
H to Q^ Moreover, Aflume three of the faid equal Parts upon the Line L M, which lay 
off upon I E from E to R, and I to S. And finally, Aflume four of the faid Parts (which 
is the whole Length of the Line L M), and lay off upon K F, from F to T, and K to V ; 
and fo of other Parts, if there had been more of them affumed upon the Periphery of the 
Circle AFBK. Now if the Points N, P, R, T, as alfo O, &lt;£, S, V, be joined, we 
fhall have the Figure of the Cycloidal-Cheeks (between which the Pendulum fwings), which 
muft be afterwards cut out in Brafs. To draw the Line L M equal to the Arc A F, af- 
fume the two Semi-Chords of the Arcs A F, which lay off upon the Line X V, from X to Y ; 
this being done, take the whole Chord of the Arc A F, and lay off from X to Z, and divide 
Z Y into three equal Parts ; one of which being laid off from Z to V, and the Line X V will 
be nearly the Length of the Arc A F. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument fufficiently appears from what hath been already faid. 

The principal Inftruments that an Aftronomer ought to have, befides a good Quadrant, 
and Pendulum Clock, is a Telefcope feven or eight Feet long, having a Micrometer ad- 
jufted thereto, for obferving the Digits of Solar and Lunar Eclipfes, as likewife another of 
15 or 16 Feet, for the Obfervation of Jupiter's Satellites ; and, if poflible, a parallactick In- 
ftrument to take the Parallaxes of the Stars.

CHAP. I. 

Of the Globes. 



SECTION I. 

OF Globes there are two Kinds, viz. Celeftial and Terreftrial. The rTrft is a Repre- 
fentation of the Heavens, upon the Convex Surface of a material Sphere, contain- 
ing all the known Stars, after the manner that Aftronomers, for the eafier knowing 
them, have divided them into Conftellations, or Figures of Men, Beafts, Fowls, Fifb.es, &amp;V. 
according to the Refemblance they fancied each feledl Number of Stars formed. The other 
is the Terreftrial Globe, which is the Image of the Earth, on the Convex Surface of a ma- 
terial Sphere, exhibiting all the Kingdoms, Countries, Iflands, and other Places fituated 
upon it, in the fame Order, Figure, Dimenfions, Situation, and Proportion, refpecting one 
another as on the Earth itfelf. 

There are ten eminent Circles upon the Globe, fix of which are called greater, and the 
four other lejfer Circles. 

Y y A letter 



Fig s. &amp; $• 



174 The ConflruSiion and Ufes Book VI. 

A kfter Circle is that which is parallel to a greater, as the Tropicks and Polar Circles are 
to the Equator, and as the Circles of Altitude are to the Horizon. 

The great Circles are, 

I. The Horizon, which is a broad wooden Circle encompaffing the Globe about, having 
two Notches, one in the North, the other in the South part thereof, for the Brazen Me- 
ridian to fland, or move round in, when the Globe is to be fet to a particular Latitude. 

There are ufually reckoned two Horizons : Firft, The Viftble or Senjible Horizon, which 
may be conceived to be made by fome great Plane, or the Surface of the Sea ; and which di- 
vides the Heavens into two Hemifpheres, the one above, the other (apparently) below the 
Level of the Earth. 

This Circle determinates the Rifing and Setting of the Sun, Moon, or Stafcs, in any par- 
ticular Latitude : for when any one of them comes juft to the Eaftern edge of the Horizon, 
then we fay it Rifes ; and when it doth fo at the Weftern edge, we fay it Sets. And from 
hence alfo is the Altitude of the Sun or Stars reckoned, which is their height in Degrees above 
the Horizon. 

Secondly, The other Horizon is called the Real or Rational Horizon, and is a Circle encom- 
paffing the Earth exactly in the middle, and whofe Poles are the Zenith and Nadir, viz. two 
Points in its Axis, each 90 Deg. diftant from its Plane, (as the Poles of all Circles are) the 
one exactly over our Heads, and the other directly under our Feet. This is the Circle that 
th wooden Horizon on the Globe reprefents. 

On which Broad Horizon feveral Circles are drawn, the innermoft of which is the Num- 
ber of Degrees of the Twelve Signs of the Zodiack, viz. 30 to each Sign : for the ancient 
Aftronomers obferved the Sun in his (apparent) Annual Courfe, always to defcribe one and 
the' fame Line in the Heavens, and never to deviate from this Track or Path to the North 
or South, as all the other Planets did, more or lefs : and becaufe they fonnd the Sun to 
fhift as it were backwards, thro' all the Parts of this Circle, fo that in one whole Year's 
Courfe he would Rife, Culminate, and Set, with every Point of it •, they diftinguifhed the 
fixed Stars that appeared, in or near this Circle, into 12 Conftellations or Divifions, which 
they called Signs, and denoted them with certain Characters; and becaufe they are, 'molt of 
them ufually drawn in the form of Animals, they called this Circle by the Narne of Zo- 
diack, which fignifies an Animal, and the very middle Line of it the Ecliptick ; and fince 
every Circle is divided into 360 Degrees, a twelfth part of this Number will be 30, the 
Degrees in each Sign. 

Next to this you have the Names of thofe Signs; next to this the Days of the Months, 
according to the Julian Account, or Old Style, with the Calendar ; and then another C#- 
lendar, according to the Foreign Account or New Style. 

And. without thefe, is a Circle divided into thirty two equal Parts, which make the 32 
Winds or Points of the Mariners Compafs, with the Names annexed. 

The Ufes of this Circle in the Globe are, 

1. To determine the Rifing and Setting of the Sun, Moon, or Stars, and to fhew the 
time of it, by help of the Hour-Circle and Index •, as (hall be fhewn hereafter. 

2. To limit the Increafe and Decreafe of the Day and Night : for when the Sun rifes due 
Eaft, and fets Weft, the Days are equal. 

But when he Rifes and Sets to the North of the Eaft and Weft, the Days are longer than 
the Nights ; and contrariwife, the Nights are longer than the Days, when the Sun Rifes and 
Sets to the Southwards of the Eaft and Weft Points of the Horizon. 

3. To. fhow the Sun's Amplitude, or the Amplitude of a Star ; and alfo on what Point of 
the Compafs, it Rifes and Sets. 

II. The next Circle, is the Meridian, which is reprefented by the brazen Frame or Circle, 
in which the Globe hangs and turns. This is divided into four Nineties or 360 Degrees, 
beginning at the Equinoctial. 

This Circle is called the Meridian, becaufe when the Sun comes to the South part of it, 
it is Meridies, Mid-day, or High noon; and then the Sun hath its greateft Altitude for that 
Day, which therefore is called the Meridian Altitude. The Plane of this Circle is perpen- 
dicular to the Horizon, and pafTeth thro' the South and North Parts thereof, thro' the Zenith 
and Nadir, and thro' the Poles of the World. In it, each way from the Equinoclial on the 
Celeftial Globe, is accounted the North or South Declination of the Sun or Stars ; and on the 
Terrefirial, the Latitude of a Place North or South, which is equal to the elevation or height 
of the Pole above the Horizon : Becaufe the Diftance from the Zenith to the Horizon, being 
the fame as that between the Equinoclial and the Poles, if from each you imagine the Di- 
ftance from the Pole to the Zenith to be taken away, the Latitude will remain equal to the, 
Pole's Altitude. 

There are two Points of this Circle, each 90 Degrees diftant from the Equinoctial, 
which are called the Poles of the World, the upper one the North Pole, and the under one 
the South Pole. A Diameter continued thro' both the Poles in either Globe and the Center, 

is 



Chap. t. of the Globes. 173 

is called the Axis of the Earth or Heavens, on which they are fuppofed to turn 
about. 

The Meridians are various, and change according to the Longitude of Places ; for as 
foon as ever a Man moves but one Degree, or but a Point to the Eaft or Weft, he is 
under a New Meridian : But there is or mould be one fixed, which is called the firft Me- 
ridian. 

And this on fome Globes, pafies thro' one of the Azores Iflands : but the French place the 
firft' Meridian at Fero, one ot the Canary IQands. 

The Poles of the Meridian are the Eaft and Weft Points of the Horizon. On the Terrejtial 
Globe, are ufually drawn 24 Meridians, one thro' every 15 Degrees of the Equator, or every 
15 Degrees of Longitude. 

The Ufes of the Meridian Circle are, 

Firft, To fet the Globe to any particular Latitude, by a proper Elevation of the Pole above 
the Horizon of that Place. And, Secondly, To fhew the Sun or Stars Declination, right 
Afcenfion, and greatcft Altitude ; of which more hereafter. 

III. The next great Circle, is the Equinoclial Circle, as it is called on the Celeftial, and the 
Equator, on the Terreftriai Globe. This is a great Circle whofe Poles are the Poles of the 
World : it divides the Globe into two equal Parts or Hemifpheres, as to North and South ; 
it pafies thro' the Eaft and Weft Points of the Horizon, and at the Meridian is always as 
much railed above the Horizon, as is the Complement of the Latitude of any particular 
Place. Whenever the Sun comes to this Circle, it makes equal Days and Nights all round 
the Globe, becaufe it then Rifes due Eaft, and Sets due Weft, which it doth at no other time 
of the Year. All Stars alfo which are under this Circle, or which have no Declination, do al- 
ways Rife due Eaft, and Set full Weft. 

All People living under this Circle (which by Navigators is called the Line) have their 
Days and Nights conftantly equal. And when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, he will be at 
Noon in their Zenith, or directly over their Pleads, and fo their erect Bodies can eaft no 
Shadow. 

From this Circle both ways, the Sun, or Stars Declination on the Celeftial, or Latitude 
of all Places on the Terreflrial Globe, is accounted on the Meridian : and fuch lefiTer Circles 
as run thro' each Degree of Latitude or Declination parallel to the Equinoctial, are called Pa- 
rallels of Latitude or Declination. 

Through every 15 Degrees of this Equinoctial, the Hour-Circles are drawn at right An- 
gles to it on the Celeftial Globe, and all pafs thro' the Poles of the World, dividing the Equi- 
noctial into 24 equal Parts. 

And the Equator on the Terreftial Globe, is divided by the Meridians into 36 equal Parts ; 
which Meridians are equivalent to the Hour-Circles on the other Globe. 

IV. The Zodiack is another great Circle of the Globe, dividing the Globe into two equal 
Parts (as do all great Circles) : When the Points of Aries and Libra are brought to the Ho- 
rizon, it wiii cut that and the Equinoctial obliquely, making with the former an Angle equal 
to 23 Degrees 30 Minutes, which is the Sun's greatcft Declination. This Circle is accounted 
by Aftronomers as a Kind of broad one, and is like a Belt or Girdle: Through the Middle 
of it is drawn a Line called the Ecliptick, or Via Solis, the Way of the Sun ; becaufe the Sun 
never deviates from ir, in it's annual Courfe. 

This Circle is marked with the Characters of the Twelve Signs, and on it is found out the 
Sun's Place, which is under what Star or Degree of any of the Twelve Zodiacal Conjiellations, 
he appears to be in at Noon. By this are determined the four Quarters of the Year, accord- 
ing as t. ; Ecliptick is divided into four equal Parts ; and accordingly as the Sun goes on here, 
he has more or lefs Declination. 

Alfo (torn this Circle the Latitude of the Planets and fixed Stars are accounted from the 
Ecliptick towards the Poles. 

The Poles of this Circle are 23 Degrees, 30 Minutes diftant from the Poles of the World, 
or of trie Equinoctial •, and by their Motion round the Poles of the World, are the Polar 
Circles defcribed. 

V. If you imagine two great Circles both palling thro' the Poles of the World, and alfo 
one of them thro' the Equinoctial Points Aries and Libra, and the other thro' the Soljlitial 
Points, Cancer and Capricorn : Thefe are called the two Colures, the one the Equinoclial, and 
the other the Soljlitial Colure. Thefe. will divide the Ecliptick into four equal Parts, which 
are denominated according to the Points they pafs thro', called the four Cardinal Points, 
and are the firft Points of Aries, Libra, Cancer, and Capricorn. 

Thefe are all the great Circles. 

VI. If you fuppofe two Circles drawn parallel to the Equinoctial at 23 Degrees, 
30 Minutes, reckoned on the Meridian, thefe are called the Tropicks, becaufe 
the Sun appears, when in them, to turn backward from his former Courfe j the 

one 



1 7 6 7^ Conftruciion and Ufes B o o k V I. 

one, the Tropick of Cancer ; the other the Tropick of Capricorn, becaufe they are under 
thefe Signs. 

VII. If two other Circles are fuppofed to be drawn thro' 23 Degrees, 30 Minutes, 
reckoned in the Meridian from the Polar Points, thefe are called the Polar Circles : The 
Northern is the Arctick, and the Southern the Antarctick Circle, becaufe oppofite to the 
former. 

Thefe are the four leffer Circles. 

And thefe on the Terreftrial Globes, the Ancients fuppofed to divide the Earth into five Zones, 
viz. two Frigid, two Temperate, and the Torrid Zone. 

Befides thefe ten Circles already defcribed, there are fome other neceflary Circles to be 
known, which are barely imaginary, and only fuppofed to be drawn upon the Globe. 

1. Meridians, or Hour-Circles, which are great Circles all meeting in the Poles of the World, 
and crofting the Equinoctial at right Angles j thefe are fupplied by the brazen Meridian 
Hour-Circle and Index. 

2. Azimuths, or Vertical Circles, which likewife are great Circles of the Sphere, and meet 
in the Zenith and Nadir, as the Meridians and Hour-Circles do in the Poles ; thefe cut the 
Horizon at right Angles, and on thefe is reckoned the Sun's Altitude, when he is not in 
the Meridian. They are reprefented by the Quadrant of Altitude, by and by fpoken of, 
which being fixed at the Zenith, is moveable about the Globe thro' all the Points of the 
Compafs. 

3. There are alfo Circles of Longitude of the Stars and Planets, which are great Circles paf- 
fing thro' the Poles of the Ecliptick, and in that Line determining the Stars or Planets Place 
Or Longitude, reckoned from the firft Point of Aries. 

4. Almacanters, or Parallels of Altitude, are Circles having their Poles in the Zenith, and 
are always drawn parallel to the Horizon. Thefe are lefTer Circles of the Sphere, diminifh- 
ing as they go further and further from the Horizon. In refpect of the Stars, there are alfo 
Circles fuppoied to be Parallels of Latitude, which are Parallels to the Ecliptick, and have 
their Poles the fame as that of the Ecliptick. 

5. Parallels of Declination of the Sun or Stars, are lefTer Circles, whofe Poles are the 
Poles of the World, and are all drawn parallel to the Equinoctial, either North or South j 
and thefe (when drawn on the Terrejlrial Globe) are called Parallels of Latitude. 

VIII. There are belonging to Globes a Quadrant of Altitude, and Semi-Circle of Pofition. 
The firft is a thin pliable Piece of Brafs, whereon is graduated 90 Degrees anfwerable to 
thofe of the Equator, a fourth Part of which it reprefents •, with a Nut and Screw, to faften 
it to any part of the brazen Meridian as occafion requires. There is, or fliould be likewife, 
a Compafs belonging to a Globe, that fo it may be fet North and South. 

The Semi-Circle of Pofition is a narrow Plate of Brafs, infcribed with 180 Degrees, and 
anfwerable to juft half the Equator. 

Laftly, The Brafs Circle, faftened at right Angles on the brazen Meridian, and the Index 
put on the Axis, is called the Index and Hour-Circle. 

SECTION II. 

Having now defcribed the Circles of the Globes, I proceed to their Conjiruffion. 

The Body of the Globe is compofed of an Axle-Tree, two Paper-Caps fewed together, a 
Compofition of Plaifter laid over them, and laft of all globical Papers or Gores (of which. 
more by and by), (luck or glewed on the Plaifter. 

The Axle-Tree is a Piece of Wood which runs thro' the middle of the Globe, turned fome- 
times of an eaual Thicknefs, but oftner fmaller in the Middle than at the Ends ; where two 
Pieces of thick hardened Wire are ftruck in, which is the Axis, that appears without the 
Globe, on which it turns within the brazen Meridian. 

The Paper-Caps inclofe this Axle-Tree, and are made in the following Manner. You muft 
have a Ball of Wood turned round, about a Quarter of an Inch lefs in Diameter, than the 
Size you intend to make your Globe of, with two Pieces of Wire ftuck into it, diametri- 
cally oppofite to each other, for Conveniency of turning in a Frame, which may be made 
of two Pieces of Stick fixed upright in a Board, with Notches on the Tops to lay the Wire 
in. Round this wooden Ball you muft pafte wafte Paper, both brown and white, 'till you 
judge it to be of the Thicknefs of Pafteboard •, and before it be quite dry, cut it in the 
Middle, fo that it may come ofT in two Hemifpheres : to prevent the Paper faom flicking, 
let the Ball at firft making be thick painted, and every time before you pafte Paper on it, 
greafe or oil it a little. 

The Holes at the Tops of the Caps, occafioned by the Axis on which the Ball turned, 
are very convenient for the Axis of the Globe to go thro' in covering of it. Then having 
faftened the Top of the Caps with fmall Nails to each end of the wooden Axle-Tree, few 
them clofe together in the Middle with ftrone Twine. 

That 



Chap. i. of the Globes. 177 

That the Caps may meet exactly, obferve two things: ift, That the Axle-tree be juft 
in the Diameter of the Ball. 2dly, That before you take the Caps off the Ball, you make 
Scores a-crofs the parting all round, about an Inch afunder, whereby to bore the Holes for 
fewino- them even together, and leave a Mark to direct how to join them again in the fame 
points': for Inftance, make a Crofs over any one of the Scores in the upper Cap, and an- 
other Crofs upon the fame Score in the under Cap ; and when you clofe them, bring the 
two Croffes together, by which means the Caps in fewing will come as clofe together as 
before they were parted. This Care muft be taken, that there may be no Openings be- 
tween ; in which cafe, Paper muft be crammed in to flop up the Gaps : but whether there 
be any Gaps or no, there muft be Paper pafted all over it's fewing, to prevent any of the 
Plafter from falling in. 

The Plafter is made with Glue, diflblved over the Fire in Water and Whiting mixed 
up thick, with fome Hemp fhred fmall ; the Ufe of which is to bind the Plafter, and keep it 
from cracking (as Hair is put into Mortar for the fame End) : a Handful will ferve two or 
three Gallons of Stuff. There is no neceffity for mixing the whole over the Fire, except the 
Whitin^ runs into Lumps not eafily to be broken with the Hand. 

For laying on this Plafter over the Caps in a globular Form, you muft have a Steel Semi- 
Circle exactly half the Circumference you intend the Globe to have, fixed fiat-ways in a 1 
level Table made for that purpofe, with a Notch at each end for the Axis (which muft nicely 
fit it) to turn in, and two Buttons to cover it, to prevent the Axis from being forced out of 
the Notches, when the Globe is clogged with Plafter, and fo requires fome Violence to 
turn it. 

Then fixing your Paper-Sphere within this Semi-Circle, lay Plafter on it with your 
Hjnds, turning the Globe eafiiy round, 'till it be covered fo as to fill the Semi-Circle: But 
before it comes to touch the Semi-Circle in all it's Parts, and be equally fmooth all round, it 
wiil require a great many Layings on of the Plafter, letting it dry between every fuch Ap- 
plication. 

The fecond or third time of laying on Stuff, it will begin to touch the Semi-Circle in 
fome parts, and to appear round ; the fourth time it will touch in more parts, and look 
rounder •, 'till at laft it will touch in all parts, and become perfectly round and fmooth, like 
a Ball of polifhed Marble. 

The next thing to be done is to poife the Globe ; for it generally happens, by reafon of 
the Plafter lying thicker in one place than in another, that fome iide weighs ftili down- 
wards. To remedy this, a Hole muft be cut in that part, and a convenient Quantity of 
Shot put in, in a Bag, to bring it to a due Balance with the reft •, after which the Place 
muft be ftopped up with a Cork, and covered again •vith Piafter. The Bag tnat holds the 
Shot may be glewed or fewed to the Cap within, or faftened to the Cork : fometimes after 
one part is balanced, the Weight will incline to another •, in which cafe the fame Remedy 
muft be applied again, as often as there will be neceffity. 

This done, by help of another Semi-Circle, divided into 18 equal Parts, draw the Equa- 
tor and Parallels of Latitude, placing a Black-lead Pencil at the Graduation, and turning 
the Globe againfc the Point of it to make a Line. Then divide the Equator with a Pair of 
Compaffes into fo m&lt;*ny Parts as there are globical Papers or Gores to lay on, and draw 
Lines thro' each from Pole to Pole by the Side of the Semi-Circle. Within each of thefe 
Spaces fo marked out, you have only to lay one of the Gores, which (being cut out fo ex- 
act, as neither to lap over, nor leave a Vacancy between them) by the i\ffiftancc of the 
Lines drawn upon the Plafter, may be fitted, fo as to fall in with each other with the 
greateft Exactnefs. In applying the Gores, you may ufe a good binding Pafte, but Mouth 
Glue is better. 

SECTION III. 

ConJlruBion of the Circles of the Globe on the Globical Papers or Gores. 

As 7 is to 22, So is the Diameter of a Globe to the Circumference of any one of it's greateft 
Circles. The Diameter of the Globe is ufually given, from whence it often happens that 
the Circumference confifts of odd Numbers and Parts. Whereas if the Circumference was 
given in even Numbers, as Inches, it might more eafily be divided into Parts. For Ex- 
ample, if the Circumference was 36 Inches, each 10 Degrees of Longitude on the Equator 
will be one Inch •, if the Circumference be 54, each 10 Degrees will be one Inch and a half; 
if 72, every 10 Degrees of Longitude will be two Inches. 

The Diameter of a Globe being given, fuppofe 24 Inches, to find the Circumference, fay, 
As 7 is to 22, So is 24 to 75.43 Inches, the Length of the Circumference fought. 

The Length of each Gore, from the North Pole to the South Pole, will be exactly half 
the Circumference of the Globe, which is 37.71 Inches, and the Length from the Equator 
to either Pole will be ^, viz. 18.86 Inches. 

Z z If 



1 78 T'/je Conftruciion and Ufes Book VI. 

If each of the Globical Papers contain in their greateft Breadth 30 Degrees of the Equa- 
tor, 12 of them will cover the Globe, and by dividing the Circumference 75.43 by 12, 
the Quotient will give 6.28 Inches for the Breadth of the Gore. 

If 18 of the Gores go to cover the Globe, the Breadth of each will be 20 Degrees of 
the Equator, or 4.19 Inches. 

If 24, each will contain 15 Degrees of the Equator, or 3.14 Inches of the Circum- 
ference: 

If 36, each Paper will contain 10 Degrees of the Circumference, or 2.09 Inches. 

If the Globe be fo large as to take up 360 Papers, that is, one to every Degree of Longi- 
tude, then will the Breadth of each Gore be 23 parts of an Inch. 

Again, If the Circumference of a Globe be given, fuppofe 72 Inches, divide it by 2 (for 
the Length of the Gores from Pole to Pole) and the Quotient will be 36 Inches; and con- 
fequently half that Length, or the Diftance from the Equator to either Pole, will be 18 
Inches : as the Diftance from N. to S. taken from a fuppofed Scale of Inches, is 36 Inches, 
or one half of the Circumference of the Globe ; and the Diftance from C to N or S, 18 
Inches, or ' of the Circumference. 

If each Gore contains 30 Degrees of the Equator in Breadth, or T V of the Circumfe- 
rence, it will take up 6 Inches thereof as IK. 

If 18 of the Gores go to cover a Globe of the aforefaid Circumference, each will con- 
tain 20 Degrees in Longitude of the Equator, or 4 Inches, as L M. 

If your Papers be r ' T of the Circumference, each will contain 15 Degrees of the Equator, or 
or 3 Inches, as ab. 

If they be — °f tne Circumference, each will contain 10 Degrees of the Equator, or 
2 Inches, as c d. 

If there be 72 Papers for covering the Globe, each will contain 5 Degrees of the Equator, 
or 1 Inch, that is 7 \ of the Circumference. 

If, laftiy, the Globe requires 360 Papers, each will contain 1 Degree, or ' of an Inch. 

This being premifed, I now proceed to give the Manner of drawing the Circles of the 
Globes upon the aforefaid Gores. 
Fig. 7. Draw the Diameter W E, and crofs it with another at right Angles to it, as N S. From 

the Scale of Inches fet off from C to N, and to S, (the North and South Poles) 18 Inches 
or 4 of the Circumference, which divide into 9 equal parts, each of which likewife fub- 
divide into 10 more (for the 90 Degrees of North and South Latitude). Upon C, as a Cen- 
ter, defcribe the Circle NE, S W, and divide each Quadrant into 90 Degrees, numbering 
each 10th Degree with Figures from the Equator towards the Poles, as 10, 20, 30, &amp;c. 
Thus the three Points are found, thro' which the parallel Circles to the Equator rauft be 
drawn, viz. two of them are in the Quadrants N E, N W. and S E, S W, and the third 
is in the Diameter NS. 

To find the Centers of any of the faid Parallels, fuppofe of the Parallel of 60 Degree's, 
fet one Foot of your CompafTes in the Point 6c, or F, of the Quadrant NE, and extend 
the other to the Point 60, or D, in the Diameter NS ; then defcribe the little Arcs A, B, 
and removing the Foot of your CompafTes to the Point D, defcribe two other Arcs, cutting 
thofe before defcribed, and thro' the Points of Interferon draw a right Line, which will 
cut the Diameter C N, produced in the Point G, the Center of the 60th Parallel. Having 
thus found the Centers of all the Parallels, and drawn them in the Northern Hemifphere, 
transfer the central Points in the Line C N continued, into the Line C S continued alfo, 
and draw the Parallels of the Southern Flemifphere. Note, That whether the polar Papers 
extend to the 80th or 70th Parallel, thofe Circles in the meridional Papers, or thofe that 
encompafs the Body of the Globe, rauft be defcribed as is here ordered ; but in the polar 
Papers the Pole mult be the Center, as you fee in the Figure, where one Point of the Com- 
pafTes being fet in the South Pole S, and the other extended to the 80th or 70th Degree of 
Latitude in the Diameter, ftrikes thofe Parallels in the polar Papers. See more concerning 
the polar Papers hereafter. 

Then becaufe the polar Circles and Tropicks are but Parallels 23 Dcg. 30 Min. diftant 
from the Poles and Equator -, at thofe Diftances defcribe double Lines, reprefenting fuch 
Circles, to diftinguifh them from other Parallels. 

To draw the Meridians. 
Having chofen one of the Proportions beforementioned for the Breadth of each Paper on 
the Equator, fuppofe r \ of the Equator, which is the common Proportion in globical Pa- 
pers, and the greatcft Breadth that can be allowed them, let the Globe be of what Magni- 
tude foever : then becaufe r ' r of the Equator contains 30 Degrees, which in the Gores 
for a Globe of 72 Inches Circumferences, are fix Inches in Breadth •, from a Scale or Inches 
take three Inches between your CompafTes, and lay them olfon the Diameter W C E, from 
C to K, and from C to I, the Length from I to K being fix Inches, or 3 Degrees of the 
Equator, into which it muft be divided, and numbered at each 5th or 10th Degree, with the 
Degrees of Longitude. 

Now 



Chap.

of the Globes. 



179 



Now becaufe a fingle Degree cannot be well divided into Parts in fo fmall a Projection, 
and feeing that any Number of Degrees of Longitude in any Parallel has the fame Propor- 
tion to one Degree in that Parallel, as the fame Number of Degrees of Longitude under 
the Equator has to one Degree of Longitude j therefore take 15 Degrees of the Equator, 
viz- IC or IK, in your CompafTes, and having divided it feparately, as you would a fin- 
ale Degree, into 60 equal Parts, look irt the following Table what Proportion a Degree 
(or 15 Degrees) in each 5th or 10th Parallel of Latitude* hath to a Degree (or 15 Degrees) 
on the Equator. For example, in the firft Column of the Table towards the Left-Hand, 
are the Degrees of Latitude; over againft the 10th Degree, I find 59 Miles in the fecond 
Column, and 00 Minutes, or Fractions of a Mile, in the third Column, which fignifies that 
a Decree (or 15 Degrees) in the 10th Parallel of Latitude, contains but 59 Milts 00 Mi- 
nutcs^of a Degree (or 15 Degrees of the Equator) which Length I take from the Scale I C 
or CK between my Compaiies, and fet off on each fide the Meridian, or Diameter N S, 
on the 10th Parallel. 

A^ain, in the Parallel of 20 Degrees, I find a Degree to contain 56 Miles 24 Minutes, or 
parts of a Mile, of a Degree in the Equator, and transfer that Length from the aforefaid 
Scale upon the 20th Parallel ; the like is to be underftood of all the reft, and thofe Points 
being found and joined, will form the Meridians on the Gores. The fame Directions muft 
be followed in all other Proportions for the Breadth cf the Gores; in chufing of which, ob- 
ferve, that as it is manifeft from the Figure of the Globe, that a Paper fo large as .'- of 
the Circumference of the Globe, cannot lie upon its Convexity, without crumbling, lapping 
over, or tearing, in the Application; therefore it will be better to ufe fome leffer Propor- 
tion, as L M, ab, or cd: for note, the narrower they are, the more exactly they will fit 
jthe Globe. Note alio, in drawing the Parallels from 10 to 30 Degrees of Latitude, right 
Lines will do well enough.

T#£ exatl Geometrical IV ay of drawing the Parallels and Meridians on the Gores- 

Becaufe in the Method before laid down, the true Centers of the Parallels are not exact- Plate 1! 
ly in thofe Points found as there directed ; nor the Points in them the Points by which the Fig 1. 
Meridians muft pafs: therefore I think it proper here to exhibit the Geometrical Manner 
of drawing them truly. 

Suppofe SB to be the Semidiameter of the Globe, with which defcribe the Quadrant BI, 
and continue out the Semidiameter S I, both ways. Make S A equal to 4 of the Circum- 
ference ; the Point A of which, will be the Pole of the Gore. Then divide the Quadrant 
BI into 90 equal Parts or Degrees, to every of which draw the Tangents i 80, k 70, I 6o t 
m go, &amp;c. until they meet the Radius SI continued. Again, having divided the Line AS 
(equal to ; of the Circumference of the Globe) into 90 equal Parts, (I have only divided it 
into 9) and numbred them as per Figure; take the Length of the Tangent i 80 between 
your Compaffes, and fetting one Foot in the Point 80 of the Line AS, the other will fall 
upon the Point a in the faid Line continued out beyond A, which will be the Center of the 
80th Parallel parting thro' the Point 80 in the Line A S. 



Moreover, 



1 80 T'hc Conjlruciion and Ufes Book VI. 

Moreover, to find the Center of the 70th Parallel, take the Tangent k 70 between your 
Compaffes, and fetting one Foot in the Point 70 of the Line A S, the other will fall on the 
Point b in the Line AS continued, which will be the Center of" the 70th Parallel, paffing 
thro' the Point 80 in the Line AS. 

In like manner, to find the Center of the 60th Parallel, take the Tangent / 60 between 
your Compacts, and fet it off from the Point 60 in the Line A S, and you will have the 
Center c for the 60th Parallel, paffing thro' the Point 60. Proceed thus for finding the Cen- 
ters d, e t /, g, &amp;V. of the Parallels 50, 40, 30, 20, &amp;c. about each of which Centers refpec- 
tive Arcs being drawn, the Parallels will be had. 

The Reafon of this Operation for finding the Centers of the Parallels, is this ; If a 
Sphere or Globe hath revolved upon a Plane, in fuch manner that every Point of the Peri- 
phery of fome leffer Circle of it, has touched the faid Plane, and the Point which in the 
beginning of the Motion was contiguous to the Plane, became to be contiguous to it again ; 
then the Points on the Plane, that were contiguous to the Points of the Periphery of the 
aforefaid leffer Circle, will be in the Circumference of a Circle, whofe Center will be the 
Vertex of a right Cone, lying on the aforefaid Plane, the ifafe of which will be the faid 
Circle j and confequently the Vertex will be determined in the Plane, by continuing a right 
Line raifed on the Circle's Center perpendicularly 'till it cuts the aforefaid Plane. 

How to draw the Meridians. 

Having drawn the Sines 10^, 205-, 30 r, 40 s, &amp;c. divide the Radius BS into 360 
equal Parts, or make a Diagonal Scale of that Length, whereby 360 may be taken off. 
Then having affumed SC for half the Breadth of the Gore, fuppofe ,' T of the Circumfe- 
rence of the Equator, take S x (the Sine Complement of 80 Deg.) between your Com paries, 
and applying this Extent on the Radius B S, or the Diagonal Scale, fee how many of thofe 
Parts that the Diameter is divided into, that Extent takes up. Then take ~ v of thofe 
Parts, and with the Quotient as fo many Degrees make the Arc 10 L off, which will give 
the Point I. in the Parallel of 10 Degrees, thro' which the Meridian muft pafs. 

Again, take S w between your Compaffes, and fee how many of the Parts that the Radius 
B S is divided into, it contains ; then take T ' T of thofe Parts, and with the Quotient, as fo 
many Degrees, make the Arc 20 M off, which will give another Point M, thro' which the 
lame Meridian muff pafs in the 20th Parallel. 

In like manner, to find the Point N in the Parallel of 30 Degrees, thro' which the Meri- 
dian muft pafs, take S u (the Sine Complement of 60 Degrees) in your Compaffes, and fee 
how many of the Parts that the Radius BS is divided into, it contains ; then taking - + -\. of 
thofe Parts, with the Quotient as fo many Degrees, make the Arc 30 N off. 

Proceeding in this manner, you may find other Points in the other Parallels, thro' which 
the Meridian mud pafs. Which Points being afterwards joined, the quarter of the Meri- 
dian ANC will be drawn; and therefore one quarter of the Gore •, and confequently the 
other three Quarters of the Gore will be eafily limited. 

Method of ordering the Circumsolar Papers. 
The Circumpolar Papers were formerly not cut out by themfelves, 'till Artifts found it hard 
to make the Poles, or Points of the Gores, fall nicely in the North and South Poles ; whence, 
to help that Inconveniency, they made Circular Papers ferve to cover the Superficies of thq 
Globe between the Polar Circles, the Parallels on which Papers are all Concentric Circles, 
and the Meridians Right Lines: yet finding dill fo big Papers not to fit the Globe's Con- 
vexity, but wrinkle about the edges, they have extended them from the Poles only to the 
Parallels of 70 Degrees. But neither will it do yet, bccaule the Longitude decreafes dif- 
proportionally, the further off the Poles. If the Diameter of a Polar Paper extends to 
in Degrees from the Pole only, that Paper will lie flat upon the Globe's Convexity, without 
any fenfible dretching or contracting : But if it extend to or beyond the 70th Parallel, you 
mud take another Courfe. 
w:, r 7 . Suppofe A PB to be half of a Gore, 12 of which will cover a Globe. About the Poi^t P 

with an extent to the 70th Parallel, defcribe a Circle, which from the Points G or F, 
divide into 12 equal Parts-, or, which is the fame, continue every other Meridian in the 
Parallel 80 to the Parallel 70, and by the aforementioned Table fet off on each Side thefe 
12 Meridians, the true Longitude of each 10 Degrees in the Parallel of 80 •, or, which 
will fave that trouble, transfer the Didance from C to G, or from G to D upon the Pa- 
rallel of 70 Deg. in the Polar Paper, for that is the extent of 10 Degrees in that Parallel ; 
and, as is manifed from the Figure, there will lie between each twelfth part of the Circum- 
ference FG, a narrow flip of Paper which mud be cut out, and then the Paper being laid 
upon the Globe, the Parts will naturally clofe : whereas, for want of this Care taken, we 
commonly fee the Polar Papers wrap over and wrinkle ; befides, the Points of the Meridians 
on the Polar Papers feldom meet thofe of the Meridians of the Gores, except now and 
then by chance. 

From this one rough Draught you may transfer the red of the Gores that are to make 
up the Surface of the Globe ; by which the trouble of projecting a New Scheme for every

Gore will be avoided. Obferve to do it with great care, For a fmall Error will, when the 
Gores are all joined, appear very fenfible. Then becaufe the Gores in all make 12, you mav 
divide your Proje&amp;ions upon three Sheets of large Paper, allowing four Gores to each Sheet 

Draw an Eaft and Weft Diameter thro' every Sheet, in each of which fet off the Diftance Fi 
from I to K, of Fig. 7. Plate 17. with your Compafles four times, without fliiftino- the 
Points. In the middle of each ereft Perpendiculars, and transfer 70 Degrees thereon (al- 
lowing the Polar Papers to include 20 Degrees from the Poles) Northwards and South- 
wards from the Center, which is the Interferon of the Equator with theftraight Meridians 
or Perpendiculars, for Northern and Southern Latitude. 

From the aforefaid Semi-gore, take the Diftance between the Point of each 10th Parallel 
in the Perpendiculars, and in the Meridians AC, B D, and in the fair Draught defcribe Arcs 
to the Right and Left, upon the Points in the Perpendiculars. 

Then placing one foot of your Compafles in the Point A or B, extend the other to the 
Point of the Meridians and Parallels Interferon ; and as you go alone-, transfer the Di- 
ftances upon the Copies from the correfpondent Points of the Equator into the Arcs, and the 
Places where they cut will be the Points thro' which the Meridians and Parallels mull be 
drawn. And that Meridian, among all the Papers which is pitched upon for the firft, let be 
divided equally from the Equator to G, and then in the Polar Papers to the Poles, into De- 
grees or Minutes, numbering each 10th or 5th Degree, with the Degrees of Latitude, mind- 
ing to draw three Lines to diftinguilh it from other Meridians. The fame mull be obferved in 
defcribing the Ecliptick or Equator; on which laft every 5th or 10th Degree, 'till you 
come to 180 Degrees, muft be figured Eaftward and Weftward from the firft Meridian. 

When all the Papers are finifhed fo far as relates to the Meridians and Parallels, you muft 
next draw the Ecliptick •, and becaufe that Circle interfe&amp;s the Meridians in fuch and fuch 
Parallels of Declination, and the Meridians cut the Equator in the Degrees of Right 
Afcenfion •, therefore by help of a Table of the Declination of thofe Points of the Ecliptick 
that cut the Meridian, and the Right Afcenfion of the fame Points, find the Declination 
over-agamft the Right Afcenfion, which fhews thro' what parts of the Meridians the Ecliptick 
Arcs muft pafs ; and draw Right Lines thro' the Points of Interferon, which Lines will form 
the Ecliptick on the Globe;

CHAP. II. 

Of Aflronomical and Geographical Definitions^ and the Ufes 

of the Globes. 

BEfore I lay down the Ufes of the Globe, it will be proper to exhibit the following De- 
finitions, neceflary to be known in order to underftand their Ufes. 

Definition I. The Latitude of any Place, is an Arc of the Meridian of that Place, intercepted 
between the Zenith and the Equator ; and this is the fame as an Arc of the Meridian inter- 
cepted between the Pole and the Horizon •, and therefore the Latitude of any Place is often 
cxprefTed by the Pole's Height, or Elevation of the Pole : the Reafon of which is, that from 
the Equator to the Pole, there always being the Diftance of 90 Degrees, and from the Ze- 
nith to the Horizon the fame Number, and each of thefe 90 containing within it the Di- 
flance between the Zenith and the Pole ; that Diftance therefore being taken away from 
both, muft leave the Diftance from the Zenith to the Equator equal to the Diftance between 
the Pole and the Horizon, or the Elevation of the Pole above the Horizon. 

Definition II. Latitude of a Star or Planet, is an Arc of a great Circle reckoned on the 
Quadrant of Altitude, laid through the Star and Pole of the Ecliptick, from the Ecliptick 
towards its Pole. 

Definition III. Longitude of a Place is an Arc of the Equator intercepted between the 
Meridian •, or it is more properly the Difference, either Eaft or Weft, between the Meridians 
of any two Places, accounted on the Equator. 

Definition IV. Longitude of a Star, is an Arc of the Ecliptick, accounted from the be- 
ginning of Aries to the Place where the Star's Circle of Longitude croffeth the Ecliptick ; fo 
that it is much the lame as the Star's Place in the Ecliptick, accounted from the beginning of 
Aries. 

Definition V. Amplitude of the Sun or of a Star, is an Arc of the Horizon intercepted be- 
tween the true Eaft or Weft Points of it, and that Point upon which the Sun or Star rifes 
or fets. 

Definition VI. Right Afcenfion of the Sun, or of a Star, is that part of the Equinoctial 
reckoned from the beginining of Aries, which rifeth or fetteth with the Sun or Star in a 
Right Sphere : but in an Oblique Sphere it is that part of a Degree of the Equinoctial, 
which comes to the Meridian with it, (as before) reckoned from the beginning of Aries. 

Definition VII. A right or direct Sphere, is when the Poles are in the Horizon, and the 
Equator in the Zenith: the Confequence of being under fuch a Pofition of the Heavens as 
this (which is the cafe of thofe who live directly under the Line) is, that the Inhabitants 
have no Latitude nor Elevation of the Pole ; they can nearly fee both the Poles of the 
World. All the Stars in the Heaven do once in twenty-four Hours rife, culminate, and 
fet with them ; the Sun always rifes and dtfeends at Right Angles with the Horizon, 
which is the Reafon they have always equal Days and Nights, becaufe the Horizon doth 
exactly bifect the Circle of the Sun's Diurnal Revolution. 

Definition VIII. A Parallel Sphere, is where the Poles are in the Zenith and Nadir, and 
the Equinoctial in the Horizon •, which is the Cafe of fuch Perfons, if any fuch there be, 
who live directly under the North or South Poles. 

And the Confequence of fuch a Pofition are, that the Parallels of the Sun's Declination 
will alio be Parallels of his Altitude, or Almacanters to them. The Inhabitants can fee 
only fuch Stars as are on their fide the Equinoctial; and they muft have fix Months Day, 
and fix Months continual Night every Year •, and the Sun can never be higher with them 
than 23 Degrees, 30 Minutes, which is not fo high as it is with us on February the 10th. 

Definition IK. An oblique Sphere, is where the Pole is elevated to any Number of De- 
grees lefs than 90 : and confequently the Axis of the Globe can never be at Right Angles 
to, nor in the Horizon -, and the Equator and Parallels of Declination, will all cut the Ho- 
rizon obliquely, from whence it takes its Name. 

Oblique Afcenfion of the Sun or Stars, is that Part or Degree of the Equinoctial reckon- 
ed from the beginning of Aries, which rifes and fets with them in an oblique Sphere. 

Afcenfional Difference, is the Difference between the right and oblique Afcenfion, when 
the leffer is fubftracted from the greater. 

On the Terreflrial Globe. 
Definition X. A Space upon the Surface of the Earth, reckoned between two Parallels to 
the Equator, wherein the Increafe of the longeft Day is a quarter of an Hour, is by fome 
Writei s called a Parallel. 

* Definition 



Chap. 2 . Aftronomical and Geographical Definitions* 183 

Definition XI. And the Space contained between two fuch Parallels, is called a Climate: 
Thefe Climates begin at the Equator ; and when we go North or South, till the Day becomes 
half an Hour longer than it was before, they fay we are come into the firft Climate ; when 
the Days are an Hour longer than they are under the Equator, we are come to the Second 
Climate, &amp;c thefe Climates are counted in Number 24, reckoned each way from the Poles. 
" The Inhabitants of the Earth are divided into three forts, as to the falling of their 

Shadows. 

Definition XII. Amphifcii, who are thofe which inhabit the Torrid Zone, or live between 
the Equator and Tropicks, and confequently have the Sun twice a Year in their Zenith ; 
at which time they are Afcii^ i. e. have no Shadows, the Sun being vertical to them : thefe 
have their Shadows call to the Southward, when the Sun is in the Northern Signs, and to 
the Northward when the Sun is in the Southern Signs reckoned in refpect of them. 

Definition Xill. Heterofcii, who are thofe whofe Shadows fall but one way, as is the Cafe 
of all fuch as live between the Tropicks and Polar Circles ; for their Shadows at Noon are 
always to the Northward in North Latitude, and to the Southward in South La- 



titude. 



Definition XIV. Peri frit, are fuch Perfons that inhabit thofe Places of the Earth that lie 
between the Polar Circles andthe Poles, and therefore have their Shadows falling all manner 
of ways, becaufe the Sun at fome time of the Year goes clear round about them. The 
Inhabitants of the Earth, in refpect to one another, are alio divided into three Sorts. 

Periceceiy who are fuch as inhabiting the lame Parallel (not a great Circle), are yet directly 
oppofite to one another, the one being Eaft or Weft from the other exactly 180 Degrees, 
which is their Difference of Longitude. Now thefe have the fame Latitude and Length 
of Days and Nights, but exactly at contrary Times ; for when the Sun rifeth to one, it fets 
to the other. 

Antceci, who are Inhabitants of fuch Places, as being under a Semi-circle of the fame 
Meridian, do lie at equal Diftance from the Equator, one towards the North, and the other 
towards the South. Now thefe have the fame Degree of Latitude, but towards contrary 
Parts, the one North and the other South ; and therefore muft have the Seafons of the Year 
directly at contrary Times one to the other. 

Antipodes, who are fuch as dwell under the fame Meridian, but in two oppofite and equi- 
diftant Parallels, and in the two oppofite Points of thofe two Parallels •, fo that they go 
Feet againft Feet, and are diftant from each other an intire Diameter of the Earth, or 180 
Degrees of a great Circle. Thefe have the fame Degree of Latitude, but the one South, 
the other North, and accounted from the Equator a quite contrary way ; and therefore 
thefe will have all things, as Day and Night, Summer and Winter, directly contrary to 
one another. 

U S E I. To find the Latitude of any Place. 

Bring the Place to the Brafs Meridian, and the Degrees of that Circle, intercepted between 
the Place and the Equinoctial, are the Latitude of that Place either North or South. 

Then to fit the Globe fo that the wooden Horizon fhali reprefent the Horizon of that 
Place, elevate the Pole as many Degrees above the wooden Horizon, as are contain'd in the 
Latitude of that Place, and it is done •, for then will that Place be in the Zenith. 

If after this you rectify the Globe to any particular time, you may by the Index know 
the time of Sun-rifing and Setting with the Inhabitants of that Place, and confequently the 
prefent Length of their Day and Night, £sfV. 

USE II. To find the Longitude of a Place. 

Bring the Places feverally to the Brafs Meridian, and then the Number of Degrees of 
the Equinoctial, which are between the Meridians of each Place, are their Difference of 
Longitude either Eaft or Weft. 

But if you reckon it from any Place where a firft Meridian is fuppofed to be placed, you 
muft bring the firft Meridian to the Brazen one on the Globe ; and then turn the Globe 
about 'till the other Place comes thither alfo : reckon the Number of Degrees of the Equi- 
noctial intercepted between the firft Meridian, and the proper one of the Place, and that is 
the Longitude of that Place, either Eaft or Weft. 

USE III. To find what Places of the Earth the Sun is Vertical to, at any time affigned. 

Bring the Sun's Place found in the Ecliptick on the Terreftrial Globe to the brazen Meri- 
dian, and note what Degree of the Meridian it cuts ; then by turning the Globe round 
about, you will fee what Places of the Earth are in that Parallel of Declination (for they 
will all come fuccefiively to that Degree of the brazen Meridian) ; and thofe are the Places 
and Parts of the Earth to which the Sun will be Vertical that Day, whofe Inhabitants will 
then be Afcii ; that is, their erect Bodies at Noon will eaft no Shadow. 

Of 



1 84 the ConftruSiion and Ufes Book VI, 

Of the Celejlial Globe. 

USE IV. To find the Sun's place in the Ecliptick in any given Day of the Month, by means 
of the Circle of Signs on the wooden Horizon. 
Seek the Day of the Month upon the Horizon, obferving the Difference between the 
Julian and Gregorian Calendars ; and then againft the laid Day you will find, in the Circle of 
Signs, the Sign and Degree the Sun is in the faid Day. This being done, find the fame 
Sign and Degree upon the Ecliptick on the Superficies of the Globe, and the Sun's place 
will be had. Note, If the Sun's place be required more exactly, you muft confult an Ephe- 
meris for the given Year, or elfe calculate it from Aftronomical Tables. 

U S E V. The Sun's Place for any Day being given, to find his Declination. 
Bring the Sun's Place for that Day to the Meridian, and then the Degrees of the Meri- 
dian, reckoned from the Equinoctial either North or South to the faid Place, fliew the 
Sun's Declination for that Day at Noon, either North or South, according to the time of 
the Year, viz. from March the 10th to September the 12th, North ; and from thence to March 
again, South. 

USE VI. To find the Sun's Amplitude either Rijing or Setting. 
Having rectified the Globe to the Latitude of the Place, that is, moved the brazen Me- 
ridian 'till the Degree of the Latitude thereon be cut by the Plane of the wooden Horizon, 
bring the Sun's Place to the faid Horizon either on the Eafb or Weft fide, and the Degrees 
of the Horizon, reckoned from the Eaft Point, either North or South, give the Amplitude 
fought, and at the fame time you have in the Circle of Rhumbs the Point that the Sun rifes 
or fets upon. 

USE VII. To find the Sun's Right Afcenfion. 

Bring the Sun's Place to the brazen Meridian, and the Degrees intercepted between the 
beginning of Aries, and that Degree of the Equinoctial which comes to the Meridian with 
the Sun, is the Right Afcenfion ; which if you would have in time, you muft reckon every 
15 Degrees for one Hour, and every Degree four Minutes. 

Note, The Reafon of bringing the Sun's place to the Meridian in this Ufe, is to fave the 
trouble of putting the Globe into the Pofition of a Right Sphere : for properly Right 
Afcenfion is that Degree of the Equinoctial, which rifes with the Sun in a Right Sphere. But 
fince the Equator is always at Right Angles to the Meridian, if you bring the Sun's place 
thither, it muft in the Equinoctial cut his Right Afcenfion. 

USE VIII. To find the Sun's Oblique Afcenfion. 
Having rectified the Globe to the Latitude, bring the Sun's Place to the Eaft-fide of the 
Horizon, and the Number of Degrees intercepted between that Degree of the Equinoctial, 
which is now come to the Horizon and the beginning of Aries, is the Oblique Afcenfion. 
Now the leffer of thefe two Afcenfions being taken from the greater, the Remainder is 
the afcenfional Difference •, which therefore is the Difference in Degrees between the Right 
or Oblique Afcenfion, or the Space between the Sun's Rifing or Setting, and the Hour of 
fix. Wherefore the afcenfional Difference being converted into Time, will give the time of 
the Sun's Rifing and Setting before or after fix. 

USE IX. To find the time of the Sun's Rifing or Setting in any given Latitude. 
Having firft brought his Place to the Meridian, and the Hour-Index to twelve at Noon, 
bring his Place afterwards to the Horizon, either on the Eaft or Weft-fide thereof ; then the 
Hour Index will either fhew the time of his Rifing and Setting accordingly. Now the time 
of the Sun's Setting being doubled, gives the Length of the Day ; and the time of his Ri- 
fing doubled, gives the Length of the Night. 

USE X. The find the Sun's Meridian Altitude, or Depreffion at Midnight, in any given 

Latitude. 

Bring his Place to the Meridian above the Horizon, for his Noon Altitude, which will 
fhew the Degrees thereof, reckoning from the Horizon ; and to find his midnight Depreffion 
below the North Point of the Horizon, the Point in the Ecliptick oppofite to the Sun's 
prefent Place, muft be brought to the South part of the Meridian above the Horizon, 
and the Degrees there intercepted between that Point and the Horizon, are his midnight 
Depreffion. 

USE XI. To find the Sun's Altitude at any time of the Day given. 
Rectify the Globe, that is, bring the Sun's Place to the Meridian, and fct the Hour- 
Index to twelve, and raife the Pole to the Latitude of the Place above the Horizon. This 
being done, fit the Quadrant of Altitude, that is, fcrew the Quadrant of Altitude to 
^ the 



Chap. 2. of the Globes. 185 

the Zenith, or in our Latitude fcrew it fo that the divided Edge cuts 51 Deg. 32 Min. otl 
the Meridian reckoned from the Equinoctial. Then turn the Globe about 'till the Index 
(hews the given Time, and ftay the Globe there; after which, bring the Quadrant of Alti- 
tude to cut the Sun's Place in the Ecliptick, and then that Place or Degree of the Ecliptick 
will fhew the Sun's Altitude on the Quadrant of Altitude. 

USE XII. To find the Sun's Altitude, and at what Hour he is due Eaft or Weft. 
Rectify the Globe, and fit the Quadrant of Altitude. Then bring the Quadrant to cut 
the true Eaft Point, and turn the Globe about 'till the Sun's Place in the Ecliptick cuts 
the divided Edge of the Quadrant of Altitude ; for then that Place will fhew the Altitude* 
and the Index the Hour. 

USE XIII. The Sun's Azimuth, or when he is on any Point of the Compafs being given j 
to find his Altitude and the Hour of the Day. 
Set the Quadrant of Altitude to the Azimuth given, and turn the Globe about 'till his 
place in the Ecliptick touches the divided Edge of the Quadrant •, fo fhall that Place give 
the Altitude on the Quadrant, and the Hour-Index the Time of the Day. 

USE XIV. To find the Declination, and the Right Afcenfion of any Star. 
Bring the Star to the brazen Meridian, and then the Degrees intercepted between the 
Equinoctial and the Point of the Meridian cut by the Star, gives its Declinations. And 
the Meridian cuts, and fhews its Right Afcenfion on the Equinoctial, reckoning from the 
beginning of Aries. 

USE XV. To find the Longitude and Latitude of any Star. 
Bring the Soliftitial Colure to the brazen Meridian, and there fix the Globe ; then will the 
Pole of the Ecliptick be juft under 23 Deg. 30 Min. reckoning from the Pole above the North 
Point of the Horizon, and upon the fame Meridian •, there fcrew the Quadrant of Altitude, 
and then bring its graduated Edge to the Star affigned, and there ftay it : fo will the Star 
cut its proper Latitude on the Quadrant, reckoned from the Ecliptick ; and the Quadrant 
will cut the Ecliptick in the Star's Longitude, or its Diftance from the firft Point of 
Aries. 

USE XVI. To find the time of any Star's rifing, fetting, or culminating, that is, being 

on the Meridian. 

Rectify the Globe, and Hour-Index, and bring the Star to the Eaft or Weft part of the 
Horizon, or to the brazen Meridian, and the Index will fhew accordingly the Time of the 
Star's rifing, fetting, or culminating, or of its being on the Meridian. 

USE XVII. To know, at any time affigned, what Stars are rifing or fetting, which are on the 
Meridian, and how high they are above the Horizon ; on what Azimuth or Point of the Compafs 
they are ; by which means the real Stars in the Heaven may eafily be known by their proper 
Names, and rightly diftinguifhed from one another. 

Rectify the Globe, and fit the Quadrant of Altitude, and fet the Globe, by means of 
the Compafs, due North and South •, then turn the Globe and Hour-Index to the Hour of 
the Night affigned ; fo will the Globe, thus fixed, reprefent the Face or Appearance of the 
Heavens for that time: whereby you may readily fee what Stars are in or near the Hori- 
zon ; what are on or near the Meridian ; which are to the North, or which to the South, 
&amp;c. and the Quadrant of Altitude being laid over any particular Star, will fhew its Al- 
titude and Azimuth, or on what Point of the Compafs it is, whereby any Star may eafily 
be known ; efpecially if you have a Quadrant to take the Altitude of any real Star fuppofed 
to be known by the Globe, to fee whether it agrees with that Star which is its Reprefen- 
tative on the Globe or not. 

USE XVIII. The Sun's Place given, as alfo a Star's Altitude, to find the Hour of the 

Night. 
Rectify the Globe, and fit the Quadrant of Altitude ; then move the Globe backwards 
or forwards, till the Quadrant cuts the Star in its given Altitude : for then the Hour-Index 
will frew the Hour of the Night. And thus may the Hour of the Night be known by a 
Star's Azimuth, or its Azimuth by its Altitude. 

USE XIX. To find the Diftance between any two Stars. 
If the Stars lie both under the fame Meridian, bring them to the brazen Meridian, and 
the Degrees of the faid Meridian comprehended between them, are their Diftance. 

If they are both in the Equinoctial, or have both the fame Declination, that is, are both 
in the fame Paraiiei, then bring them one after another to the brazen Meridian, and the De- 
grees of tiie Equinoctial intercepted between them, when thus brought to the Meridian fe- 
verally, are their Diftance.

1 86 ^be Conflruciion and Ufes Book VI. 

If the Stars are neither under the fame Meridian or Parallel, then either lay the Quadrant 
of Altitude from one to the other (if it will reach), and that will fhew the Diftance between 
them in Degrees ; or eife take the Diftance with CompafTes, and apply that to the Equi- 
noctial, or to the Meridian. 

This Method of Proceeding will alfo fhew the Diftance of any two Places on the Terre- 
ftrial Globe in Degrees. Wherefore to find how far any Place on the Globe is from another, 
you need only take the Diftance between them on the Globe with a Pair of CompafTes, and 
applying the CompafTes to the Equator at the Beginning of Aries, or at the firft Meridian, 
you will there find the Degrees of their Diftance, which multiplied by 70 (or 6y T \&gt; Englijh 
Miles), and that will be their Diftance in Miles.

SPHERES. 

SECTION I. 

Of the Ptolemaick Sphere. 

Fig. 3. PTT^ H E third Figure of Plate 18, reprefents a Ptolemaick Armillary Sphere, made of 

Brafs, or Wood, confiding of the fame Circles that have been defcribed in Chapter I. 
aforegoing, and having a round Ball fixed in the Middle thereof, upon the Axis of the 
World, reprefenting the Earth. Upon the Surface of this Ball are drawn Meridians, Pa- 
rallels, &amp;c. as likewife as many Kingdoms, Countries, Seas, &amp;c. with their Names, as can 
conveniently be depicted thereon. This Sphere revolves about the faid Axis, between the 
Meridian, and by this means not only fhews the Sun's diurnal and annual Courfe, &amp;c. about 
the Earth, according to the Ptolemaick Hypothefis, which fuppofes the Earth to be at reft, 
and the Sun to move about the fame •, but likewife by it any Problem relating to the Sun, 
may be folved, that can be done by the Globes. And this any one that knows the Ufe of 
the Globes may likewife do. 

SECTION II. 

Of the common Copernican Sphere. 

Fig. 4. This Sphere ftands upon four brafs or wooden Feet, upon each of which are fixed the four 

Ends of a brafs or wooden Crofs, upon which Crofs is fattened a large hollow brafs or v/ooden 
Circle, whofe Center is exactly over the Center of the Crofs. Upon the upper Plane of this 
Circle are the Calendars, and Circle of Signs defcribed, the fame as on the Horizon of the 
Globes. Clofe within the Infide of this Circle is fitted a flat moveable Rundle, whofe Center 
is common with the Center of the Crofs. The outmoft Limb of this Rundle is divided into 
24 equal Parts, reprefenting the 24 Hours of Day and Night, numbered from the Index (of 
which more hereafter) towards the Right-hand with Numerical Letters from I to XII, and 
then beginning again with I, II, &amp;c. to XII again. 

There is a round Wheel fixed upon the Crofs, under the faid Rundle, whofe Convex Side 
is cut into a certain Number of Teeth. Thro' the Rundle, the Wheel on the Crofs, and the 
Crofs itfelf, is fitted a perpendicular Axis, about which the Rundle moves. This reprefents 
part of the Axis of the Ecliptick, and at the Top thereof is placed a little Golden Ball, re- 
prefenting the Sun. 

On the under Side of the moveable Rundle moves another Wheel, whofe Convex Side is 
cut into Teeth, and as the Rundle is turned about upon it's Center, this Wheel is alfo turn- 
ed about upon it's Center, by the falling in of the Teeth on that Wheel fixed on the Crofs. 
Likewife near the outmoft Limb of the Rundle is fitted another Wheel, into which is fitted 
a Pedeftal, holding up a Sphere of feveral Parts, having a Terreftrial Globe inclofed therein, 
as fhall be fhewn hereafter. The outmoft Limb of this Wheel is likewife cut into Teeth, 
fitted into the Teeth of the fixed Wheel ; and fo as the Rundle moves round, this Wheel 
is carried about, and with it likewife the Earth, and all the Circles faftened upon the afore- 
faid Pedeftal. 

On one Side of this Rundle is faftened a little round Pin to turn about the Rundle by, 
and near this Pin, is an Index upon the Rundle, reaching to the outward Limb of the 
great hollow Circle, and fo at once may be applied to the Day of the Month in both Ca- 
lendars, and alfo to the Degree of the Ecliptick the Sun is in that Day at Noon. Note, 
This Index is called the Index of the moveable Rundle. On each Side of the Crofs is placed 
a Pillar, fupporting a broad Circle, reprefenting the Zodiack, with the Ecliptick in the 

Middle 



Chap. 3. of Spheres. 187 

Middle thereof, as in the Ptolemaick Sphere. Note, This is called the Zodiack, in the Ufe 

of the Sphere. 

Upon the aforefaid Pedeftal are fattened two Circles cutting each other at Right Angles, 
reprcfenting the two Colures fo placed, that the Points wherein they interfect each other 
ftand directly upwards and downwards, and reprefent the Poles of the Ecliptick, the upper- 
moft being the North, and the other the South. One of thefe Colures, viz. the Solftitial, 
hath a fmall Hour-Circle placed thereon, at the Extremity of the Axis of the Earth. In the 
Middle, between the two Poles of the Ecliptick, is a Circle broader than the Colures, cut- 
ting them at Right Angles; and this reprcfents the Ecliptick, fo called in the Ufe of the 
Sphere, and is divided into Degrees, figured with the Names and Characters of the Signs, 
and having on the inward Edge thereof fcveral of the moil notable fixed Stars, with the 
Names affixed to them, and each Star placed to the Degree and Minute of Longitude there- 
on, that it hath in Heaven. 

Oblique to this Ecliptick 23 ; Degrees, on the Infide, is fitted a thin Circle, reprefent- 
incr the Equinoctial, and is divided into 360 Degrees, and having two parallel lelTer Circles 
at 23 ' Degrees equally diftant therefrom, reprefenting the Tropicks. On the Infule of all 
thefe Circles, two thin Semi-Circles (called Semi-Circles of Latitude) are fitted in the Poles of 
the Ecliptick, fo as one of them may move thro' one half the Ecliptick, viz. from Cancer 
thro' Aries to Capricorn \ and the other from Cancer thro' Libra to Capricorn : the lormer of 
thefe may be called the vernal Semi-Circle of Latitude, and the other the autumnal Semi- 
Circle of Latitude. On the Edge of thefe Semi-Circles are depicted the fame fixed Stars in 
their proper Longitude and Latitude, as are placed on the Ecliptick Circle aforefaid, with 
their feveral Names affixed to them. 

Thro' the folftitial Colure at 23 4- Degrees from each Pole of the Ecliptick, goes a Wire, 
reprefenting the Earth's Axis, having an Index placed on the End thereof, for pointing at 
the Hour, on the Hour-Circle placed on the folftitial Colure, as aforefaid. In the Middle of 
this Axis is fixed a round Ball, reprefenting the Earth, having Meridians, Parallels, &amp;c. and 
the Bounds of the Lands and Waters depicted thereon, as alfo the Names of as many Coun- 
tries and Towns as can be placed with conveniency thereon. And in two oppofite Points 
of the Equinoctial of this Ball, viz. 90 Degrees diftant from the firft Meridian, are fixed 
two fmall Pins, whereon* a moveable Horizon is placed, in the Eait and Weft Points thereof \ 
fo that thefe Pins ferve for an Axis to the Horizon : for on thefe Pins the Horizon may be 
elevated or deprefTed to any Degree the Pole is elevated above the Horizon. This Horizon 
Aides on the North and South Points, within a brazen Meridian, hung upon the Axis of the 
Earth. 

Round this Meridian, on the outmoft Side, is made a Groove, having a fmall brafs Ring fitted 
therein, fo as the upper Side thereof is even with the upper Side of the brazen Meridian. This 
fmall brafs Ring is fattened to two oppofite Points in the Horizon, viz. in the North and 
South, and fcrves as a Spring to keep it to the Degree of the Meridian you elevate the Hori- 
zon to. Upon two Pins on this fmall Ring, are likewife fattened two Semi-Circles of Altitude, 
yet not fo fattened, but that they may move as upon Centers, the one moving from North 
to South, thro' the Eaft-Side of the Horizon, and the .other the fame way thro' the Weft- 
Side. This Motion is performed upon the two Pins aforefaid, as upon two Poles, which 
they reprefent, viz. the Poles of the Horizon, and therefore are fo placed, that they may 
divide the upper and lower half of the Horizon into two equal Parts, and as the Horizon is 
moved, Aide always into the Zenith and Nadir, and fo become the Poles of the Horizon. 
Thefe two Semi-Circles of Altitude are divided into twice 90 Degrees, numbered at the Ho- 
rizon upwards and downwards, and ending at 90 in the Zenith and Nadir.

the Heavens for that Day at Noon. 

USE II. The Day of the Month being given, to find the Sun's Declination. 
Rectify the Earth's Place (according to Ufe I.) and then you will have the Sun's Place in 
the Zodiack •, then bring the Meridian to the Sun's Place in the Ecliptick on the Sphere ; 
and the Number of Degrees comprehended between the Equinodial and the Sun's Place, are 
the Sun's Declination for that Day at Noon. 

USE 



1 8 8 ^he ConftruSiion and Ufes Book VI. 

USE III. 'To find the Sun's Right or Oblique Afcenfion for any Day at Noon. 

Rectify the Earth's place to the Day of the Month, and bring the Meridian to the Sun's 
place in the Ecliptick •, and the Number of Degrees on the Equinoctial contained between 
the vernal Colure, and the Sun's place, are the Right Afcenfion fought. 

Now to find the Oblique Afcenfion, turn the Earth 'till the Eaft fide of the Horizon ftands 
againft the Sun, and the Degree of the Equinoctial then at the Horizon, fhews the Ob- 
lique Afcenfion. 

USE IV. To find the Sun's Meridian Altitude. 
Bring the Index of the Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Horizon to the 
Latitude of the Place. This being done, bring the Meridian to the Sun's place in the 
Ecliptick, and the Number of Degrees on the Meridian comprehended between the Horizon 
and the Sun's place, gives the Meridian Altitude fought. 

U S E V. To find the Sun's Altitude at any time of the Day. 
Bring the Index of the moveable Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Ho- 
rizon, and Hour-Index: then turn the Earth 'till the Hour-Index comes to the given Hour 
of the Day, and bring the vertical Circle to the Sun's place, and the Number of 
Degrees of the vertical Circle that tranfite the Sun's place, are his Altitude above the 
Horizon. 

USE VI. The Sun's Altitude being given, to find the Hour of the Day. 
Bring the Index of the Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Horizon and 
Hour-Index (as by[Ufe I.); then turn the Earth 'till the you can fit the Horizon to the given 
Altitude upon the vertical Circle, directly againft the Sun's place ; then the Hour-Index 
will give the Hour of the Day, refpect being had to the Morning or Afternoon. 

USE VII. To find at what Hour the Sun comes to the Eajl or Weft Points of the 

Horizon. 

Bring the Index of the moveable Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Ho- 
rizon and Hour-Index (as by Ufe I.).; then bring the vertical Circle to the Eaft Point of the 
Horizon, if it be the Sun's Eafting you enquire ; or to the Weft Point of the Horizon, 
if it be the Sun's Wefting. This being done, turn the Earth 'till the vertical Circle comes 
to the Sun's place ; then will the Index point to the Hour of the Day. 

USE VIII. To find the time of the Sun's rifing or fetting. 
Bring the Index of the moveable Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Ho- 
rizon, and Hour-Index, Then turn the Earth Eaftwards, 'till fome part of the Eaft-fide 
of the Horizon ftands directly againft the Sun's place ; then will the Hour-Index point to 
the time of the Sun's rifing. Again, Turn the Earth 'till fome part of the Weft-fide of the 
Horizon ftands directly againft the Sun's place, then the Index of the Hour-Circle will fhew 
the time of the Sun's letting. 

USE IX. The Hour of the Day given, to find the Sun's Azimuth. 
Bring the Index of the moveable Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Ho- 
rizon and Hour-Index. Then turn the Earth 'till the Hour-Index points to the Hour of 
the Day given. This being done, bring the vertical Circle to the Sun's place, and the 
Number of Degrees of the Horizon, that the vertical Circle cuts, counted from the Eaft 
Point, either Northwards or Southwards, are the Degrees of the Sun's Azimuth before 
Noon. Or the Number of Degrees of the Horizon that the vertical Circle cuts, counted 
from the Weft- fide of the Horizon, either Northwards or Southwards, give the Sun's 
Azimuth after Noon. 

USE X. To find in what Place of the Earth the Sun is in the Zenith, at any given time; 
as alfo in what fever al Places of the Earth the Sun jh all ft and in the Horizon at the fame time. 

Bring the Index of the moveable Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Hour- 
Index j then feek the Sun's Declination, and turn the Earth eaftwards 'till the Index points 
to the given Hour ; fo fhall the Number of Degrees of the Equinoctial that the Meridian 
palles thro' while the Earth is thus turning, be the Number of Degrees of Longitude, eaft- 
wards from your Habitation, the Place fhall have in the Parallel of the Sun's Declination. 

Now if you open a Pair of Calliper Compafles to 90 Degrees on the Equinoctial, and 
place one Foot in this Point of the Earth thus found, and turn the other Foot round 
about the Earth, all the Places that the Foot pafles thro' will at that time have the Sun in 
their Horizon. 

USE 



Chap. 3. of Spheres. 189 

USE XL How to find the true Places of the Stars on the Sphere j as likewife their Longitude 

and Latitude. 
Round the Plane of the Ecliptick, are placed feveral of the moil noted fixed Stars, ac- 
cording to their true Longitude ; and along the two Semi-circles of Latitude, are the fame 
Stars placed according to their Latitude from the Ecliptick. Whence if you would find the 
true place of any given Star in the Sphere ; Firft feek the Star in the Ecliptick, and like- 
wife the fame Star on one of the Semi-circles of Latitude, and bring the edge of that Semi- 
circle to the Star in the Ecliptick ; then will the Star on the Semi-circle of Latitude ftand in 
the fame Place and Situation on the Sphere, that it does in Heaven. 

USE XII. To find the Declination, right and oblique Afcenfion of a Star. 
Brinp- the proper Semi-circle of Latitude to the Star on the Ecliptick, and the Meridian 
to the Star on the Snni-circle of Latitude; and then the Number of Degrees on the Me- 
ridian, comprehended between the Equinoctial and the Star* are its Declination. Likewife 
the Decree of the Equator, cut by the Meridian, is the Star's right Afcenfion. But to 
find a°Star's oblique Afcenfion, rectify the Horizon (as by Ufe 1.) and bring the proper 
Semi-circle of Latitude to the Star in the Ecliptick, and turn the Eaft-fide of the Horizon 
to the Star ; then will the Degree of the Equator cut by the Horizon be the Star's oblique 
Afcenfion i 

USE XIII. To find the Time of the Riftng and Setting of any Star in any given Latitude. 

Brino- the Index of the moveable Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Ho- 
rizon and Hour Index; then bring the proper Semi-circle of Latitude to the Star on the 
Ecliptick, and the Eaft-fide of the Horizon to the Star; this being done, the Hour- 
Index will fliew the Hour the Star rifes at : and if you bring the Weft-fide of the 
Horizon to the Star, the Index of the Hour- Circle will fhew the Time that the Star 
fets. 

USE XIV. The Day of the Month, Hour of the Night, and Latitude of the Place being 
given, to know any remarkable Star obferved in the Heavens. 

Bring the Index of the moveable Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the Ho- 
rizon and Hour-Index ; then turn the Earth 'till the Index of the Hour-Circle comes to the 
Hour of the Night, and obferve the Altitude of the Star, and what Point of the Compafs 
it bears upon. Afterwards bring the vertical Circle to the fame Point of the Compafs, and 
number the Star's Altitude on the vertical Circle, and try with the Semi- circle of Latitude 
what Star you can fit to that Altitude, for that is the Star in the Heavens. 

USE XV. The Azimuth of any known Star being given, to find the Hour of the Nighty 

and Almicanter of that Star. 

Bring the Index of the moveable Rundle to the Day of the Month, and rectify the 
Horizon and Hour-Index ; afterwards bring the Star to its place, and the vertical Circle to 
its known Degree of Azimuth. This being done, turn the Earth 'till the vertical Circle 
comes to the Star; then the Index of the Hour-Circle will fliew the Hour of the Night, 
and the Degree of the vertical Circle cut by the Star will be its Almicanter. 

SECTION IV. 

The Dcfcription and Ufe of the Copernican Sphere, called the Orrery* 

The Outfide of this Inftrument, as appears by the figure thereof, is very beautiful, the pj a f e I( v 
Frame being of fine Ebony adorned with 12 Silver Pilafters, in the form of Caryatides ; and F i g . 1. 
with all the Signs of the Zodiuck caft of the fame Metal, and placed between them : the 
Handles arc alfo of Silver finely wrought, with very nice Joints. On the top of the Frame, 
which is exactly circular, is a broad Silver Ring, on which the Figures of the twelve Signs 
are exactly graved, with two Circles accurately divided ; one fhewing the Degrees of each 
Sign, and the other the Sun's Declination againft his place in the Ecliptick each Day at 
Noon. 

The aforefaid Silver Plate, reprefents the Plane of the great Ecliptick of the Heavens, 
or that of the Earth's annual Orbit round the Sun ; which, as it pafTes thro' the Center of 
the Sun, fo its Circumference is made by the Motion of the Earth's Center; and which, 
for the better advantage of View and Sight, is in the Figure placed parallel to the 
Horizon. 

S is a large gilded Ball, (landing up in the middle, whofe Support A B makes with 
the Plane of the Ecliptick an Angle of about 82 Degrees. This Support reprefents the 
Sun's Axis continued, about which he revolves in about 25 Days, and the Golden Ball re- 
prefents the Sun itfelf placed pretty near the Center of the Earth's Orbit j fo that 

C c c when 



1 9 o The Conftruciioti a nd Ufes B o o k V I . 

when the Inftrument is fet a-going, the Excentricity of the Earth, and the other Planets, 
may be in the fame Proportion as they are in the Heavens. 

The two little Balls M and V, which ftand upon two Wires at different Diftances from 
the Sun, reprefent Mercury and Venus : The reafon why they are placed upon the faid two 
"Wires, is only that their Centers may be fometimes in, and always pretty near the Plane of 
the great Ecliptick ; and this Pofition is contrived in order to fhew what Appearances they 
do really exhibit in their feveral Revolutions round the Sun. 

The Globe E is of Ivory, and reprefents the Earth. The Pin or Wire that fupports it, 
reprefents the Earth's Axis continued, and makes an Angle of 66 I Degrees, with the Plane 
of the Ecliptick. And as the Earth in each of her annual Revolutions round the Sun, 
always keeps her own Axis parallel to itfelf j fo when this Inftrument is fet a-going, the little 
Ivory Earth will likewife do fo too, in it's Revolution round the Golden Sun S. 

The little Ball m (landing upon a Wire, reprefents the Moon, and ab is a Silver Circle 
reprefenting her Orbit round about the Earth, the Plane whereof always paffes thro' the 
Center of the Earth ; and there are feveral Eigures graved upon it, fhewing the Moon's 
Age, from one New Moon to the other. 

One half of the Moon's Globe is white, and the other black, that fo her Phafes may be 
reprefented: for this Inftrument is fo contrived, that this little Moon will turn round it's 
own Axis, at the fame time as it moves in the Silver Orbit round the Earth E. 

The whole Movement, which confifts of near ioo Wheels, is covered by a great Brafs 
Plate, having a Hole in it, and there is a moveable Index on the Silver Ecliptick, on the 
former of which, are the common Solar Years denoted ; and by taking the Inftrument to 
'pieces, it may be fet to this prefent time ; and the Planets, by means of an Ephemeris, may 
be fet to any particular time alfo. So that if a Weight or Spring, as in a Clock, were ap- 
plied to the Axis of the Movement, fo as to make it move round once in juft twenty-four 
Hours, the reprefentative Planets in the Inftrument, viz. Mercury, Venus, the Earth, and 
the Moon, would all perform their Motions round the Sun, and one another, exactly in the 
fame Order as their Originals do in the Heavens ; and fo the Afpects, Eclipfes, &amp;c. of the 
Sun and Planets, would thereby be fhewn for ever. But becaule this would be inftrudtive 
only in that flow and tedious way, to fuch as could have daily recourfe to it, therefore there 
is a Handle fitted to it, by which the Axis may be fwiftly turned round •, and fo all the 
Appearances fhewn in a very little time : for by turning the Handle backwards or for- 
wards, what Eclipfes, Tranfits, &amp;c. have happened in any time paft, or what will hap- 
pen for any time to come, will be fhewn, without doing any injury to the Inftru- 
ment. 

One entire Turn of the Handle of this Inftrument, anfwers to the diurnal Motion of 
the Earth about it's Axis, and is meafured by means of an Hour-Index, placed at the Foot 
of the Wire whereon the Earth is fixed, moving once round in the fame time. Alfo ob- 
ferve that the Contrivance of this Inftrument is fuch, that the Motion may be made to tend 
either way, forwards or backwards ; and fo the Handle may be turned about 'till the Earth 
be brought to any Degree or Point of the Ecliptick required. 

Again, As the Earth moves round, by turning the Handle, the Moon's Orbit rifes and 
falls about 5 Degrees above and below the great Ecliptick, that fo her North or South La- 
titude may be exactly reprefented ; and there are two little Studs placed in two oppofue 
Points of the Moon's Orbit, reprefenting the Moon's Nod.s. 

Now if the Handle, one Turn of which anfwers to one Natural Day, or twenty-four 
Hours, be turned twenty-five times about, then the Sun will have moved once round about 
it's Axis. Again, 365 -\ of the Turns of the Handle will carry the Earth quite round the 
Sun ; 88 will carry Mercury quite round ; 244 will make Venus move once round the Sun; 
and about 27 -i Turns will carry the Moon round the Earth in her Orbit, which will like- 
wife at the fame time always turn tfje fame Hemifphere towards the Earth. 

And by thus revolving the Earth and Planets round the Sun, the Inftrument may be 
brought to exhibit Mercury, and fometimes Venus, as directly interpofed between the Earth 
and the Sun •, and then they will appear as Spots in the Sun's Difk : and this Inftrument 
fhews alfo very clearly the Difference between the Geocentrick and Heliocentrick Afpects, 
according as the Eye is placed in the Center of the Earth or Sun. 

This Inftrument likewife very plainly fhews the Difference between the Moon's Periodick 
and Synodick Months, and the reafon thereof; for if the Earth be fet to the firft Point of 
Aries, at which time fuppofe the firft New Moon happens, and afterwards the Handle be 
turned 27 \ times about, we fliall have the fecond New Moon ; and if at the Earth's Place 
in the Ecliptick where this laft New Moon happens, fome Mark be made, and then the 
Handle be turned 27 - times more, the Moon will be exactly brought again to interpofe 
between the Earth and the Sun, that is, it will be New Moon with us : but the Line of 
the Syzygy will not be right againft the aforefaid Mark in the Ecliptick, but behind it; and 
it will require two Days time, or two Turns more of the Handle, before it gets thither. 
The reafon of this is plain, becaufe in this 27 -^ Days, the Earth advances fo far forwards 
in her annual Courfe, as is the Quantity of the Difference in time between the Moon's two 
Months. 

If 



Chap. 4. °f an Aftronomical Quadrant* 1 p 1 

If the Handle be turned about 'till the Conjunction or Oppoiition of the Sun and Moon 
happens in or near the Nodes, then there will be an Eclipfe of the Sun or Moon. But in 
order yet further to fhew the Solar Eclipfes, and alfo the feveral Seafons of the Year, the 
Increafe and Decreafe of Day and Night, and the different Lengths of each in different Parts 
of our Earth, there is a little Lamp contrived to put on upon the Body of the Sun, which 
carting, by means of a Convex Glafs (the Room wherein the Inftrument is, being a little 
darkened), a ftrong Light upon the Earth, will fhew at once all thefe things: Firft, how 
one half of our Globe is always illuminated by the Sun, while the other Hemifphere is in 
the dark, and confequently how Day and Night are formed by the Revolution of the Earth 
round her Axis. Alfo by turning round the Handle, you will fee how the Shadow of the 
Moon's Body will cover fome part of the Earth, and thereby fhew, that to the Inhabitants 
of that part of the Earth there will be a Solar Eclipfe. 

When the Earth is brought to the firft Degree of Aries or Libra, the reafon of the Equa- 
lity of Days and Nights all over the Earth, will be plainly fhewn by this Inftrument ; for in 
thefe Pofitions, as the Earth turns about her Axis, juft one half of the Equator, and all 
Parallels thereto, will be in the Light, and the other half in the Dark ; and therefore the 
Days and Nights muft be every where equal : for the Horizon of the Earth's Difk will be 
parallel to the Plane of the Solftitial Colure. 

And when the Earth is brought to Cancer, the Horizon of the Difk, or that Plane which 
divides the Earth's enlightened Hemifphere from the darkened one, will not then be parallel 
to, but lie at Right Angles to the Plane of the Solftitial Colure. The Earth being now in 
Cancer, the Sun will appear to be in Capricorn, and confequently it will be our Winter Solftice. 
And as the Earth is turned either way about it's Axis, the entire Northern frigid Zone, or 
all Parts of the Earth lying within the Artick Circle, are in the dark Hemifphere; and by 
making a Mark in any given Parallel, by the Earth's diurnal Revolution, you will know how 
much longer the Nights are than the Days in that Parallel. And the contrary of this will 
happen, when the Earth is brought to Capricorn. 

Therefore this Inftrument delightfully and demonftratively fhews, how thereby all the 
Phaenomena of the different' Seafons of the Year, and the Varieties and VicifTitudes of Night 
and Day, are folved and accounted for. 

CHAP. IV. 

Of an Aflrono?nical Quadrant ', Micrometer^ and Gunter'j 

Quadrant, 

SECTION I. 

THIS Figure reprefents an Aftronomical Quadrant upon it's Pedeftal, with it's Limb Fig. 2. 
curioufly divided diagonally, and furnifhed with a fixed and moveable Telefcope. 

This Quadrant may be moved round horizontally, by turning a perpetual Screw fitted 
into the Pedeftal : For as this Screw is turned about by means of a Key, at the fame time 
it caufes the Axis A to turn, by the falling in of its Threads between the Teeth of a ftrong 
thick Circle on the faid Axis. 

Behind the Quadrant is fixed, at Right Angles to its Plane, a ftrong thick Portion of a 
Circle greater than a Semicircle, having one Semi-circle of the outfide thereof cut into 
Teeth. There is likewife another ftrong thick Portion of a Circle fomething greater than 
a Semi-circle behind the Quadrant, which is moveable upon two fixed Studs, at Right 
Angles to the former Portion ; fo that the Plane of this Portion may be parallel, inclined, 
or at Right Angles to the Plane of the Quadrant. On the fide of this Portion, which is 
made flat next to the other fixed Portion, is a contrivance with a Screw an'd perpetual 
Screw, fuch that in turning the Screw the Threads of the perpetual Screw may be locked 
in betwen the Teeth of the fixed circular Portion ; and by this means the Quadrant fixed 
to any Point, according to the direction of the Plane of the fixed Portion. And when the 
Quadrant is to be moved but a fmall matter in the aforefaid Direction, this may be done by 
turning the perpetual Screw with a Key. 

The Outfide of the abovementioned moveable circular Portion is cut into Teeth, and 
about the Center thereof the Axis A is moveable, according to the Direction of the Plane 
of the faid Portion. In this Axis Aides a little Piece carrying a perpetual Screw, whofe 
Threads, by means of a Trigger, may be locked in between the Teeth of the moveable 
circular Portion. And fo when the Axis is fet in the Pedeftal, the Quadrant may be fixed 
to any Point, according to the Direction of the Plane of the faid moveable Portion.

Therefore

Therefore by thefe Contrivances the Quadrant may be readily fixed to any required Si- 
tuation, for obferving Celeftial Phaenomeua, without moving the Pedeftal. 

There is a Piece Aiding on the Index, upon which the moveable Telefcope is fattened, 
carrying a Screw and perpetual Screw ; fo that when the Telefcope and Index are to be 
fixed upon any Point in the Limb of the Inftrument, this may be done, by means of the 
Screw which locks the Threads of the perpetual Screw in between fome of the Teeth 
cut round the curve Surface of the Limb of the Inftrument: and when the Index and Te- 
lefcope is to be moved a very minute Space backwards or forwards along the Limb, this 
is done by means of a Key turning a fmall Wheel faftened upon the aforenamed Piece, which 
is cut into a certain Number of Teeth, and whofe Axis is at Right Angles to the Plane of the 
Quadrant; for this Wheel moves another (having the fame Number of Teeth as that) which 
is at the end of the Cylinder whereon the perpetual Screw is : and by this means the perpe- 
tual Screw is turned about ; and fo the Index and Telefcope may be moved a very minute 
Space backwards or forwards along the Limb. Note, The Number of Teeth the Curve 
Surface of the Limb is divided into, muft be as great as pofiible, and the Threads of the 
perpetual Screw falling between them very fine ; for the Exactnefs of the Inftrument very 
much depends upon thus. 

Thefe Quadrants are commonly two Feet Radius, and all Brafs, except the Pedeftal and 
the perpetual Screws ; the Telefcopes have each two Glaftes and Crofs-hairs in their Foci ; 
and for the Manner of dividing their Limbs, &amp;c. See our Author's Quadrants. 

SECTION II. 

Concerning a Micrometer. 

ig, 3&lt; This Micrometer is made of Brafs : ABC^ is a rectangular Brafs Frame, the Side A B 

being about 3 Inches long, and the Side B C, as likewife the oppofite Side A g, are about 
6 Inches ; and each of thefe three Sides are -Ay of an Inch deep. The two oppofite Sides 
of this Frame are fcrewed to the circular Plate, which we mall fpeak of by and by. 

The Screw P having exactly 40 Threads in an Inch, being turned round, moves the Plate 
GDEF, along two Grooves made near the Tops of the two oppofite Sides of the Frame ; 
and the Screw QJiaving the fame Number of Threads in an Inch as P, moves the Plate 
RNMY along two Grooves made near the bottom of the faid Frame, in the fame di- 
rection as the former Plate moves, but with half the Velocity as that moves with. Thefe 
Screws are both at once turned, and fo the faid Plates moved along the fame way, by means 
of a Handle turning the perpetual Screw S, whofe Threads fall in between the Teeth of 
Pinions on the Screws P and Q^ Note, Two and a half Revolutions of the perpetual Screw 
S, moves the Screw P exactly once round. 

The Screw P turns the Hand a, faftened thereto over 100 equal Divifions made round 
the Limb of a circular Plate, to which the abovenamed two oppofite Sides of the Frame are 
fcrewed at Right Angles. The Teeth of the Pinion of the Screw P, whofe Number are 
5, takes into the Teeth of a Wheel, on the backfide of the circular Plate, whofe Number 
are 25. Again, On the Axis of this Wheel is a Pinion of two, which takes into the Teeth 
of another Wheel moving about the Center of the circular Plate, without fide the fame, 
having 50 Teeth. This lalt Wheel moves the leffer Hand b once round the abovenamed 
circular Plate, in the T .^ part of the time the Hand a is moving round : for becaufe the 
Number of Teeth of the Pinion on the Screw P, are 5, and the Number of Teeth of the 
Wheel this Pinion moves round, are 20-, therefore the Screw P moves four times round in 
the fame time the faid Wheel is moving once round. Again, Since there is a Pinion of two 
takes into the Teeth of a Wheel, whofe Number are 50, therefore this Wheel with go 
Teeth will move once round in the fame time that the Wheel of 20 Teeth hath moved 
twenty-five times round ; and confequently the Screw P, or Hand a, muft move a hundred 
times round in the fame time as the Wheel of 50 Teeth, or the Hand b&gt; hath moved once 
round. 

It follows from what hath been faid, that if the circular Plate W, which is faftened at 
Right Angles to the other circular Plate, be divided into 200 equal Parts, the Index x to 
which the Handle is faftened, will move five of thefe Parts in the fame time that the Hand a 
has moved one of the hundred Divifions round the Limb of the other circular Plate: and fo 
by means of the Index x, and Plate W, every fifth Part of each of the Divifions round the 
other Plate may be known. 

Moreover, Since each of the Screws P and Q^ have exactly 40 Threads in an Inch; 
therefore the upper Plate GDEF will move 1 Inch, when the Hand a hath moved forty 
times round, the four thoufandth part of a Inch, when the faid Hand hath moved over one 
of the Divifions round the Limb, and the twenty thoufandth part of an Inch, when the 
Index x hath moved one part of the 200 round the Limb of the circular Plate W j and the 
under Plate RNMY, half an Inch, the two thoufandth part of an Inch, and the ten 
thoufandth part of an Inch the fame way, in the faid refpective times. 

Hence, 



Chap. 4. of G miter V Quadrant. 193 

Hence, if the under Plate, having a large round Hole therein, be fixed to a Telefcope- 
fo that the Frame may be moveable together with the whole Instrument, except the faid 
lower Plate, and the ftrait fmooth Edge HI, of the fixed narrow Plate A B IH, as likewife 
the ftrait fmooth Edge D E of the moveable Plate G D E F, be perceivable thro' the round Hole 
* the under Plate, in the Focus of the Object-Glafs ; then when the Handle of the Micro- 
meter is turned, the Edge H I of the narrow Plate ABIH, fixed to the Frame, and D E 
of the moveable Plate, will appear thro' the Telefcope equally to accede to, or recede from, 
each other. And fo thefe Edges will ferve to take the apparent Diameters of the Sun, Moon, 
He. the manner of doing which is thus : Suppofe in looking at the Moon thro' the Tele- 
fcope, you have turned the Handle 'till the two Edges D E and H I are opened, fo as to 
iuft touch or clafp the Moon's Edges ; and that there was twenty-one Revolutions of the 
Hand a to compleat that Opening. Firft fay, As the focal Length of the Object-Glafs, 
which fuppofe io Feet, is to Radius, So is i Inch to the Tangent of an Angle fubtended by 
1 Inch in the Focus of the Object-Glafs, which will be found 28 Min. 30 Sec. Again, Be- 
caufe there are exa&amp;ly 4o«Threads of the Screws in one Inch, fay, If forty Revolutions of 
the Hand a give an Angle of 28 Min. 38 Sec. what Angle will twenty-one Revolutions give? 
The Anfwtr will be 15 Min. 8 Sec. and fuch was the Moon's apparent Diameter, and io may 
the apparent Diameters of any diflant Objects be taken. 

It is to be obferved, that the Divifions upon the top of the Plate G D E F, are Diagonal 
Divifions of the Revolutions of the Screws, with Diagonal Divifions of Inches againlt them ; 
and fo as the faid Plate Aides along, thefe Diagonals are cut by Divifions made on the Edge 
of the narrow Plate KL, fixed to the oppofite Sides of the Frame by means of two Screws. 
Thefe Diagonal Divifions may ferve to count the Revolutions of the Screws, and to fiiew 
how many there are in an Inch, or the Parts of an Inch. 

SECTION III. 

Of the Cortflruttion of Gunter'j Quadrant. 

This Quadrant, which is partly a Projection, that is, the Equator, Tropicks, Eclip- p . 
tick, and Horizon, are ftereographically projected upon the Plane of the Equinoctial, the Eye s 
being fuppofed to be placed in one of the Poles, may be thus made. 

About the Center A defcribe the Arc CD, which may reprefent either of the Tropicks. 
Again, Divide the Semidiameter AT fo in E, that AE being Radius, AT may be the 
Tangent of 56 Deg. 46 Min. half the Sun's greateft Declination above the Radius or Tan- 
gent of 45 Deg. To do which, fay, As the Tangent of 56 Deg. 46 Min is to 1000 ; So is 
Radius to 655: therefore if AT be made 1000 equal Parts, A E, the Radius of the 
Equator, will be 655 of thofe Parts. And if about the Center A, with the Diftance AE, 
the Quadrant E F be defcribed, this will ferve for the Equinoctial. 

Now to find the Center of the Ecliptick, which will be fomewhere in the left Side of 
the Quadrant AD (reprefenting the Meridian) you muft divide AD fo in G, that if 
A F be the Radius, AG may be the Tangent of 23. Deg. 30 Min. the Sun's greateft De- 
clination; therefore if AF be 1000, AG will be 434. And if about the Center G, with 
the Semidiameter G D, an Arc E D be defcribed, this will be I of the Ecliptick. And to 
divide it into Signs and Degrees, you muft ufe this Canon, viz. As Radius is to the Tan- 
gent of any Degree's diftance from the neareft Equinoctial Point, So is the Co-fine of the 
Sun's greateft Declination to the Tangent of that Degree's Right Afcenfion, which muft be 
counted on the Limb from the Point B, by which means the Quadrant of the Ecliptick 
may be graduated. 

As, for Example, The Right Afcenfion of the firft Point of « being 27 Deg. 54 Min. lay 
a Ruler to the Center A, and 27 Deg. 54 Min. on the Limb, from B towards C, and-whers 
it cuts the Ecliptick, will be the firft Point of a ; and fo for any other. 

The Line ET, between the Equator and the Tropick, which is called the Line of De- 
clination, may be divided into 23 Deg. 30 Min. in laying off from the Center A, the Tan- 
gent of each Degree added to 45 Deg, the Line A E being fuppofed the Radius of the 
Equinoctial. As fuppofe the Point for 10 Degrees of Declination be to be found, add 
5 Deg. (half 10.) to 45 Deg. and the Sum will be 50 Deg. the Tangent of which will be 
(fuppofing the Radius 1000) 1192 : therefore laying 1192 Parts from A, or 192 from E, 
and you will have a Point for 10 Degrees of Declination •, and fo for others. 

Moft of the principal Stars between the Equator and Tropick of Cancer^ maybe put 
on the Quadrant by means of their Declination, and Right Afcenfion. As fuppofe the 
Wing of Pegafus be 13 Deg. 7 Min. and the Right Afcenfion 358 Deg. 34 Min. from the firft 
Point of Aries. Now if about the Center A, you draw an occult Parallel thro' 13 Deg. 
7 Min. of Declination, and then lay a Ruler from the Center A thro' 1 Deg. 26 Min. (the 
Complement of 358 Deg. 34 Min. to 360 Deg.) in the Limb BC, the Point where the Ruler 
cuts the Parallel, w'rll be the Place for the Wing of Pegafus, to which you may fet the Name, 
and the Time when he comes to the South. 

D d d There 



194 ^/je ConftrucHon and Ufes Book VI. 

There being Space fufficicnt between the Equator and the Center, you may there de- 
fcribe the Qu ad rant, and divide each of the two Sides further!: from the Center into ioo 
Parts; fo (hall the Quadrant be generally prepared for any Latitude*. But before the 
particular Lines can be drawn, you mutt have tour Tables fitted tor the Latitude the Qua- 
drant is to ferve in. 

Firtt, A Table of Meridian Altitudes for the Divifion of the Circles of Days and 
Months, which may be thus made : Confider the Latitude of the Place, and the Sun's 
Declination for each Day of the Year-, if the Latitude and Declination be both North, or 
both South, add the Declination to the Complement of the Latitude; if they be one North 
and the other South, fubftract the Declination from the Complement of the Latitude, and 
you will have the Meridian Altitude for that Day. As, in the Latitude of 51 Deg. 32 Min. 
North, whofe Complement is 38 Deg. 28 Min. the Declination on the 10th of June will be 
23 Deg. 30 Min. North ; therefore add 23 Deg. 30 Min. to 38 Deg. 28 Min. and the Sum will 
be 61 Deg. 58 Min. the Meridian Altitude on the 10th ot June. Again, The Declination 
on the 10th of December will be 23 Deg. 30 Min. South ; wherefore take 23 Deg. 30 Min. 
from 1% Deg. 28 Min. and the Remainder will be 14 Deg. 58 Min. the Meridian Altitude on 
the 10th of December. And in this manner may the Meridian Altitude for each Day in the 
Year be found, and put in a Table. 

Your Table being made, you may inferibe the Months and Days of each Month on 
the Quadrant, in the Space left below the Tropick. As, Laying a Ruler upon the Center 
A, and 16 Deg. 42 Min. the Sun's Meridian Altitude on the ilt of January, in the Limb 
BC, you may draw a Line for the end of December and beginning of January. Again, Lay- 
ing a Ruler to the Center A, and 24 Deg. 34 Min. the Sun's Altitude at Noon the end of 
January, or firft of February, on the Limb, and you may draw a Line for that Day. And 
fo of others. 

Now to draw the Horizon, you mutt find its Center, which will be in the Meridian 
Line A C ; and it the Point H be taken fuch, that if A H be the Tangent Complement of 
the Latitude, viz. of 38 Deg. 28 Min. AF being fuppofed Radius; or if A F be fuppofed 
1000, and AH 776 of thoie Parts, then will H be the Center of the Horizon. Therefore 
if about the Center H, with the Diftance HE, an Arc be defcribed cutting the Tropick 
T D, the faid Arc will reprefent the Horizon. 

The next thing done, mil it be to make a Table for the Divifion of the Florizon, which 
may be done by this Canon, viz. As Radius is to the Sine of the Latitude, So is the Tan- 
gent of any Number of Degrees in the Florizon (which will be not more than 
40 in our Latitude) to the Tangent of the Arc in the Limb which will divide the 
Florizon. 

As in our Latitude, 7 Deg. ^2 Min. belongto 10 Deg. of the Degrees of the Florizon; there- 
fore laying a Ruler to the Center A, and 1 Deg. 52 Min. in the Limb B C, the Point where 
the Ruler cuts the Florizon, will be 10 Deg. in the Horizon ; and fo of the re It. But the 
Lines of DittincYion between every 5th Degree are beft drawn from the Center H. 

The third Table for drawing the Hour-Lines, mutt be a Table of the Sun's Altitude 
above the Horizon at every Hour, efpecially when he comes to the Equator, Tropicks, and 
other intermediate Declinations. If the Sun be in the F.quator, and fo have no Declination, 
as Radius to the Co- fine of the Latitude, fo is the Co-fine of any Hour from the Meridian to 
the Sine of the Sun's Altitude at that Hour. 

But if the Sun be not in the Equator, you muft fay, As the Co-fine of the Hour from the 
Meridian is to Radius, So is the Tangent of the Latitude to the Tangent of a 4th Arc. 
Then confider the Sun's Declination, and the Hour propofed ; it the Latitude and Decli- 
nation be both alike, and the Hour fall between Noon and Six, fubftract the Declination 
from the aforefaid 4th Arc, and the Remainder will be a 5th Arc. 

But if the Hour be either between Six and Midnight, or the Latitude and Declination 
unlike, add the Declination to the 4th Arc, and the Sum will be a 5th Arc. Then as the 
Sine of the fourth Arc is to the Sine of the Latitude, fo is the Co-fine of the 5th Arc to the 
Sine of the Altitude fought. 

Laftly, You may find the Sun's Declination when he rifes or fets, at any Hour, by this 
Canon, viz. As Radius is to the Sine of the Hour from Six, So is the Co-tangent of the La- 
titude to the Tangent of the Declination. 

As in our Latitude you willl find, that when the Sun rifes at five in the Summer, or 
feven in the Winter, his Declination is 11 Deg. 36 Min. whence you willfind the Sun's Me- 
ridian Altitude in the beginning of 20 will be 61 Deg. 58 Min. in n 58 Deg. 40 Min. in 
&gt;5 49 Deg. 58 Min. in °r 38 Deg. 30 Min. &amp;c. but the beginning of 25 and ur is reprefented 
by the Tropick TD, drawn thro' 23 Deg. 30 Min. of Declination, and the beginning ot 
&lt;r and ±± by the Equator E F. Now if you draw an occult Parallel between the Fquitor 
and the Tropick, at 1 1 Deg. 30 Min. of Declination, it fhall reprefent the beginning of s , "&gt;", 
ni, and X. If you draw another occult Parallel thro' 20 Deg. 12 Min. of Declination, it 
will reprefent the beginning of u, 51, f and .cr. 

Then Jay a Ruler from the Center A thro' 61 Deg. 58 Min. of Altitude in the Limb BC, 
and note the Point where it croffes the Tropick of 22. Then move the Ruler to 58 Deg. 

40 Min.

it crofles the Parallel of « ; and again to 38 Deg. 28 Min. noting where it croffes the 
Equ ;i.or •, and a Line drawn thro' thefe Points will reprefent the Line of 12 in the Summer 
while the Sun is in r, «, n, sr, si, or "R. In like manner, if you lay a Ruler to A and 
26 Deg. 58 Min. in the Limb, and note the Point where it croffes the Parallel of x ; then 
move it to 18 Deg, 16 Min. and note where it croffes the Parallel of sx. And a^a*in, to 
14 Deg, 58 Min. noting where it croffes the Tropick of vf •, the Line drawn thro' thefe Po'ints 
fh.ill (hew the 1 lour of twelve in the Winter. And in this manner may the reft of the 
Hour- Lines be drawn, only that of feven from the Meridian in Summer, and five in the 
Winter, will crofs the Line of Declination, at 11 Deg. 35 Min. and that of eight in the 
Summer, and four in the Winter, at 21 Deg. 38 Min. 

The fourth Table for drawing of the Azimuth Lines muft alfo be made for the Al- 
titude of the Sun above the Horizon, at every Azimuth, efpecially when the Sun comes to 
the Equator, Tropicks, and fome other intermediate Declinations. 

If the Sun be in the Equator, and fo has no Declination, as Radius to the Co- fine of the 
Azimuth from the Meridian ; fo is the Tangent of the Latitude to the Tangent of the Sun's 
Altitude at the Azimuth in the Equator. 

If the Sun be not in the Equator, as the Sine of the Latitude is to the Sine of the De- 
clination, io is the Co-fine of the Sun's Altitude at the Equator, at a given Azimuth, to 
the Sine of a 4th Arc. 

Now when the Latitude and Declination are both alike in all Azimuths, from the Prime 
Vertica to the Meridian, add this 4 th Arc to the Arc of Altitude at the Equator But 
when the Azimuth is above 90 Degrees diftant from the Meridian, take the Altitude at the 
Equator from this 4th Arc When the Latitude and Declination are unlike, take the faid 
4 th Arc from the Arc of Altitude at the Equator, and then you will have the Sun's Altitude 
for a propoled Azimuth. 

Laftly, When the Sun rifes or fets upon any Azimuth, to find his Declination, fay, As 
Radius to the Co-fine of the Latitude, So is the Co-fine of the Azimuth from the Meridian, 

to the Sine of the Declination. 

t N °Z % T a bh w^ S n ]' dd f accordin g t0 the ar °refaid Direftions, if you would draw the 
L.neo Eaft or Weft, which is 90 Degrees from the Meridian, lay a Ruler to the Center

where it croffes the Tropick of sb , then move the Ruler to 26 Deg. 10 Min. and note where 
t croffes the Parallel of D s then to 14 Deg. 45 Min. and note where it croffes the Parallel of « ;

USE III. The Bay of the Month being given, to find the Sun's Meridian Altitude, and 

contrariwife. 

Lay the Thread to the Day of the Month, and the Degrees which it cuts in the Limb 
will be the Sun's Meridian Altitude. 

Suppofe the Day given be May the 15th, the Thread laid upon this Day will cut 59 Dew. 
20 iVIin. the Meridian Altitude fought. 

Again, If the Thread be let to the Meridian Altitude, it will fall upon the Day of the 
Month. 

As, fuppofe the Sun's Meridian Altitude be 59 Deg. 30 Min. the Thread fet to this 
Altitude falls upon the 15th Day of May, and the 9th of July ; and which of thofe two is 
the true Day, may be known by the Quarter of the Year, or by another Day's Obferva- 
tion : for it the Sun's Altitude be greater, the Thread will fall upon the 16th of May, and 
the 8th of July ; and if it prove leffer, then the Thread will fall on the 14th of May, and 
the 10th of July \ whereby the Queftion is fully anfwered. 

USE IV. The Sun's Altitude being given, to find the Hour of the Bay, and contrariwife. 

Having put the Bead to the Sun's Place in the Ecliptick, obferve the Sun's Altitude by 
the Quadrant; and then if the Thread be laid over the fame in the Limb, the Bead will 
fall upon the Hour required. For example; Suppofe on the 10th of April, the Sun b^ing 
then in the beginning of Taurus, I obferve his Altitude by the Quadrant to be 36 Deg. 
place the Bead to the beginning of Taurus in the Ecliptick, and afterwards lay the Thread 
over 36 Degrees of the Limb ; then the Bead will fall upon the Hour-Line of 9 and 3 : and 
fo the Hour is 9 in the Morning, or 3 in the Afternoon. Again, If the Altitude be near 40 
Degrees, the Bead will fall half way between the Hour-Line of 9 and 3, and the Hour- 
Line of 10 and 2. Wherefore it mutt be either half an Hour paft 9 in the Morning, or half 
an Hour paft two in the /ifternoon; and which of thefe is the true Time of the Day, may be 
known by a fecond Obfervation : For if the Sun rifes higher, it is Morning, and if it be- 
comes lower, it is Afternoon. 

Now to find the Sun's Altitude by having the Hour given, you muft lay the Bead upon 
the Hour given (having firft rectified or put it to the Sun's Place) and then the Degrees of 
the Limb cut by the Thread, will be the Sun's Altitude fought. 

Note, The Bead may be rectified otherwife, in bringing the Thread to the Day of the 
Month, and the Bead to the Hour-Line of 12. 

U S E V. To find the Sun's Amplitude either rifing orfettihg, when the Bay of the Month or 

Sun's Place is given. 

Let the Bead rectified for the time, be brought to the Horizon ; and there it will (hew 
the Amplitude fought. If, for example, the Day given be the 4th of May, the Sun will 
then be in the 4th Degree of Gemini. Now if the Bead be rectified and brought to the Ho- 
rizon, it will there fall on 35 Deg. 8 Min. and this is the Sun's Amplitude of rifing from the 
Eaft, and of his fetting from the Weft. 

USE VI. The Bay of the Month or Sun's Place being given, to find the Afcenfwnal 

Bifference. 
Rectify the Bead for the given time, and afterwards bring it to the Horizon -, then the 
Degrees cut by the Thread in the Limb will be the afceniional Difference. And if the 
afcenfional Difference be converted into time, in allowing an Hour for 15 Degrees, and 
four Minutes of an Hour for one Degree, then we fliall have the time of the Sun's rifing 
before fix in the Summer, and after fix in the Winter : and confequently the Length of Day 
and Night may be known by this means. 

USE VII. The Sun's Altitude being given, to find his Azimuth, and contrariwife. 

Rectify the Fead for the time, and obferve the Sun's Altitude. Then bring the Thread 
to the Complement of that Altitude, and fo the Bead will give the Azimuth fought upon 
or among the Azimuth Lines. 

And to find the Altitude by having the Azimuth given, having rectified the Bead to the 
Time, move the Thread 'till the Bead falls on the given Azimuth -, then the Degrees of the 
Limb cut by the Thread, will be the Sun's Altitude at that time. 

U S E VIII. The Altitude of any one of the five Stars on the Quadrant being given, to find the 

Hour of the Night. 
Firft, Put the Bead to the Star, which you intend to obferve, and find how many Hours 
he is from the Meridian by Uje IV. then from the Right Afcenfion of the Star, fubftract 
the Sun's Right Afcenfion converted into Hours, and mark the Difference : for this Difference 
added to the obferved Hour of the Star from the Meridian, will fhew how many Hours the 
Sun is gone from the Meridian, which is in effect the Hour of the Night.

For Example ; The 15th of My, the Sun being in the' 4th Degree of Gemini, I fet the 
Bead to ArRurus, and obferving his Altitude, find him to be in the Weft, about 52 Deg. 
hiah, and the Bead to fall upon the Hour-Line of two after Noon ; then the Hour will be 
li° Hours 50 Mm. paft Noon, or 10 Minutes fhorc of Midnight. For 62 Deg. the Sun's 
right Afcenfion, converted into Time, makes 4 Hours 8 Min. which if we take out of 13 
Flours rS Mm. the right Afcenfion of Artlurus, the Difference will be 9 Hours 50 Min. 
and this being added to two Hours, the obferved Diftance of Artlurus from the Meridian, 
(hews the Hour of the Night to be 1 1 Hours 50 Min. 

Thus have I briefly fhe'wn the Manner of folving fevefal of the chief and molt ufeful 
Agronomical Problems, by means of this Quadrant. As for the Manner of taking Altitudes 
in Decrees, as likewife the Ufeof the Quadrat, fee our Author's Quadrant. 

There are other Quadrants made by Mr Sutton long fince •, one of which (being in my 
Opinion the beft) is a Stereographical Projection of 4. of thofe Circles, or quarter of the 
Sphere between the Tropicks, upon the Plane of the Equinoctial, the Eye being in the 
North Pole. 

The faid quarter on the Quadrant, is that between the South part of the Meridian, and 
Flour of Six, which will leave out all the outward Part of the Almicanters between it and 
the Tropick of Capricorn ; and inftead thereof, there is taken in fuch a like Part of the de- 
preffed Parallels to the Horizon, between the fame Hour of Six and Tropick of Capricorn, for 
the Parallels of Deprefllon have the fame Refpect to the Tropick of Capricorn, as the Paral- 
lels of Altitude have to the Tropick of Cancer, and will produce the fame Effect. 

This Projection is fitted for the Latitude of London: and thofe Lines therein that run from 
the Ricrht-hand to the Left, are Parallels of Altitude ; and thofe which crofs them, are Azi- 
muths. The lefler of the Circles that bounds the Projection, is one fourth of the Tropick 
of Capricorn, and the other one fourth of the Tropick of Cancer. There are alfo the two 
Eclipticks drawn from the fame Point in the left Edge of the Quadrant, with the Characters 
of the Signs upon them •, as likewife the two Horizons from the fame Point. The Limb is 
divided both into Degrees and Time, and by having the Sun's Altitude given, we may find 
the Hour of the Day to a Minute by this Quadrant. 

The Ouadranta! Arcs next the Center contain the Calendar of Months •, and under them 
in another Arc is the Sun's Declination : fo that a Thread laid from the Center over any Day 
of the Month, will fall upon the Sun's Declination that Day in this laft Arc, and on the 
Limb upon the Sun's right Afcenfion for that fame Day. There are feveral of the rnoffe 
noted fixed Stars between the Tropics, placed up and down in the Projection •, and next 
below the Projection is the Quadrat and Line of Shadows, being only a Line of natural 
Tangents to the Arcs of the Limb j and by help thereof, the Heights of Towers, SteepleSi 
fcff. may be pretty exactly taken. 

Now the Manner of ufing this Projection in finding the Time of the Sun's rifing or 
fetting, his Amplitude, Azimuth, the Hour of the Day, &amp;c. is thus : Having laid the 
Thread to the Day of the Month, bring the Bead * to the proper Ecliptick (which is called 
rectifying it), and afterwards move the Thread, and bring the Bead to the Horizon : then 
the Thread will cut the Limb in the Time of the Sun's rifing or fetting, before or after Six* 
And at the fame Time the Bead will cut the Horizon in the Degrees of the Sun's Ampli- 
tude. Again, Suppofe the Sun's Altitude on the 24th of April be obferved 45 Degrees, 
What will the Hour and Azimuth then be? Having laid the Thread over the 24th of April, 
bring the Bead to the Summer Ecliptick, and then carry it to the Parallel of the Altitude 
45 Degrees : and then the Thread will cut the Limb at 55 Deg. 15 Min. and fo the Hour 
will be either 41 Min. paft Nine in the Morning, or 19 Min. paft Two in the Afternoon. 
And the Bead among the Azimuths fhews the Sun's Diftance from the South to be 50 Deg. 
41 Min. 

Note, If the Sun's Altitude be lefs than that which it hath at fix o'Clock, on any given 
Day ; then the Operation muft be performed among thofe Parallels above the upper Horizon, 
the Bead being rectified to the Winter Ecliptick. 

There are a great many other Ufes of this Quadrant, which I fhall omit, and refer you 
to Collins's Sector upon a Quadrant, wherein it's Defcription and Ufe, together with thofe 
of two other Quadrants, are fully treated of. 

The Bead is a little round Leaden or Btafs Shot, with a /mall Hole thro" 1 it, that moves ftiffly up and doivrtt 
fo as to remain at any Point or Part of the Thread of a Plummet fajlened to the Centre of the Quadrant.

SECTION I. 

HE firft Figure fhews the Compafs Card, whofe Limb reprefents the Horizon 
of the World. It is divided into four times 90 Degrees, and very often but 
into 32 equal Parts; for the 32 Points, whereof the four principal Points, 
which are called Cardinal ones, crofs each other at Risht Angles, viz. the 
North, diftinguifhed by the Flower- de -Luce, the South oppofite thereto, and 
the Eaft and Weft. Now if each of thefe Quarters be bifected, we fhall 
have the eight Rhumbs. Again, Bifecting each of thefe laft Spaces, we mall have the eight 
Semi-Rhumbs. And laftly, Bifecting each of thefe laft Parts, we fhall have the fixteen 
Quarter-Rhumbs. The four Collateral Rhumbs take their Name from the four Piincipal 
Rhumbs, each afluming the two Names of thofe that are nigheft them : as, the Rhumb 
in the Middle, between the North and the Eaft, is called North-Eaft ; that between the 
South and the Eaft, is called South-Eaft ; that between the South and the Weft, is called' 
South- Weft ; and that in the Middle between the North and the Weft, is called North- 
Weft. 

Alfo every of the eight Semi-Rhumbs afiumes it's Name from the two Rhumbs that be 
nigheft it ; as that between the North and North-Eaft, is called North North-Eaft ; that be- 
tween the Eaft and North-Eaft, is called Eaft North-Eaft ; that between the Eaft and South- 
Eaft, is called Eaft South-Eaft •, and fo of others. 

Finally, Each of the Quarter-Rhumbs has it's Name compofed of the Rhumbs or Semi- 
Rhumbs which are nigheft to it, in adding the Word one-fourth after the Name of the 
Rhumb neareft to it. For Example; The Quarter-Rhumb neareft to the North, and next 
to the North-Eaft, is called North one-fourth North-Eaft ; that which is neareft the North- 
Eaft towards the North, is called North-Eaft, one-fourth North ; and fo of others, as they 
appear abbreviated round the Card. Each Quarter-Rhumb contains 11 Deg. 15 Min. the 
Semi-Rhumbs 22 Deg. 30 Min. and the whole Rhumbs 45 Deg. 

The Infide of this Card, which is fuppofed double, is likewife divided into 32 equal 
Parts, by a like Number of Radii, denoting the 32 Points, and the Middle thereof, which 
is glewed upon a Pafteboard, hath a free Motion upon it's Pivot, that fo it may be ufed when 
the Declination or Variation of the Needle is found. Note, The Outfide of this Card is placed 

upon the Limb of the Box.

Chap. i. of the Sea-Compafs. 199 

The fecond Figure reprefents a piece of Steel in form of a Rhumbus, which ferves for the 
Needle, and is fattened under the moveable Card with two little Pins, fo that one of the ends 
of the 'longeft Diameter of the faid Rhumbs be precifely under the Flower-de-luce. This 
piece of Steel muft be touched by a good Load-ftone ; fo that one end may direct itfelf to- 
wards the North part of the World. The manner of doing which, we have already ftiewn 
in fpeaking of the Load-ftone, and the Compafs. Note, It is not fo well to glew the faid 
Needle under the Card, as fome do, as otherwife to faften it ; becaufe that caufes a Ruft very 
contrary to the magnetick Virtue. 

The little Figure B, in the middle of the Rhumbus, which is called the Cap of the Needle* 
is made of Brais, and hollowed into a Conical Form. This Cap is applied to the Center of 
the Card, and is fattened thereto with Glew. 

The third Figure reprefents the whole Compafs, whereof A is a round wooden Box, 
about fix or feven Inches Diameter, and four deep ; (we fometimes make thefe Boxes fquare) 
hb and cc are two Brafs Hoops, the greater of which being b b, is fattened to the Sides of 
the Box at the oppofite Places B B. The other Hoop c C is fattened by two other Pivots, at 
the Places CC, diametrically oppofite to the Hoop bb ; and thefe two Pivots go into Holes 
made towards the top of another kind of wooden Box, in which the Card is put. And by 
this means, this laft Box, and the two Hoops will, have a very free Motion •, fo that when 
the &lt;*reat Box A is placed flat in a Ship, the letter Box will be always horizontal, and in equili- 
bria, notwithttanding the Motion of the Ship. In the middle of the Bottom of this laft Box, 
is placed a very ftrait and well pointed brafs Pivot, on which is placed the Cap B of the Card, 
which Card having a very free Motion, the Flower-de-luce will turn towards the North, and 
all the other Points towards the other correfpondent Parts of the World. Finally, the Card 
is covered with a Glafs, that fo the Wind may have no power on it. 

Ufe of the* Sea-Con, pafs. 

The Courfe that a Ship muft take to fail to a propofed Place, being known by a Sea- 
Chart, and the Compafs placed in the Pilot's Room, fo as the two parallel Sides of the 
fquare Box to be fixed according to the length of the Ship, that is, parallel to a Line drawn 
from the Poop to the Prow ; make aCrofs, or other Mark, upon the middle of that Sid'- of 
the fquare Box perpendicular to the Ship's length, and the moft diftant from the Po^p, 
that fo the Stern of the Ship by this means may be directed accordingly. 

Example. Departing from the Ifland of Ufhant, upon the Confines of Britany, we defire to 
fail towards Cape Finijlerre in Galicia. Now in order to do this, we muft firft fcek (according 
to the manner hereafter directed) in a Mercator's Chart, the Direction or Courfe of the Ship 
leading to that Place ; and this we find is between the South- Weft and the South South-Weft; 5 
that is, the Ship's Courfe muft be South- Weft, one-fourth to the South. Therefore having a fair 
Wind, turn the Stern of the Ship, fo that a Line tending from the South- '- /eft, one-fourth 
South, exactly anfwers to the Crofs marked upon the middle of the Side of the fquare Box ; 
and then we mall have our Defire. And by this means, which is really admirable, we may 
direct a Ship's Courfe as well in the Night as in the Day, as well being fhut up in a Room 
in the Ship, as in the open Air, and as well in cloudy Weather as fair ; fo that we may al- 
ways know whether the Ship goes out of her proper Direction. 

Of the Variation or Declination of the Needle. 
It is found by experience, that the touched Needle varies from the true North, that is, 
the Flower-de-luce does not exactly tend to the North part of the World, but varies there- 
from, fometimes towards the Eaft, fometimes towards the Weft, more or lefs, according to 
different Times, and at different Places. 

About the Year 1 665, the Needle at Paris did not decline or vary at all •, whereas now its 
Variation is there above 12 Degrees North- weftwardly, Therefore every time a favourable 
Opportunity offers, you muft endeavour to obferve carefully the Variation of the Needle, 
that fo refpect thereto may be had in the fteering of Ships. If, for example, the Variation 
of the Needle in the Ifland of UJhant, which was the fuppofed Place of Departure in the 
abovementioned Example, was 10 Degrees; and if the Ship fhould exactly keep the Courfe 
of South- Weft, one- fourth to the South, inftead of arriving at the Cape Finijlerre, it would 
to another Country 10 Degrees more to the Eaft. 

Now to remedy this, you need only remove the Crofs, upon the Side of the Box, fhewing 
the Rhumb of Direction, more eafterly by the Quantity of the D6grees of the Needle's Va- 
riation weftwardly ; and fo as often as a new Declination or Variation of the Needle be 
found, the place of the faid Crofs muft be altered. Note, When the Box is quite round, a 
Mark muft be made againft the North and South on the Body of the faid Box. 

If like wife a VelTel departs from the Sorlings in England, in order to fail to the Ifland of 
Madeira, you will find by a Sea-Chart that her Courfe muft be South South- Weft ; but if at 
the fame time the Variation of the Needle be fix Degrees North Eafterly, the the Crofs denoted 
upon the Edge of the Compafs muft be removed fix Degrees towards the Weft, in order to 
direct the Ship according to her true Courfe found in the Chart, 

* But 



200 The ConflruBion and Ufes Book VII. 

But if a Sea-Compafs be ufed, wherein the Pofition of the Needle may be altered, as that 
which hath a double Card, the Flower-de-luce of the Card mud be fixed, lb that its Point may 
fhew the true North ; and then you will have it to alter every time there is a new Varia- 
tion obferved. Now in this Cafe the Crofs upon the Edge of the Compafs muft not be 
altered. 

It is very necefiary, and principally in long Courfes, for Seamen to make Celeftial Ob- 
fervations often, in order to have the Variation of the Needle exactly, that the Direction 
of the VefTel may thereby be truly had, as likewife that they may know where they are, 
after having efcaped a great Storm, during which they were obliged to leave the true Courfe, 
and let the Veffel run according as the Wind or Currents drove her. 

SECTION II. 

Of the Azimuth Compafs. 

Fig. 4. This Compafs is fomething different from the common Sea-Compafs before fpoken of. 

For upon the round Box, wherein is the Card, is faftened a broad brafs Circle A B, one 
Semi-circle whereof is divided into 90 equal Parts or Degrees, numbered from the middle 
of the faid Divifions both ways, with 10, 20, &amp;c. to 45 Degrees; which Degrees are alfo 
divided into Minutes by Diagonal Lines and Circles : But thefe graduating Lines are drawn 
from the oppofite part of the Circle, viz. from the Point b, wherein the Index turns in 
time of Obfervation. 

b c is that Index moveable about the Point b, having a Sight ba erected thereon, which 
moves with a Hinge, that fo it may be raifed or laid down, according to necefiity. From 
the upper part of this Sight, down to the middle of the Index, is faftened a fine Hypothe- 
nufal Lute- firing, or Thread d e&gt; to give a Shadow upon a Line that is in the middle of the 
faid Index. 

Note, The reafon of making the Index move on a Pin faftened in b, is, that the Degrees 
and Divifions may be larger; for now they are as large again as they would have been, if 
they had been divided from the Center, and the Index made to move thereon. 

The abovenamed broad brafs Circle A B, is crofted at Right Angles with two Threads, 
and from the ends of thefe Threads are drawn four fmall black Lines on the In fide of the 
round Box ; alfo there are four Right Lines drawn at Right Angles to each other on the 
Card. 

This round Box, thus fitted with its Card, graduated Circle, and Index, &amp;c. is to be 
hung in the brafs Hoops BB-, and thefe Hoops are faftened to the great fquare wooden 
Box C C. 

The life of the Azimuth Compafs in finding the Sun's Magnetic al Azimuth or Amplitude, and 

from thence the Variation of the Compafs. 

There are feveral ways of finding the Variation of the Needle, as by the rifing and fet- 
ting of the fame Star, or by the Obfervation of two equal Altitudes of the Star above the 
Horizon, fince the faid Star, at each of thofe Times, will be equally diftant from the true 
Meridian of the World ; or elfe by a Star's paffage over the Meridian. 

Buc thefe Methods are not much ufed at Sea: Firft, becaufe the Time wherein the Sun, 
or a Star, paffes over the Meridian, cannot be known precifely enough ; for there is a great 
deal of Time taken in making Obfervations of the Sun's Altitudes, 'till he is found to 
have the greateft, that is, his Meridian Altitude. 

Secondly, Becaufe the Sun's Declination may be considerably altered, and alfo the Ship's 
Latitude between the Times of the two Obfervations of his equal Altitudes above the Ho- 
rizon, Morning and Evening, or of his Rifing and Setting. 

Therefore the Variation of the Compafs may much better be found by one Obfervation 
of the Sun's magnetical Amplitude, or Azimuth. But the Sun's Declination, and the La- 
titude of the Place the Ship is in, muft be known, that fo his true Amplitude may be had ; his 
Altitude muft alfo be given, when the magnetick Azimuth is taken, that fo his true Azimuth 
may be had at that Time alfo. 

Now if the Obfervation be for an Amplitude at Sun-rifing, or an Azimuth before Noon, 
you muft put the Center of the Index be upon the Weft Point of the Card within the Box, 
fo that the four Lines on the Edge of the Card, and the four Lines on the Infide of the Box, 
may agree or come together. But if the Obfervation be for the Sun's Amplitude, Setting, 
or an Azimuth in the Afternoon, then you muft turn the Center of the Index right-againft 
the Eaft Point of the Card, and make the Lines within the Box concur with thefe on the 
Card. Having thus fitted the Inftrument for Obfervation, turn the Index be towards the 
Sun, 'till the Shadow of the Thread de falls directly upon the Hit of the Sight, and upon 
the Line that is along the middle of the Index ; then will the inner Edge of the Index cut 
the Degree and Minute of the Sun's magnetical Azimuth, from the North or South. 

But note, that if the Compafs being thus placed, the Azimuth be lefs than 45 Deg. from 
the South, and the Index be turned towards the Sun, it will then pafs off the Divifions of 

the 



Chap. r. of the Azimuth Compafs. 2,01 

the Limb, and fo they become ufelefs as it now Hands : therefore you muft turn the Inftru- 
ment juft a Quarter of the Compafs, that is, place the Center of the Index on the North or 
South Point ot the Card, according as the Sun is from you, and then the Edge thereof will 
cut the Degree of the Magnetick Azimuth, or Sun's Azimuth from the North, as 

before. 

The Sun's Magnetical Amplitude (that is, the Diftance from the Eaft or Weft Points of 
the Compafs, to that Point in the Horizon whereat the Sun rifes or fets), being obferved by 
this Inftrument, the Variation of the Compafs may be thus found. 

Example. Being out at Sea the 15th Day of May, in the Year 1715, in 45 Degrees of 
North Latitude, I find from Tables that the Sun's Declination is 19 Deg. North, and his 
Eaft Amplitude 27 Deg. 25 Min. North. Now I oblerve by the Azimuth Compafs, the 
Sun's Magnetical Amplitude at his rifing and fetting, and find that he rifes between the 6id 
and 63d Deg. reckoning from the North towards the Eaft part of the Compafs, that is, be- 
tween the 27th and 28th Degrees from the Eaft ; and fince in this Cafe the magnetical Am- 
plitude is equal to the true Amplitude, I conclude that at this Place and Time, the Needle 
has no Variation. 

But if the Sun at his rifing mould have appeared between the 52d and 53d Degrees from 
the North towards the Eaft, his magnetical Amplitude would then be between %j and 38 
Degrees, that is, about 10 Dgrees greater than the true Amplitude: and therefore the 
Needle would vary about 10 Degrees Nortn- - afterly. If, on the contrary, the magnetical 
Eaft Amplitude found by the Inftrument fhould be lefs than the true Amplitude, their Dif- 
ference would mew that the Variation of the Needle is North-Eafterly. For if the magne- 
tical Amplitude be greater than the true Amplitude, this proceeds from hence, that the Eaft 
part of the Compafs is drawn back from the Sun towards the South, and the Flower-de-luce 
of the Card approaches to the Eaft, and fo gives the Variation North-Eafterly. The rcafon 
for the contrary of this is equally evident. 

If the true Eaft Amplitude be Southwardly, as likewife the magnetical Amplitude, and 
this la ft be the greater ; then the Variation of the Needle will be Ivorth Weft ; and if, on 
the contrary, the magnetical Amplitude.be lefs than the true Amplitude, the Variation of 
the Needle will be North-Eafterly, as many Degrees as ate contained in their Difference. 

What we have faid concerning North- Eaft Amplitudes, muft be undcrftood of South- Weft 
Amplitudes, and what we have faid of South- Eaft Amplitudes, muft be undcrftood of North- 
Weft Amplitudes. 

finally, If Amplitudes are found of different Denominations ; for Example, when Am- 
plitudes are Eaft, if the true Amplitude be 6 Deg. North, and the magnetical Amplitude 
5 Deg. South •, then the Variation, which in this Cafe is North- Weft, will be greater than 
the true Amplitude, it being equal to the Sum of the magnetical and true Amplitudes : and 
fo adding them together, we mail have 1 1 Degrees of North- Weft Variation. Underftand 
the fame for Weft Amplitudes. 

The Variation of the Compafs may likewife be found by the Azimuth ; but then the Sun's 
Declination, the Latitude of the Place, and his Altitude muft be had, that fo his true Azi- 
muth may be found. 






CHAP. II. 

Of the ConftruSiion and Ufe of Inftrument s for taking the Alti- 
tudes of the Sun or Stars at Sea. 

Of the Sea- Aftrolabe. 

THE moft common Inftrument for taking of Altitudes at Sea is the Aftrolabe, which Fig&gt;5 ; 
confifts of a brafs Circle, about one Foot in Diameter, and fix or feven Lines in Thick- 
nefs, that fo it may be pretty weighty : there is fometimes likewife a Weight of fix or feven 
Pounds hung to this Inftrument at the Place B, that fo when the. Aftrolabe is fufpended by 
it's Ring A, which ought to be very moveable, the faid Inftrument may turn any way, and 
keep a perpendicular Situation during the Motion of the Ship. 

The Limb of this Inftrument is divided into four times 90 Degrees, and very often into 
halves, and fourths of Degrees. 

It is ahfolutely neceffary, that the Right Line C D, which reprefents the Horizon, be 
perfectly level, that fo the beginning of the Divifions of the Limb of the Inftrument may 
be made therefrom. Now to examine whether this be fo or no, you muft obferve lome 
diftant Object thro' the Slits or little Holes of the Sights F and G, fattened near the Ends 
of the Index, freely turning about the Center E, by means of a turned-headed Rivet : I 

F f f % 



ioi The ConftruEtion and Ufes Book VII. 

fay, you muft obferve the faid diftant Objects, in placing the Eye to one of the faid Sights 
for Exurrtple, toG: then if the Aftrolabe be turned about, and the fame Object apoears 
thro' the other Sight F, without moving the Index, it is a fign the Fiducial Line of the Index 
is horizontal. But if at the fecond time of Obfervation, the Index muft be raifed or lowered 
before the Object be efpied thro' the Sights, then the middle Point between the two Pofitions 
will fhew the true horizontal Line pafTing thro' the Center of the Inftrument, which muft 
be verified by feveral repeated Obfervations, before the Divifions of the Limb are begun to 
be made, in the Manner as we have elfewhere explained. 

Ufe of the Aftrolabe. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument is for obferving the Sun or Stars Altitude above the Hori- 
zon, or their Zenith Diftance. The Manner of effecting which, is thus : Holding the 
Aftrolabe fufpended by it's Ring, and turning it's Side towards the Sun, move the Index 
'till the Sun's Rays pals thro' the Sights F and G ; then the Extremes of the Index will give 
the Altitude of the Sun in H, upon the divided Limb, from C to F, comprehended between 
the horizontal Radius EC and the Rays EF of the Sun, becaufe the Inftrument in this 
Situation reprefents a Vertical Circle. Now the Divifions of the Arcs BGor AF, fhew the 
Sun's Zenith Diftance. 

The Conjlrufiion of the Ring. 

Fig. 6. This Figure reprefents a brafs Ring or Circle, about 9 Inches in Diameter, which it is ne- 

cefiary fhould be pretty thick ; that fo being weighty, it may keep it's perpendicular Situ- 
ation better than when it is not fo heavy, having the Divifions denoted on the Concave Sur- 
face thereof. The little Hole C, made thro' the Ring, is 45 Degrees diftant from the Point 
of Sufpenfion B, and is the Center of the Quadrant DE, divided into 90 Degrees, one of 
whofe Radius's C E, is parallel to the Vertical Diameter B H of the Ring, and the other 
horizontal Radius C D, is perpendicular to the faid Vertical Diameter. 

Now having found the faid horizontal Radius C D very exactly, by fufpending the Ring, 
&amp;V. Radius's muft be drawn from the Center C, to each Degree of the Quadrant D E, and 
upon the Points wherein the faid Radius's cut the Concave Surface of the Ring, the corre- 
fpondent Numbers of the Degrees of the Quadrant muft be graved •, and fo the Concave 
Surface of the Ring, will be divided from F to G. This Divifioning may be firft made 
feparately upon a Plane, and afterwards transferred upon the Concave Surface of the 
Ring. 

This Inftrument is reckoned better than the Aftrolabe, becaufe the Divifions of the 
Degrees upon the Concave Surface are larger in proportion to it's bignefs, than thofe on the 
Aftrolabe. 

The Ufe of the Ring. 

When this Inftrument is to be ufed, you muft fufpend it by the Swivel B, and turn it to- 
wards the Sun A ; fo that it's Rays may pafs thro' the Hole C. This being done, the little 
Spot will fall between the horizontal Line C F, and vertical Line CG, upon the Degrees of 
the Sun's Altitude on the Infide of the Ring, reckoned from F to I. 

Of the Quadrant. 

Fig. 7. The Inftrument of Figure 7, is a Quadrant about one Foot Radius, having it's Limb di- 

vided into 90 Degrees, and very often each Degree into every 5th Minute by Diagonals. 
There are two Sights fixed upon one of the Sides A E, and the Thread to which the Plum- 
met is faftened, is fixed in the Center A. I fhall not here mention the Conftruction of this 
Inftrument, becaufe we have fufficiently fpoken thereof in Chap. V. Book IV. 

Now to ufe this Inftrument, you muft turn it towards the Sun D, in fuch manner that 
it's Rays may pafs thro' the Sights A and E, and then the Thread will fall upon the Degrees 
of the Sun's Altitude on the Limb, in the Point C, reckoned from B to C, and the Com- 
plement of his Altitude reckoned from E to C. 

Of the Fore-Staff, or Crofs-Staff. 

Fig. 8. This Inftrument confifts of a ftrait fquare graduated Staff A B, between two and three 

Foot in length, and four Crofles or Vanes FF, E E, D D, C C, which flide ftiffly thereon. 
The firft and fhorteft of thefe Vanes FF, is called the Ten-crofs or Vane, and belongs to 
that Side of the Staff whereon the Divifions begin at about 3 Degrees from the End A, 
(whereat the Eye is placed in time of Obfervation) to 10 Degrees. Note, Sometimes the 
Thirty-crofs E F is fo made, as that the Breadth thereof ferves inftead of this Ten-crofs. 

The next longer Vane E E, is called the Thirty-crofs, and belongs to that Side of the 
Staff, whereon the Divifions begin at 10 Degrees, and end at 30 Degrees, and this is called 
the Thirty-fide : Half the Length of the Thirty-vane will reach on this Thirty-fide, from 
30 Deg. to 23 Deg. 52 Min. and the whole Length from 30 Deg. to 19 Deg. 47 Min.

The next longer Vane DD, is called the Sixty-crofs, and belongs to that Side of the Staff 
whereon the Divifions begin at 20 Deg. and end at 6oDeg. and is called the Sixty-fide. The 
length of this Crofs will reach on this Sixty-fide, from 60 Deg. to 3a Deg. 

The longeft Crofs CC, is called the Ninety-crofs, and belongs to that Side whereon the 
Divifions begin at 30 Degrees, and end at 90 Degrees, and is called the Ninety-fide of the 
Staff: the Degrees on the feverai Sides of the Staff, are numbered with their Complements 
to go Degrees in final 1 Figures. 

This Staff may be graduated Geometrically thus : Upon a Table, or on a large Paper Fig. 9. 
parted fmoothly upon fome Plane, draw the Line FG, the length of the Staff to be gradua- 
ted, and on F and G raife the Perpendiculars FC and GD; upon which lay off the 
Length you intend for the half Length of one of the four Croffes, from F to C, and G to 
D, and draw the Line C D reprefenting the Staff to be graduated. This being done, about 
the Center F, with the Semidiarneter FG or C D, defenbe an eighth part of a Circle, 
which divide into 90 equal Parts. Then if Right Lines be drawn from the Point F, to 
each of the aforefaid Divifions, thefe Lines will divide the Line CD, as the Staff ought to 
be graduated. 

But if this Staff is to be graduated by the Table of natural Tangents, you muff firfl 
obferve, that the Graduations are only the natural Co-tangents of half Arcs, the half Crofs 
being Radius ; therefore divide the length of the half Crofs into 1000 equal Parts, or 1 00000 
if poffible, according to the Radius of the Tables of natural Tangents : then take from 
this the Co-tangents, as you find them in the Table, and prick them from F fucceffively, and 
your Staff will be graduated for that Vane. So do for the reft feverally. If it be requi- 
red to prick down the 80th Degree, the half of 80 is 40, and the natural Co-tangent of 
40 Deg. is 1 191 75, which take from the Scale or half Crofs fo divided, and prick it from 
F to P, and that will be the Point for 80 Degrees, &amp;V. So again, To put on the 64th De- 
gree, half of 64 is 32, and its Co-tangent is 160033, which take from the divided Croft 
(prolonged), prick it from E, and you will have the 64th Degree. 

Now that the Crofs CD, when transferred to B, lhall make the Angles C A D eighty Fj - e lQ 
Degrees, is demonftrable thus: Since CB the half Crofs is Radius, and A B is by Con- 
ftru&amp;ion the Tangent of 50 Deg. the Angle ACB is 50 Degrees ; and fince the Triangle 
ABC is Right Angled, the Angle BAC will be 40 Degrees: but the Angle DACis 
double the Angle B A C •, therefore the Angle DAC is 80 Degrees, and the Point B the 
true Point on the Staff for 80 Degrees. The fame Demonftration holds, let the Crofs be 
what it will. 

If the Staff be to be graduated by any Diagonal Scale, meafure half the Length of the 
Vane by the Scale, and fay, As the Radius of the Tables 1 00000, is to the Meafure of half 
the Crofs, So is the natural Co-tangent of the half any Number of Degrees defired to 
be pricked on the Staff, to the Space between the Center of the Staff F, and the Point for 
the Degrees fought. 

For Example •, Suppofe half the Length of the Vane, meafured on a Diagonal Scale, be 
945 •, to find what Number muft be taken off the Diagonal Scale for the 80th Degree. 
The Co tangent of 40 Degrees (half of 80) is 1191753, which being multiplied by 945, 
and divided by Radius, gives 11 261. And this being taken from the Diagonal Scale, w.ill 
give the Degrees defired. 

The Ufe of the Fore-Staff. 
The chief Ufe of this Inftrument, is to take the Altitude of the Sun or Stars, or the 
Diftance of two Stars ; and the Ten, Thirty, Sixty and Ninety Croffes are to be ufed, 
according as the Altitude is greater or leffer j that is, if it be lefs than 10 Degrees, the 
Ten Crofs muft be ufed •, if above 10, but lefs than 30 Degrees, the Thirty Crofs muft be 
ufed •, and if the Altitude be judged to be above 30, but lefs than 60 Degrees, the Sixty Crofs 
muft be ufed. But when Altitudes are greater than 60 Degrees, this Inftrument is not fo 
convenient as others. 

To obferve an Altitude. 
Place the flat End of the Staff to the outfide of your Eye, as near the Eye as you can, Fig , N 
and look at the upper End b of the Crofs for the Center of the Sun or Star, and at the 
lower End a for the Horizon. But if you fee the Sky inflead of the Horizon, flide the 
Crofs a little nearer to your Eye ; and if you fee the Sea inflead of the Horizon, move the 
Crofs a little further from your Eye, and fo continue moving the Crofs till you fee exactly 
the Sun or Star's Center by the top of the Crofs b[ and the Horizon by the bottom thereof 
a. Then the Degrees and Minutes cut by the inner Edge c of the Crofs, upon the Side of 
the Staff peculiar to the Crofs you ufe, is the Altitude of the Sun or Star : But if it be 
the Meridian Altitude you are to find, you muft continue your Obfervation as long as you 
find the Altitude increafe, ftill moving the Crofs nearer to your Eye j but when you per- 
ceive the Altitude is diminifhed, forbear any farther Obfervation, and do not alter your 
Crofs •, but as it (lands, count the Degrees and Minutes on the Side proper to the Crofs, 
and you will have the Meridian Altitude required, as alfo the Zenith Diftance, by fub- 

ftracting

the obferved 



drafting the faid Altitude from 90 Degrees, if it be not graduated on the Staff. To which 
Zenith Diftance add the Minutes allowed for the Height of your Eye above the Surface of 
the Sea, according to the little Table in the Margin, or fubftracl it from the Altitude, and 
then you will have the true Zenith Diftance and Altitude. 

If it be hazy or fomewhat thick Weather, the Fore-Staff may be 
ufed as above-, but if the Sun fhines out, the upper Limb of the 
Sun muft be either obferved, and afterwards his Semidiameter mult 
be fubftra&amp;ed from the Altitude found, or elfe a coloured Glafs on 
the top of the Crofs muft be ufed, to defend the Sight from the 
Splendor of the Sun. 

To obferve the Diftance or two Stars, or the Moon's Diftance from 
a Star, place the Staff's flat end to the Eye, as before directed, and 
looking to both ends a and b of the Crofs, move it nearer or farther 
from the Eye, 'till you can fee the two Stars, the one on one end, 
and the other on the other end of the Crofs. Then fee what De- 
grees and Minutes are cut by the Crofs on the fide 
proper to that Vane in life j and thofe Degrees fliew 
Star's Diftance. 

But that there may be no Miftake in placing the Staff to the Eye, 
which is the greateft Difficulty in the Ufe of this Inftrument : 
Firft, before Obfervation, put on the Sixty-crofs, and place it to 
30 Degrees on its proper Side, and alfo the Ninety-crofs, Aiding to 
it 30 Degrees likewife on his Right Side : this being done, place 
the end of the Staff to the corner of your Eye, moving it fomething 
higher or lower about the Eye, 'till you fee the upper ends of the 
two Croffes at once exactly in a Right Line, and alfo their lower 
ends ; and that is the true Place of your Staff in Time of Obfer- 
vation. 

If the Sun's Altitude is to be obferved backwards by this In- 
ftrument, you muft have an horizontal Vane to fix upon the 
Center or Eye-end of the Crofs, as alfo a Shoe of Brafs for a Sight 
Vane, to fit on to the end of any of the Croffes ; then when you 
would obferve, having put on the horizontal Vane, and fixed the 
Shoe to the end of a convenient Crofs, turn your back to the Sun, 
and looking through the Sight in the brafs Shoe, lift the end of the 
Staff up or down, 'till the Shadow made by the upper end of the Crofs falls upon the flit in 
the Horizon-Vane, and at the fame time you can fee the Horizon through the Horizon- 
Vane. Then the Degrees and Minutes cut by the Crofs on the proper Side, are the Alti- 
tude. But if there be fixed a Lens, or fmall double Convex-Glafs, to the upper end of the 
Vane, to contract the Sun-beams, and caft a fmall bright Spot on the Horizon-Vane, this 
will be found more convenient than the Shadow, which is commonly imperfect and 
double. 

Of the Englijh Quadrant, or Back-Staff. 

This Inftrument is commonly made of Pear-Tree, and confifts of three Vanes A, B, C, 
and two Arcs. The Vane at A is called the Horizon-Vane, that at B the Shade- Vane, 
becaufe it gives the Shadow upon the Horizon- Vane in Time of Obfervation, and that at 
C the Sight- Vane, becaufe in Time of Obfervation it is placed at the Eye. The lelfer 
Arc DE is the Sixty Arc, and that marked F G is the Thirty Arc, both of which toge- 
ther make 90 Degrees, but they are of different Radius's. The Sixty Arc D E is divided 
into 60 Degrees, commonly by every five, but fometimes by fingle Degrees. In Time of 
Obfervation, the Shadow- Vane is placed upon this Arc always to an even Degree. 

The Thirty Arc GF, is divided into 30 Degrees, and each Degree into Minutes by Dia- 
gonal Lines, and Concentrick Arcs. The Manner of doing which, I have already laid down 
elfewhere. 

The Ufe of the EngliJJj Quadrant. 
If the Sun's Altitude be to be taken by this Inftrument, you muft put the Horizon- 
Vane upon the upper End or Center A of the Quadrant, the Shade- Vane upon the Sixty 
Arc D E, to fome Number of Degrees lefs than you judge the Co-altitudes will be by 10 
or 15 Degrees, and the Sight- Vane upon the Thirty Arc F G. This being done, lift up the 
Quadrant, with your Back towards the Sun, and look through the fmall Hole in the Sight- 
Vane C-, and fo raife or lower the Quadrant 'till the Shadow of the upper Edge of the 
Shade- Vane B falls upon the upper Edge of the flit in the Horizon-Vane A : if then at the 
fame time the Horizon appears thro' the faid flit, the Obfervation is finifhed ; but if the Sea 
appears inftead of the Horizon, then remove the Sight Vane lower towards F; but if the 
Sky appears inftead of the Horizon, then Aide the Sight- Vane a little higher: and fo con- 
tinue removing the Sight- Vane, 'till the Horizon appears thro' the Ait of the Horizon- 
Vane, 



Chap. 2. of biftruments for taking Altitudes, &amp;c. 2,05 

Vane, and the Shadow of the Shade- Vane falls at the fame time on the faid Slit of the Ho- 
rizon-Vane. This being done, fee how many Degrees and Minutes are cut by the Edge of 
the Sight- Vane C, which anfwers to the Sight-Hole, and to them add the Degrees that are 
cut by the upper Edge of the Shade- Vane, and the Sum is the Zenith Diftance or Comple- 
ment of the Altitude. But to find the Sun's Meridian or greateft Altitude on any Day, 
you muft continue the Obfervation as long as the Altitude be found to increafe, which you 
will perceive, by having the Sea appear inftead of the Horizon, removing the Sight- Vane 
lower; but when you perceive the Sky appear inftead of the Horizon, the Altitude is dimi- 
nifhed: therefore defift from farther Obfervation at that Time, and add the Degrees upon 
the Sixty Arc to the Degrees and Minutes upon the Thirty Arc, the Sum is the Zenith 
Diftance, or Co-altitude of the Sun's upper Limb. 

And becaufe it is the Zenith Diftance or vJo-altitude of the upper Limb of the Sun, that 
is aiven by the Quadrant, when obferving by the upper Edge of the Shade-Vane, as it is 
cuftomary to do, and not the Center ; you muft add 16 Min. the Sun's Semi-diameter, to 
that which is produced by your Obfervation, and the Sum is the true Zenith Diftance of the 
Sun's Center. But if you obferve by the lower part of the Shadow of the Shade- Vane, 
then the lower Limb of the Sun gives the Shadow ; and therefore you muft fubftract 16 Min. 
from what the Inftrument gives : but confidering the Height of the Obfervator above the 
Surface of the Sea, which is commonly between ,6 and 20 Feet, you may take five or fix 
Minutes from the 16 Minutes, and make the allowance but 10 Min. or 12 Min. to be added 
inftead of 16 Min. 

Note alfo, The Refraction of the Sun or Stars caufes them to appear higher than they are ; 
therefore after having made your Obfervation, you muft find the convenient Refraction, and 
fubftract it from your Altitude, or add it to the Zenith Diftance, in order to have the true 
Altitude or Zenith Diftance. 

If a Lens or double Convex-Glafs be fixed in the Shade- Vane, which contracts the Rays 
of Light, and cafts them in a imall bright Spot on the Slit of the Horizon-Vane inftead of 
a Shade, this will be an Improvement to the Inftrument if the Glafs be well fixed ; for then 
it may be ufed in hazy Weather, and that fo thick an Haze, that an Obfervation can hardly 
be made with the Foreftaff: alfo in clear Weather the Spot will be more defined than the 
Shadow, which at beft is not terminated. 

Of the Semi- circle for taking Altitudes at Sea. 
This Semi-circle is about one Foot in Diameter, and the Limb thereof is divided into 90 Fig. 13. 
Degrees only, each of which are quartered for 15 Min. At A and B are two Sights fixed 
to the Extremes of the Diameter, and another at C, fo adjuftcd as to Aide on the Limb of 
the Semi-circle, that fo the Sun's Rays may pafs thro' it when the Inftrument is ufing. 

The Ufe of the Semi- circle. 

If an Altitude is to be taken forwards by this Inftrument, the Eye muft be placed at the 
Sight A, and then you muft look thro' the Sights A and B at the Horizon, and Aide the 
Sight C on the Limb, 'till the Sun's Rays paffing thro' it, likewife come thro' the Sight A to 
the Eye. This being done, the Degrees of the Arc between B and C s fhew the Sun's Al- 
titude. 

But if the Sun's Altitude is to be taken backwards, which is the beft way, becaufe of its 
Splendor offending the Eye, you muft place the Eye to B, and looking thro' the Sights B 
and A, at the Horizon, you muft flide the Sight C along the Limb, 'till the Sun's Rays 
coming thro' it, fall upon the Sight A, and then the Arc B C will be the Sun's Altitude above 
the Horizon, as before. 

The Meridian Altitude or Zenith Diflance of the Sun or Stars being found by Obfervation, to find 

the Latitude of the Place. 

Having obferved with fome one of the Inftruments before fpoken of, the Meridian Alti- 
tude or Zenith Diftance of the Sun, or fome Star, feek the Sun's Declination the Day of 
Obfervation : if it be North, fubftract the Sun's Declination found from the Sun's Altitude, 
and you will have the Height of the Equinoctial above the Horizon, and this Fleight taken 
from 90 Degrees, and you will have the Latitude of the Place. But if the Zenith Diftance 
be added to the Declination of the Sun or Star, the Sum will be the Latitude of the Place. 

Again, If the Sun or Star have South Declination, you muft add the obferved Altitude 
to the Declination, and the Sum will be the Height of the Equinoctial above the Horizon, 
which taken from 90 Degrees, and the Latitude will be had. But if the Zenith Diftance 
be taken from the Declination, the Remainder will be the Latitude of the Place. 

Laftly, If the Sun has no Declination, his Altitude taken from 90 Degrees, will be the 
Latitude •, and fo in this Cafe the Zenith Diftance itfelf is the Latitude. 

Example. The Sun being in the firft Degree of Cancer, his Meridian Altitude at Paris is 
64 Deg. 30 Min. Zenith Diftance 25 Deg. 30 Min. his Declination 23 Deg. 30 Min. North. 
Now if 23 Deg. 30 Min. be taken from 64 Deg. 30 Min. the Remainder is 41 Deg. for the 
Altitude of the Equinoctial, and fo the Complement of 41 Deg. to 90 Peg. is 49 Deg. the 

G g g Height 



206 The Conflru&amp;ion and Ufes Book VII. 

Height of the Pole or Latitude of Paris •, but if the Zenith Diftance 25Deg. 30 Min. be 
added to the Sun's Declination 23 Deg. 30 Min. the Sum will be 49 Deg. the Latitude of Paris 
as before. 

Again, Suppofe the 22d of December (New Stile) the Sun's Meridian Altitude at Paris is 
obferved 17 Deg. 30 Min. and his Zenith Diftance 72 Deg. 30 Min. his Declination is then 
23 Deg. 30 Min. South, which added to 17 Deg. 30 Min. "and the Sum is 41 D?g. whofe 
Complement 49 Deg. is the Latitude of Paris. Again, If from the Zenith Dithance 72 
Deg. 30 Min. be taken the Declination, the Remainder will be 49 Deg. the Latitude of Paris, 
as before. 

CHAP. III. 

Of the Conftruttion and Ufes of the Sinecal Quadrant. 

Platen. nr 1 ^^ Inftrument is compofed of feveral Quadrants, having the fame Center A, and 

Fjg 1. X feveral parallel ftrait Lines croffing each other at Right Angles, both Quadrants and 

Right Lines being equally diftant from each other. Now one of thefe Quadrants, as BC, 

may be taken for a quarter or fourth part of any great Circle of the Sphere, and principally 

for a fourth Part of the Horizon and the Meridian. 

If the Quadrant BC be taken for one-fourth part of the Horizon, either of the Sides, as 
A B, may reprefent the Meridian, that is, the Line of North and South. And then the 
other Side AC, being at Right Angles with the Meridian, will reprefent the Line of Eaft 
and Weft. All the other Lines parallel to A B are alfo Meridians, and all thofe parallel to 
the Side AC, are Eaft and Weft Lines. 

The aforefaid Quadrant is firft divided into eight equal Parts by feven Radius's drawn 
from the Center A, which reprefent the eight Points of the Compafs contained in one- 
fourth of the Horizon, each of which is 1 1 Deg. 15 Min. the Arc BC is likewile divided 
into 90 Degrees, and each Degree divided into 12 Minutes, by means of Diagonals, drawn 
from Degree to Degree, and fix Concentrick Circles. There is likewife a Thread, as A L, 
fixed to the Center A, which being put over any Degree of the Quadrant, ferves to divide 
the Horizon as is neceffary. The Conftruction of the reft of this Inftrument, is enough ma- 
nifeft from the Figure thereof. 

The Ufe of the Sinecal Quadrant. 

There are formed Triangles upon this Inftrument fimilar to thofe made by a Ship's Way 
with the Meridians and Parallels, and the Sides of thefe Triangles are meafured by the 
equal Intervals between the Concentrick Quadrants, and the Lines N and S, E and O. 

Thefe Circles and Lines are diftinguifhed, by marking every fifth with broader Lines than 
the others ; fo that if every Interval be taken for one League, there will be five Leagues 
from one broad Line to the other ; and if every Interval be taken for four Leagues, then 
there will be twenty Leagues, which make a Sea Degree, from one broad Line to the 
other. 

Let us fuppofe, for example, that a Ship has failed 150 Leagues North-Eaft, one-fourth 
North, which is the third Point, and makes an Angle of 33 Deg. 45 Min. with the North 
part of the Meridian. Now we have two things given, viz. the Courfe, and Diftance 
failed, by which a Triangle may be found on this Inftrument fimilar to that made by the 
Ship's Courfe, and her Latitude and Longitude ; and fo the other unknown Parts of the 
Triangle found. And this is done thus : 

Let the Center A reprefent the Place of Departure, and count, by means of the Concen- 
trick Arcs, along the Point that the Ship failed on, as AD, 150 Leagues from A toD; 
then the Point D will be the Place the Ship is arrived at, which note with a Pin. This 
being done, let DE be parallel to the Side- AC, and then there will be formed a Right- 
angled Triangle A ED, fimilar to that made by the Ship's Courfe, difference of Latitude 
and Longitude: the Side A E of this Triangle gives 125 Leagues for the difference of 
Latitude Northwards, which make 6 Deg. 15 Min. reckoning 20 Leagues to a Degree, and 
one League for three Minutes. And laftly, the Side ED will give 83 leffer Leagues to- 
wards the Eaft, which being reduced in the manner hereafter fhewn, will give the difference 
of Longitude, and fo the whole Triangle will be known. 

Note, We call lefler Leagues thofe that anfwer to the Parallels of Latitude between the 
Equator and the Poles, which continually decreafe the nearer they are to the Pole, and con- 
fequently alfo the Degrees of Longitude ; and therefore the nearer a Ship fails to either of 
the Poles, the lefs way muft fhe make to alter her difference ot Longitude any determinate 
Number of Degrees. 

Since

Chao. 3.. the Sinecal Quadrant. 207 

Since the Center A always reprefents the Place of departure, it is manifeft that when 
the Point D of arrival is found, be it in what manner foever, all the Parts of the Triangle 
AED will afterwards be eafily determined. 

If the Sinecal Quadrant be taken for a fourth part of the Meridian, one Side thereof, 
as A B, may be taken for the common Radius of the Meridian, and the Equator; and the 
other fide AC, will then be half the Axis of the World. The Degrees of the Circumference 
BC, will reprefent the Degrees' of Latitude, and the Parallels to the Side A ±J perpendi- 
cular to AC, affumed from every Point of Latitude to the Axis A C, will be the Radius's 
of the Parallels of Latitude, as likewife the Sine-Compkments of thofe Latitudes. 

If, for Example, it be required to find how many Degrees of Longitude 83 lefTer Leagues 
make in the Parallel of 48 Deg. you mud firfb exctnd a Thread from the Center A, over the 
48th Dig. of Latitude on the Circumference ; and keeping it there, count the 83 Leagues 
propofed on the Side A B, beginning at the Center A. Thefe will terminate at H, in al- 
lowing every fmall Interval four Leagues, and the Interval between the broad Lines twenty 
Leagues. This being done, if the Parallel H G be traced out from the Point H to the 
Thread, the part AG of the Thread, (hews that 125 greater Leagues, or the equinoctial 
Leaoues, makes 6 Deg. 15 Mm. in allowing 20 Leagues to a Degree, and three Minutes for 
one League-, and therefore the 83 lefTer L agues AH, which make the difference of Lon- 
gitude of the fuppofed Courfe, and which are equal to the Radius of the Parallel G I, make 
6 Dtg. 15 Min. of the faid Parallel. 

Let it be required, for a fecond example, to reduce 100 lefTer Leagues into Degrees of 
Longitude on the Parallel of 60 Degrees. Having firft extended the Thread from the 
Center A over the 60th Degree on the Circumference, count the 100 Leagues of Longitude 
on the Side AB, and the Parallel terminating thereon being directed to the Thread, the 
part of the Thread affumed from the Center, fhews that 200 Leagues under the Equator 
make 10 Degrees •, that is, 100 Leagues in the Parallel of 60 Degrees make 10 Degrees 
of Longitude, fince every Degree of a great Circle is double to any Degree of the Parallel 
of 60 Degrees. 

On one Side of this Inftrument is put a Scale, called a Scale of Crofs Latitudes, whofe 
Conftruclion and Divifion is the fame as that of the Meridian Line of Mercator's Chart, of 
which we fhail fpeak by and by. The Ufe of this Scale is to find a mean Parallel between 
that of Departure and that of Arrival. 

When a Ship has failed on an oblique Courfe, that is, neither exactly North, South, Eafl, 
or Weft-, thele Courll-s, befides the North and South greater Leagues, give lejfer Leagues 
eaftwardly and weft hardly, which muft be reduced to Degrees of Longitude. L.ut thefe 
Leagues were made neither upon the Parallel of Departure, nor upon that of Arrival -, for 
they were made upon all the Parallels between thofe of Departure and Arrival, and are all 
unequal between thcmfelves, and conlequently we are necefiitat d to find a mean proportional 
Parallel between that of Departure and that of Arrival, which for this realon is called a 
mean Parallel, and ferves to reduce Leagues made in failing a-crofs divers Parallels, into 
Degrees and Minutes of the Equator. 

Now there are feveral ways of finding fuch a mean Parallel ; but I fhall only fpeak of 
that here, which is done by means of the Scale of increafed Latitude, without Calculation, and 
is thus : Let it be required, for example, to find a mean Parallel between that of 40 Deg. and 
that of 60 Deg. 

Take, by means of a Pair of CompafTes, the middle between the 40th and 60th Deg. upon 
this Scale, and the faid middle Point will terminate againft the 51ft Deg. which confequently 
will be the mean Parallel fought. 

Note, Becaufe this Scale is in two Lines, you muft take the Diflance from 40 Deg. of La- 
titude to 45 Deg. which is on one Side, and lay it off upon fome feparatc Right-Line. This 
being done, you muft take the Diflance from 45 D^g. to 60 Deg. which is on the other Side, 
and join thefe two Spaces together-, then half of thefe two Lines being taken between your 
CompafTes, you muft let one Eoot upon the Number 60, and the other Point will fall 
upon 51 Deg. which will be the mean Parallel fought. After which, it will be eafy to 
reduce the Leagues failed Eaftwardly into Degrees of Longitude, by the Sinecal Quadrant, 
confidered as a quarter of the Meridian, in the manner as we have laid down in the two 
Examples abovementioned. 

Of Mercator's Charts. 

This Figure reprefents a Mercator's Chart. But before we give the Conftrudtion and $■ 2&lt; 
Ufes thereof, it is neceffary to obferve that when a Ship fails upon any determinate Point 
of the Compals, fhe always makes the fame Angle with all the Meridians fhe pafTes over upon 
the Surface of the Terraqueous Globe. 

If a Ship fails North and South, fhe makes an infinitely acute Angle with the Meridian 
me defcribes, that i?, fhe runs parallel to it, or rather fails upon it. 

If a Ship fails due Eaft and Weft, fhe cuts all the Meridians at Right Angles ; for fhe 
either defcribes the Equator, or fome lefTer Circle which is parallel thereto. But if her 
Courfe be on any Point between the North and Eaft, North and Weft, Sooth and Eaft, or 
South and VYeu. then fhe will not defcribe a Circle ; becaufe a Circle drawn oblique to the 

Meridians, 



208 The ConftruBion and Ufes Book VII. 

Meridians, will cut all of them at unequal Angles, which the Ship muft not do while fhe 
fails upon any determinate Point, unlets North and South, or Eaft and Weft •, therefore 
fhe describes a Curve, not circular, whole efiential Property is to cut all the Meridians at 
the fame Angle. And this is called a Loxodromick Curve, or only Loxodromy, and is a 
kind of Spiral, making an Infinity of Revolutions towards a certain Point, which is the 
Pole, and every Turn thereof approaches nigher and nigher thereto. A Ship's Courfe then, 
except the two firft abovenamed, is always a Loxodromick Curve, and is the Hypothenufe 
of a Right-angled fpherical Triangle, whofe two other Sides are the Ship's Way in Lon- 
gitude and Latitude. Now we have the Latitude commonly given by Oblervation, and the 
Loxodromick Angle by the Compafs ; therefore by Trigonometry we may find the Hypothe- 
nufe, or the Way that the Ship has failed, &amp;c. 

But becaufe the Calculation of a Ship's Way by means of the Loxodromick Curve is 
troublefome, therefore the Ancients fought after fome Method whereby a Ship's Way might 
be a ftrait Line, which might nearly prcferve the Property of the Loxodromick Curve, 
which is, to cut all the Meridians under the fame Angle. But they found this abfolutely im- 
poffible upon the account of the Meridians not being parallel between themfelves, as in 
reality they are not. And therefore they fuppofed the Meridians to be parallel ftrait Lines ; 
and fo from this fuppofition it follows, that the Degrees of Longitude unequally diftanr. 
from the Equator, are of the fame bignefs •, whereas they really always diminifh from the 
Equator, in a certain known Proportion, which is as Radius is to the Sine-Complement of 
the Latitude. But to retrieve this Error, they have fuppofed the Degrees of Latitude, 
which by the Nature of the Sphere are every where equal, to be augmented in the fame 
Proportion as the Degrees of Longitude diminifh. And fo the Inequality which ought to 
be in the Degrees of Longitude of different Parallels, is thrown upon the Degrees of La- 
titude in the manner we are going to lay down. 

Now Charts made in this manner are called Mercator'% Charts, becaufe Mercator was the 
firft that made them •, and they are commonly efteemed the beft : for by the Experience of 
feveral Ages, it is found that Seamen ought to have vtry fimple Charts, wherein the 
Meridians, Parallels, and Rhumb-Lines, may be reprefented by ftrait Lines, that fo they 
may prick down their Courfes eafily.

CHAP. IV 

Of the ConjlruSiion and Ufes of Mercator'.? Charts. 

Fig. 2. I F the Degrees of Latitude are to be augmented as much as thofe of Longitude are 

J|[ found enlarged by making them equal to the Degrees of the Equinoctial, the Secants 
muft be ufed, which increafe in the fame Proportion as the Sine-Complements of the Lati- 
tudes (which ought to reprefent the Degrees of Longitude) have been increafed, by making 
them equal to the Radius of the Equator, becaufe of the Parallelifm of the Meridians: for 
the Sine- Complement of an Arc is to Radius, as Radius is to the Secant of that 
Arc. 

As, afiuming for one Degree of the Equator, and for the firft Degree of Latitude, the 
whole Radius, or fome aliquot part thereof; take for the 2d Degree of Latitude, the Secant 
of one Degree, or a fimilar aliquot part of this Secant ; and for the 3d Degree of Latitude, 
take the Secant of two Degrees, or the fimilar aliquot part thereof, and fo on. 

When a Chart is to be made large, you muft take, for 30 Minutes of Latitude, and 
30 Minutes of the Equator, the Radius of a Circle or fome aliquot part thereof, for one 
Degree of Latitude. This being done, you muft add continually the Secant of 30 Min. 
for 1 '- Degree of Latitude, the Secant of 1 Degree for 2 Degrees of Latitude, the Secant 
of 1^ Degree for 21 Degrees of Latitude, or their fimilar aliquot parts; and fo proceed 
on. In doing of which, we ufe a Scale of equal parts, from which the Secants as they are 
found in Tables are taken off, by taking away fome of the laft Figures. 

In thefe Charts the Scale is changed, according as the Latitude is; as, for example, if a 
Ship fails between the 40th and 50th Parallel of Latitude, the Degrees of the Meridians be- 
tween thofe two Parallels will ferve for a Scale to meafure the Ship's Way ; whence it fol- 
lows, that there are fewer Leagues on the Parallels, the nearer they are to the Poles, becaufe 
they are meafured by a Magnitude likewife continually increafing from the Equator towards 
the Poles. 

If, for example, a Chart of this kind be to be drawn from the the 40th Degree of North 
Latitude to the 50th, and from the 6th Degree of Longitude to the 18th: Firft draw the 
Line A B, reprefenting the 40th Parallel to the Equator, which divide into twelve equal 
Parts, for the 12 Degrees of Longitude, which the Chart is to contain. Tins being done, 
take a Sector or Scale, one hundred Parts whereof are equal to each of thefe Degrees of Longi- 
tude, and at the Points A and B raife two Perpendiculars to A 13, which will reprefent two 

parallel 



Chap. 4&gt; of MercatorV Charts. 209 

parallel Meridians, and muft be divided by the continual Addition of Secants. ,As, for the 
Diftance from 40 Deg. to 41 Deg. of Latitude, take 131 f equal Parts from your Scale, 
which is the Secant of 40 Deg. 30 Min. For the Diftance from 41 Deg. to 42 Deg. take 
J03 x. equal Parts from your Scale, which is the Secant of 41 Deg. 30 Min. For the Di- 
ftance from 42 Deg. to 43 Deg. take 136, which is the Secant of 42 Deg. ^o Min. and fo 
on to the laft Degree of your Chart, which will be 154 equal Parts, viz. the Secant of 49 
I&gt;g. 30 Min. and" will give the Diftance from 49 Deg. of Latitude to 50 Deg. and by this 
means the Degrees of Latitude will be augmented in the fame Proportion as the Degrees of 
Longitude on the Globe do really decreafe. 

Having divided the Meridians, you may place the Card upon the Chart, for doing of which, 
ehufe a convenient Place towards the Middle thereof, as the Point R, about which, as a 
Center, defcribe a Circle fo big that it's Circumference may be divided into 32 equal Parts, 
for the 32 Points of the Com pais. Then having drawn a Line towards the Top of the Chart, 
pirallel to the two divided Meridians, this will be the North Rhumb, and upon it a Flower- 
de-Luce muft be put, that thereby all the other Rhumbs or Points may be known, the princi- 
pal of which ought to be diftinguifhed from the others by broader Lines. 

After this, all the Towns, Ports, Iflands, Coafts, Sands, Rocks, i£c. which form the 
Chart, muft be laid down upon the fame, according to their true Latitudes and Longitudes. 
And if the Chart be large, there may feveral Cards be placed thereon, always with their 
North and South Lines parallel between themfclvts. 

The Ufe of Mercator'j Charts, 

The chief Ufe of a Sea-Chart, is to find the Point of Departure therein, the Point ar- 
rived at, the Courfe, the Diftance failed, the Longitude and the Latitude, as we fhall now 
explain by fome Examples. 

Example I. Suppofe a Ship is to fail from the Ifiand de OueJJant, in 48 Deg. 30 Min. of 
North Latitude, and 13 Deg. 30 Min. of Longitude, to Cape Finijler in Galicia, which is 
in 43 Deg. of Latitude, and 8 Deg. of Longitude. Now the Point of the Compafs the Ship 
muft keep to, as alfo the Diftance between the faid two Places is required. In order to do 
this, you muft imagine a Line drawn from the Ifiand de OueJJant to Cape Finijler., and with 
a Pair of Compafles examine what Point on the Chart that Line is parallel to, and this 
Point, which is South-Weft, one-fourth South, is that which the Ship muft fail on. 

But to find the Diftance of the two Places, take between your Compafles the Extent of 
live Degrees on the Meridian againft the beforenamed Courfe, that is, from the 43d Deg* 
to the 48th •, and this will be a Scale of 100 Leagues. This being done, fet one Foot of 
your Compafles thus opened upon the Ifiand de OueJJant, and the other Foot upon the occult 
Line tending to Cape Finijler, making a little Mark thereon ; and this Extent of the Com- 
pafles will give 100 Leagues of Diftance. Then take the Diftance from the aforefaid Mark 
to Cape Finijler between your Compafles, and placing one Foot upon the 43d Deg. of the 
Meridian, and the other Foot will fall upon 44 Deg. 45 Min. which amounts to 35 Leagues \ 
and confequently the whole Diftance between Cape Finijler and the Ifland de OueJJant is 135 
Leagues. 

Example IT. A Ship failing from the Ifland de OueJJant South-Weft, one-fourth South, to- 
wards Cape Finijler, and the Mafter-Pilot having examined the Force of the Wind, and the 
Number of Sails fyrcad, and knowing by experience the Swiftnefs of his Ship, has eftimated 
her Way to have been 50 Leagues in 20 Hours. Now to find the Point upon the Chart 
wherein the Ship is, he muft take the Extent of 2 \ Degrees, equivalent to 50 Leagues, 
between his Compafles, upon the Meridian, from the 46th Deg. to the 48 f Deg. This 
being done, if one Foot of the Compafles thus opened be fet upon the Place of Departure, 
the other Foot will fall upon the Point T, the Place wherein the Ship is, on the Line of the 
Ship's Way. But if the Longitude and Latitude of the Point T, or Place wherein the 
Ship is, be fought, he muft place one Foot of the Compafles upon the Point T, and the 
other upon the neareft Parallel, and then conduct the Compafles thus opened perpendicu- 
larly along the Parallel to the Meridian and the Degree thereof whereat the Point of the Com- 
pafles comes to, will be the Latitude of the Point T. And to find the Longitude of this 
Point, he muft fet one Foot of the Compafles therein, and the other upon the neareft Me- 
ridian. Then if this Foot be Aid along the Meridian (fo that a Line joining the two Points 
be always parallel to itlelf) to the divided Parallel, he will have, upon that Parallel, the 
Longitude of the Point T. 

Becaufe Meridians and Parallels are not drawn a-crofs the Chart, to the end that the 
Rhumb-Lines may not be con fu fed, therefore you may ufe a Ruler, which will produce the 
fame Effect. 

Example III. The Courfe being given, and the Latitude by Obfervation ; to find the 
Diftance failed, and to prick down the Place of the Ship upon the Chart. Suppofe a Ship 
departed from the Ifland de OueJJant is arrived to a Place whofe Latitude, by Obfervation, is 
found to be 46 Degrees •, take, between your Compafles, the Diftance from the 46th 
Degree of the Meridian to the 48 f, which is the Latitude of the Place of Departure, 
over which 48 ' Degree and the Ifland de OueJJant having laid a Ruler, Aide one Foot of 

Hhh the 



2, to The ConftruBion and C/fes, &amp;c. Book VII. 

the -Compafles thus opened along the Side of this Ruler, 'till the other Foot interiecls the 
Line of the Ship's Way ; then the Point of Interferon S will be that whereat the Ship 
was at the Time of Obfervation. Now to find the Diftance failed, you muft extend the 
Compafifes from this Point S to the Place of Departure, and lay off this Extent upon the 
Meridian, which will reach from the 46th Degree to the 49th ; and confequently the Di- 
ftance failed will be 60 Leagues, allowing 20 Leagues to a Degree. 

Example IV. The Latitude and Longitude of a Place being given, to fjnd that Place in 
the Chart. Having placed one Foot of a Sea-Chart Compafs upon the known Degree of La- 
titude, and the other upon the nigheft Parallel, you muft place with your other Hand one 
Foot of another Pair of Compaffes upon the known Degree of Longitude on the Meridian, 
and the other Foot upon the neareft Meridian •, and then Aide both thefe Pair of Compafles 
until their two Points meet each other : for then the Point of Concourfe will be that fought. 
This Operation is very much ufed by Seamen ; for the Point where they are, being firft 
found by Calculation, or the Sinecal Quadrant, they can by this means prick down the Place 
of the Ship upon the Chart, and fo it will be eafy for them to find what Courfe the Ship 
muft fteer to continue on her Voyage.

Remarks and Definitions appertaining to Dialling. 



!$lil?§^W UN-Dials take their Name from the principal Circles of i 
r^'ii^^^W t ' ic y are P ara " e ' : as &gt; a Horizontal-Dial is one parallel t 
limil Equinoctial-Dial one parallel to the Equinoctial j a Verti 



the Sphere to which 
to the Horizon ; an 
cal-Dial one that is 



Equinoctial-Dial one parallel to the Equi 
parallel to a Vertical Circle ; and fo of others. 

There are two iorts of Styles placed on the Surfaces of Dials ; one is called 
a Right Style, which is a pointed Iron-Rod, that fhews the Hour or Part on 
a Dial by the Shadow of its Extremity •, and the other is called an oblique or inclined Style, 
or elfe the Axis, which fhews the Time of Day upon a Dial by the Shadow of the whole 
Length thereof. 

The Extremity of the right Style of any Dial, reprefents the Center of the World and 
Equator, and the Plane of a Dial is fuppofed to be as far diftant from the Center of the 
Earth, as is the Length of the right Style. For becaufe the Sun's Diftance from the Center 
of the Earth is fo great, and the Diftance of any Point in the Earth's Superficies from the 
Center is fo fmall, compared with the Sun's Diftance ; therefore any Point on the Earth's 
Surface may without any fenfible Error be taken for its Center : and fo the Extremity of 
the Style of any Dial may be taken for the Center of the Earth ; and a Line parallel to the 
Axis of the World, which paffes thro' the Extremity of the Style, may be confidered as the 
Axis of the World. 

The Hour-Lines, which are drawn upon Dial-Planes, are the Interferons of the faid 
Planes made by the Hour-Circles of the Sphere. 

The Center of a Dial, is the Interfection of its Surface with the Axis of the Dial palling 
thro' the Extremity of the Style parallel to the Axis of the World ; and in this Center all 
the Hour-Lines meet each other. 

All Dial-Planes may have Centers, except Eaft, Weft, and Polar ones •, for on thefe the 
Hour- Lines are all parallel between themfelves. 

The Vertical Line of a Dial- Plane, is a Pependicular drawn from the Extremity of the 
Style to the Foot thereof ; but the Vertical Line of the Place wherein the Dial is, is a right 
Line perpendicular to the Horizon drawn thro' the Extremity of the Style. 

Dials have like wife two Meridians •, one of which is the fubftylar Line or proper Meri- 
dian of the Dial-Plane, becaufe its Circle paffes thro' the Vertical Line of the Dial-Plane-, 
and the other, which is the Meridian of the Place, hath its Meridian Circle paffing thro' the 
Vertical Line of the Place. 

When a Dial declines neither to the Eaft or Weft, the fubftylar Line, or Meridian of the 
Plane, coincides with the Meridian of the Place or Hour-Line of 12, let the Surface of the 
Dial be Vertical, Horizontal, or even inclined upwards or downwards. 

The Horizontal Line of a Dial-Plane, is the common Section of the faid Plane, and a 
horizontal or level Line paffing thro' the Extremity of the Style ; and the Equinoctial Line is the 
common Section of the Dial- Plane and Equinoctial Circle : and this Line is always perpen- 
dicular to the fubftylar Line ; and confequendy if the Pofition of the fubftylar Line be 
known, and a Point of the Equinoctial Line be given, we may likewife have the Pofition of 
the Equinoctial Line : and contrariwife, if the Equinoctial Line be given, we may have the 

fubftylar 



212 ^he Conflruclion and Ufes Book VIII, 

fubftylar Line, which is perpendicular thereto. Note, This fubftylar Line muft pafs thro' 
the Foot of the Style and the Center of the Dial. 

The Hour- Line of fix always palTts thro' the Interfection of the Horizontal and Equi- 
noctial Lines in declining Dials ; and fo the faid Point of Interfection is one Point of the 
Hour-Line of fix. Note, The Point wherein the Subftyle and Meridian Lines meet, is the 
Center of the Dial. 

When a Dial is to be drawn upon a Plane, you mud firft find the Pofition of the faid 
Plane, or of the Wall it is to be fet up againft, with regard to the Sun and the prin- 
cipal Circles of the Sphere: And this may be done, in obferving feveral Times the fame 
Day, at every 3 or 4 Hours interval, where the Shadow of the Extremity of a Style 
falls upon the Dial-Plane: for by this means the Pofition of the Dial- Plane may be deter- 
mined, and afterwards all the Hour-Lines, &amp;e. may be drawn thereon in the manner 
we mail hereafter (hew. Note, The Exactnefs of a Dial very much depends upon thefe 
Points. 

CHAP. I- 

Of Regular and Irregular Dials, drawn upon Planes and Bodies 

of different Figures. 

Plate 11 ^ Jj ^ H I S Inftrument reprefents a hollow Body, having 14 Planes, upon each of which a 
pi u ' J[ Dial may be drawn. 

The upper Plane A, is parallel to the Horizon •, and fo upon this a Horizontal-Dial is 
drawn, as well as upon the under Plane E, whereon the Sun mines but a very little. The 
Plane B is parallel to the Axis of the World, and makes an Angle of 49 Degrees with the 
Horizon of Paris ; for the Latitude of which, all the Dials are iuppofed to be drawn. Now 
upon this Plane is drawn an upper Polar Dial, and upon the Plane F, which is oppofite 
thereto, is drawn an under Polar Dial. The Plane C is parallel to the Prime Vertical, and 
fince it faces the South, there is drawn thereon a South Vertical Dial, And upon the op- 
pofite Plane to this, which is towards G, and faces directly to the North, is drawn a Vertical 
North Dial, which cannot be reprefented in this Figure. 

The Plane H, which is parallel to the Equinoctial, and fo makes an Angle with the Ho- 
rizon of 41 Deg. viz. the Complement of the Latitude of Paris, hath an upper Equinoctial 
Dial drawn upon it; and upon the oppofite Plane D, is drawn an under Equinoctial Dial. 
The Plane K is parallel to the Plane of the Meridian, and becaufe it directly faces the 
Weft, a Meridional Welt Dial is drawn thereon, and upon the oppofite Plane to this is 
drawn a Meridional Eaft Dial. The Plane I makes an Angle 45 Deg. with the Meridian ; 
and therefore there is drawn upon it a vertical Decliner, declining Southweltwardly 45 Deg. 
and upon the oppofire Plane to this is drawn a North-Eait Decliner of 45 Deg. Finally, 
The Plane L declines North-Weft 45 Deg. and its Oppofite 45 Deg. South-Eaft ; and fo upon 
thefe two Planes are drawn North- Weft and South-Eaft Decliners. 

The firft Nine of the abovementioned Dials, are called Regular ones 5 and the Four 
others, which decline, are called Irregular Dials. 

The Axes of all thefe Dials are parallel to each other, and to the Axis of the World. We 
mall hereafter give the Conftruction of all thefe Dials, as well as of thofe on the following 
Inftrument, of which we are going to fpeak. 

Tbe Conjlruclion of Dials drawn upon a Dodecahedron. 
Pi-. 2 _ This Figure is one of the five Regular Bodies, of which we have fpoken in the firft 

Book. This Body is called a Dodecahedron, and is terminated by 12 equal Pentagons, upon 
every of which may be drawn a Dial, except on the undermoft. 

The Plane A being Horizontal, hath a Horizontal-Dial drawn thereon, whofe Hour-Line 
of 12 bifects one of the Angles of the Pentagon. Upon the Plane B, which faces the 
South, is drawn a direct South-Dial, inclining towards the Zenith, or upwards 63 Deg. 
26 Min. The Center of this Dial is upwards, and the fubftylar Line is the Hour- Line of 12. 
The oppofite Plane to this, is a North vertical one, inclining downwards or towards the 
Nadir 63 Deg. 26 Min. and fo there is drawn thereon a North inclining Dial, whofe Center 
is downwards. 

The Dial C, is a South-Eaft inclining Recliner, whofe Declination is 36 Deg. and Inclina- 
tion to the Zenith 63 Deg. 26 Min. and its Center is downwards. The Dial D is a North- 
Eaft Decliner of 72 Deg. inclining towards the Nadir 61 l&gt;g. 26 Min. the Center being 
upwards, and its oppofite is a South- Weft Decliner of 72 Deg. inclining towards the Zenith 
^3 Deg 26 Min. the Center being downwards. 

The 



:&gt; 



Chap. i. of Sun-Dials. 21" 

The Dial E is a North-Eaft Decliner of 36 Deg. and inclines towards the Zenith 63 Deg. 
26 Min. the Center being downwards. The oppofite Dial to this, is a South- Weft Decliner 
of 36 Deg. and inclines towards the Nadir 63 Deg. 26 Min. it's Center being upwards. Fi- 
nally, the Dial F is a South- Eaft Decliner of 72 Deg. inclining towards the Zenith 63 Deg. 
26 Min. the Center being downwards ; and it's oppofite is a North- Weft Decliner of 72 De?. 
inclining towards the Nadir 63 Deg. 26 Min. the Center thereof being upwards. 

All thefe Dials are furniflied with their Axes, which are parallel between themfelves, and 
to the Axis of the World. 

Now if one of thefe Bodies of Dials be {ct upon a Pedtftal, in a Place well expofed to 
the Sun, and then be fet right by means of a Compafs or Meridian Line, drawn in the Man- 
ner we mall hereafter fhew •, all the Dials that the Sun mines upon will fhew the fame Hour 
or Part at the fame Time by the Shadows of the Styles. 

But if a Dodecahedron of Dials be to be placed upon a Pedeftal fixed in a Garden, it 
ought to be made of folid Matter, as Stone or good Wood, well painted to preferve it from 
Rain, &amp;c. therefore it will be here necefTary to fhew how to cut out a Dodecahedron. 

Take a Stone cut out into a perfect Cube, and divide each of the four Sides of it's Faces Fig. 3. 
into two equal Parts, by two Diameters AC, BD. And at the Points A and C, make the 
Angles E AF, and H C G, each 116 Deg. 34 Min. that is, make Angles at the Points A 
and C, on each fide the Diameter A C, of 58 Deg. 17 Min each : becaufe all the Surfaces of 
the Dodecahedron make Angles of 116 Deg. 34 Min. with each other-, therefore two Faces 
thereof being horizontally placed, all the others will incline 63 Deg. 26 Min. the Complement 
of 116 Deg. 34 Min. to 180 Deg. Now the Space between F and G, or E H, will be the 
Length of each fide of the Pentagons, half of which, viz. BF, muft be taken and laid off 
both ways from the Point I to the Points Q^and X. And this muft be done upon the Dia- 
meters crofting each other on all the other Faces of the Cube. Afterwards the Stone muft be 
cut away along the Diameters to the Extremities of the Sides of the Pentagons : for Example, 
you muft cut away the Stone down, or ail along the Diameter KM, in a Right Line to the 
Point Qjn the firft Surface of the Cube, as likewife all along the Diameter L N ftrait for- 
wards to the Point S, and again all along the tJiameter B D directly forward to the Point 
T. And proceeding in this manner with the other Faces of the Cube, you may compleat 
your Dodecahedron. But it will be very proper for a Perfon that has a mind to cut out one 
of thefe Bodies, to have a Pafte'ooard one before him, thereby to help his Imagination, that 
fo he may know better wnat Angles and Sides to cut away. 

Cylinders may be cut likewife into Dodecahedrons, but let the Method above given fuf- 
fice. 

We make alfo very curious Dials on the Faces of fmall brafs Dodecahedrons. 

The Conjlruftion of an Horizontal Dial. 

The fourth Figure is an Horizontal Dial : To make which, firft draw the two Lines A B, pi g&gt; , • 
C D, cutting each other at Right Angles in the Point E, which will be the Center of the 
Dial, the Line A B the Meridian or Hour-Line of 12, and the Line CD the Hour-Line 
of 6. This being done, make the Angle B E F, 49 Deg. equal to the Elevation of the Pole 
at Paris (the Elevation of the Pole at Paris is but 48 Deg 5 1 Min. but we neglect the nine 
Minutes, as being but of fmall Confequence in the Conftruction of Dials) and the Line 
EF will reprefent the Axis of the World. In this the Point G muft be chofen at pleafure, 
reprelenting the Center of the Earth, and G H muft be drawn at Right Angles to E F, 
cutting the Meridian or Hour-Line of 12 in the Point H. This Line G H reprefents the 
Radius of the Equinoctial. Now take H G between your Compaff s, which lay off from 
H to B on the Meridian Line, and draw the Right Line L H K perpendicular to the Meri- 
dian, which will reprefent the common Section of the Equinoctial, and the Plane of the 
Dial : then about the Point B, as a Center, defcribe the Quadrant M H, which divide into 
fix equal Arcs, each of which will be 15 Deg. and draw the dotted Lines B 5, B 4, B 3, 
B 2, B 1. Thefe will divide the Line L H into the Points 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, thro' which 
Points, if Lines be drawn from the Center E of the Dial, you will have the Hour-Lines of 
1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, on. one fide the Meridian; and becaufe the Hour-Lines equally diftant on 
both fides from the Meridian make equal Angles with the Meridian, therefore if the Divifions 
*» 2 &gt; 3&gt; A-&gt; 5&gt; on one fide tne Meridian, be laid off from H towards K on the other fide, 
and thro' the Points where they terminate are drawn Lines from the Center E ; thefe will be 
the Hour-Lines of 11, 10, 9, 8, 7. And if the Hour-Lines of 7 and 8 in the Morning 
are continued out beyond the Center, they will give the Hour-Lines of 7 and 8 in the Even- 
ing, and likewife the Hour-Lines of 4 and 5 in the Afternoon continued out in the fame 
manner, will give thofe of 4 and 5 in the Morning. Note y Inftead of drawing the Quadrant 
M H, we might, for greater facility, have only drawn an Arc greater than 60 Deg. for then 
if an Arc of 60 Deg. had been taken upon it from the Point H, by means of it's Chord, 
which is equal to Radius, and the faid Arc had been divided in four equal Arcs, each of 15 
Deg. and another Arc of 15 Deg. had been added to that of 60 Deg. for the Hour of 5, 
we might have drawn the Lines ii 1, 82, B 3, &amp;c. as we have already done. 

I i i Now 



2xa The Conflru&amp;ion and Ufcs Book VIII. 

Now to draw the Half-hours, you muft bifect each of the Arcs of 15 Deg. on the Qua- 
drant M H, in order to have Arcs of 7 Deg. 30 Min. and for the Quarters, each of thefe lad 
Arcs muft be again bifected -, and thro' each Point of Divifion occult Lines muft be drawn 
from the Center B, cutting the Equinoctial Line K L. Then if the Edge of a Ruler be laid 
thro' thefe Points of Concourfe and the Center E of the Dial, the Halfs and Quarters of 
Hours may be drawn. 

The Hour-Lines being drawn upon your Dial, you may give it what Figure you pleafe, as 
a Parallelogram, regular Pentagon, fcfr. 

This Dial being fixed upon a very level Plane, that is, fet parallel to the Horizon, expofed 
to the Sun, and it's Hour-Line of 12 placed exactly North and South •, as alio the Style or 
Axis E H F being raifed perpendicularly upon the Hour- Line of 12, fo as E F be parallel to 
the Axis of the World: I fay, if thefe things be fo ordered, the Shadow of the Axis or 
Style will fhew the Hour of the Day from Sun-rifing to Sun-fetting. 

The ConJirutJion of a N on- declining Vertical Dial. 
F 'g« 5- This Dial is parallel to the Prime Vertical, which cuts the Meridian at Right Angles, 

and partes thro' the Eaft and Weft Points of the Horizon. The Manner of drawing it is 
thus : Firft draw the Lines EB and C D at Right Angles, the fir ft of which fhall be the 
Hour-Line of 12, and the other the Hour-Line of 6 ; then make the Angle B E F at the 
Point E, the Center of the Dial, equal to the Complement of the Elevation of the Pole, which 
at Paris is 41 Deg. and raife the Line I G perpendicularly on the Meridian ; this will be the 
right Style, and the Point I is the Foot thereof, and G the Extremity, which, as above faid, 
may be taken for the Center of the Earth : and this Line both ways produced, will be the 
Horizontal-Line. 

From the Point G, in the Right Line E G F, which rcprefents the Axis of the World, 
raife the Line G H at Right Angles thereto, cutting the Meridian in B. This Line G H 
fhall reprefent the Radius of the Equinoctial, and the Line L H K, drawn thro' the Point 
H, cutting the Meridian at Right Angles, reprefents the common Section of the Equinoctial 
and the Plane of the Dial. Now make H B equal to H G, and about the Point B, as a 
Center, defcribe the Quadrant of a Circle M H, which divide into 6 equal Arcs, each of 
which will be 15 Deg. by dotted Lines, dividing the Line LK into unequal Parts, which 
fhall be the Tangents of the faid Arcs. Finally, If thro' thofe Points of Divifion and the 
Center E, you draw Lines, they will be the Hour-Lines on one fide of the Meridian ; and 
for drawing the Hour-Lines on the other fide the Meridian, as alio the Halves and Quarters 
of Hours, you muft do as is fhewn in the Horizontal-L^ial. 

This Dial is fet up againft a Wall, or on a very upright Plane, directly facing the South ; 
for which reafon it is called a Meridional Vertical Dial : it's Meridional or Hour-Line of 12 
muft be perfectly upright, and it's Horizontal-Line level. The Center thereof is upwards, 
and it's Axis points towards the under Pole. The oppofite Dial to this, is a Vertical North 
one, having the Center downwards, and the Extremity of it's Axis pointing to the upper 
Pole of the World. The Conftruction of this latter Dial is the fame as that of the other, 
the Flour-Lines and the Axis making the fame Angles with the Meridian, as they do on 
that. But the Sun fhines but a fmall time upon this Dial, and this only in the Summer- 
time, viz. in the Morning from his rifing 'till he has paffed the Prime Vertical, and in the 
Evening from the time he has again paffed the Prime Vertical 'till his fetting. When the Sun 
defcribes the Summer Tropick, he rifes at Paris, at 4 in the Morning, and comes to the 
Prime Vertical between 7 and 8 in the Morning ; and in the Afternoon he repaffes the Prime 
Vertical between 4 and 5, and fets at 8. Therefore we need only draw the Hour-Lines 
upon this Dial from 4 in the Morning to 8, and from 4 in the Afternoon to 8 ; at which 
time the Sun fhines upon the Meridional Vertical Dial, but from about 8 in the Morning to 
about 4 in the Afternoon. But when the Sun by his annual Motion is again come back to 
the Equinoctial, he will not fhine at all upon the Vertical North Dial till after he has croffed 
the Equinoctial again ; and all this time he will fhine upon the Meridional Vertical Dial from 
his rifing to his fetting. 

The Conftrutlion of a Polar Dial. 

Fig. 6. The 6th Figure reprefents an upper Polar Dial, which is one that inclines upwards, but 

does not decline : for it is parallel to the Axis of the World, and the Hour-Circle of 6, 
which cuts the Meridian at Right Angles. And for this reafon the Hour of 6 in the 
Morning or Evening can never be fhewn by this Dial ; for the Shadow of the Style being 
then parallel to the Plane of the Dial, cannot be caft upon it. This Dial likewife hath no 
Center, and the Hour-Lines are all parallel betv/een themfelvcs, and to the Axis of the 
World. The Plane therefore being parallel to the Horizon of a right Sphere, paffes thro' the 
two Poles of the World, from whence comes the Name of a Polar Dial. 

The Manner of drawing this Dial is thus : Firft draw the Line A B reprefenting the 
Equinoctial, and I D at Right Angles thereto, for the Meridian or Hour-Line of 12. Then 
affume the Length of the Style at pleafure, according to the bignefs of the Plane the Dial 
is to be drawn on -, let this be CD, about the Extremity of which D defcribe a Quadrant, 

which 



Chap. i. of Sun-Dials. 2I r 

which divide into fix equal Arcs (or onlydefcribe an Arc of 60 Degrees, which divide into 
four Parts, of 15 Degrees each, for the four firft Hours after Noon, and then' add an Arc 
of 15 Degrees for the flour of 5.)- This being done, draw dotted Lines from the Point D, 
thro' the Divilions of the Circumference of the faid Arc, to the Line AB ; and then if 
Lines are drawn thro' the Points wherein the dotted Lines cut the Line AB, parallel to the 
Meridian, thefe Lines will be the Hour-Lines on one fide the Meridian: and if there be as 
many Parallels drawn on the other fide the Meridian, at the fame Diftances therefrom as 
the refpective parallel Hour-Lines are on the other fide, thefe will be the Hour-Lines on the 
other fide of the Meridian. The Style of this Dial muft be equal in Length to C F, the 
Diftance from the Hour-Line of 3 to the Hour-Line of 12, and may be made in figure of a 
Right-angled Parallelogram, as is that marked above the Letter K in the Figure of the 
Dial. This Style is let upon the Hour-Line of 12, which for this Reafon is called the Sub* 
ftylar Line. 

If a fingle Rod only be ufed for a Style, as that which is in the Point C of the Meridian, 
then the Hour will be fhewn upon this Dial by the Shadow of the Extremity of the Style j 
whereas when a Parallelogram is ufed, we have the Hour fhewn by the Shadow of one ot 
ics Sides, that is, by a right Line. 

An upper Polar Dial may fhew the Hour from feven in the Morning to five in the After- 
noon ; and an under Polar one is ufelefs, unlefs in the Summer, wherein the Hour is fhewn 
thereby, from the Sun's rifing to five in the Morning, and from kven in the Evening 'till his 
fetting: and fo for the Elevation of the Pole of Paris, the Hours of four and five in the 
Morning, and feven and eight in the . Tternoon, are only fet down upon this Dial-, and 
thefe may be drawn as thofe on the upper Po&lt;ar Dial, for tile Diftances of the Hour-Lines of 
four and five in the Afternoon from the Subftyle, on the upper Polar Dial, are equal to the 
Diftances of the Hour-Lines of four and five in the Morning from the Subftyle on the 
under Polar Dial. Underftand the fame for the Hours of feven and eight in the Afternoon ; 
and therefore there is no need of drawing the Figure of this Dial. Note, The Diftance of 
the Hour-Lines on thefe Dials depend upon the Breadth of the Style, or the Diftance of the 
Point D from the Equinoctial Line. 

To fet up this Dial at Pan's, the Plane thereof muft make an Angle of 49 Deg. with the 
Horizon, the upper one facing the Sky directly South, that fo the Axis thereof may be 
parallel to that of the World, and the oppofite Dial to this, viz. the under Polar one faces 
downwards, the Morning Hours being, towards the Weft, and the Afternoon ones towards 
the Eaft, on both the upper and under ones. 

Now if the Horizontal Line is to be drawn upon this Dial, defcribe the Arc GH, 
about the Point F, the Extremity of the Style, equal to the Elevation of the Pole, viz. 
49 Deg. for the Latitude of Paris, and draw the Right Line F H, cutting the Meridian in 
the Point I, thro' which draw the Horizontal Line L K, at Right Angles. Now by means 
of this Line, we may know whether the Dial be well placed, and have its convenient In- 
clination ; for if the Dial be inclined rightly, a Plane laid along the Horizontal Line, and 
fupported by the Edge of the Style, will be level or parallel to the Horizon. 

A Polar Dial in a right Sphere is parallel to the Horizon, and in a parallel Sphere it is 
vertical or upright. 

The ConftruRion of an EquinoRial Dial. 

An upper Equinoctial Dial fhews the Hour but only fix Months in the Year, viz. from Fig. 7; 
the Vernal Equinox to the Autumnal one ; and the oppofite Dial to this, which is an under 
Equinoctial one, fhews the Hour during the other fix Months of the Year, viz. from the 
Autumnal Equinox to the Vernal one. 

The Plane of this Dial is parallel to the Equinoctial Circle, and is cut at Right Angles 
through the Center thereof by the Axis of the World. 

The Conftruction of this Dial is thus : Draw two Right Lines AH, and ED, crofting 
each other at Right Angles, the firft of which fhall be the Hour-Line of 12, and the 
other the Hour-Line of 6 ; then about the Point A of Interferon defcribe a Circle, each 
quarter of which divide into fix equal Parts, thro' which, if ftrait Lines be drawn from the 
Center A, thefe Lines will be the Hour-Lines, becaufe they each make equal Angles of 
15 Deg. and if each of thefe Angles be halved and quartered, the halves and quarters of 
Hours will be had. 

The Conftruction of an under Equinoctial Dial is the fame as of an upper one ; and in a 
parallel Sphere, viz. where the Pole is in the Zenith, there is but one Equinoctial Dial, which 
will likewife be there an Horizontal one. And in a right Sphere, viz. where the two Poles 
are in the Horizon, thefe Dials are non-declining Vertical ones &gt; ar &gt;d are fet up againft 
Walls, one of which faces the North Pole, and the other the South Pole, the Sun fhining 
upon each fix Months in the Year. But in an oblique Sphere, as that which we inhabit, 
thefe Diais are inclined to the Horizon, and make an Angle therewith equal to the Comple- 
ment of the Latitude, viz. at Paris, an Angle of 41 Deg. 

The Axis of an Equinoctial Dial is a ftrait Iron Rod going thro' the Center of the Dial 
perpendicular to the Plane thereof, and parallel to the Axis of the World. The Length of 

* this 



2i6 ^ e ConJlruSJion andUfes Book VIII. 

this Rod may be at pleafure, when it hath no other Ufe but fhewing the Hour by the Shadow 
thereof; but when the Length of the Days, and the Sun's Place are to be fhewn thereby, the. 
faid Rod muft have a determinate Length, as we (hall fhtw hereafter. 

The ConftruElion of Eqft and IVefi Dials. 

Fig. 8. Thefe Dials are parallel to the Plane of the Meridian •, one of which direcTtly faces the Eaft, 

and the other the Weft. The 8th Figure is a Weft Dial, having the Hour-Lines parallel to 
each other, and to the Axis of the World, as in a Polar Dial, and their Conftruction is near- 
ly the fame as of the Hour-Lines on a Polar Dial. 

This Dial is made thus : Firft draw the right Line A B, rcprefenting the Horizontal Line, 
and about the Point A, affume the Arc B C of a Radius at pleafure in this Line, equal to the 
Complement of the Latitude, or Height of the Equator above the Horizon, which at Paris 
is 41 Deg. Then draw the Line C D, produced, as is necefTary, from the Point C, and 
this Line fhall reprefent the common Section of the Equinoctial and Plane of the Dial ; after 
this, draw ED from the Point D, parallel to the Equinoctial Line, and this Line ED will 
be the Place of the Subftyle, that is, the Line on which the Style muft be placed ; as like- 
wife the Hour-Line of Six. Now to draw the other Flour-Lints, affume the Point E at 
pleafure on the fubftylar Line, about which, as a Center, defcribe an Arc of 60 Deg. which 
divide into four equal Parts for 15 Deg. each, beginning from the fubftylar Line. After 
this, lay off as many Arcs of 15 Deg. as is necefTary upon the faid Arc both ways continued, 
and draw dotted Lines from the Center E thro' all the Divifions of the Arc to the Equi- 
noctial Line : then if right Lines .be drawn thro' the Points in the Equinoctial Line, made by 
the dotted Lines, parallel to the Hour-Line of 6, and perpendicular to the Equinoctial 
Line •, thefe Lines will be the Hour-Lines. Note., This Dial fhews the Time of Day after 
Noon to the Setting of the Sun •, and fince the Sun fets (at Paris) at Eight o'Clock in the 
Summer, we have pricked down the Flour-Lines from One to Eight in this Dial, as appears 
fer Figure. 

The Conftruction of an Eaft Dial is the fame as of this ; and there are pricked down the 
Hour-Lines upon it from the Sun's rifing in Summer, viz. from Four in the Morning to 
Eleven. The reafon that the Hour-Line of Twelve cannot be drawn upon thefe Dials, 
is, becaufe when the Sun is in the Meridian, his Rays are parallel to their Planes. 

If a Weft Dial be drawn upon a Sheet of Paper, and then the faid Paper is rendered 
Tranfparent by oiling, you will perceive thro' the backfide of the Paper an Eaft Dial drawn 
entirely •, only the Figures of the Hours muft be altered, that is, you muft put 1 1 in the 
Place of 1 •, 10 in the Place of 2 ; and fb ot others. 

The Style of thefe Dials is a Brafs or Iron Rod, in Length equal to E D, which is like- 
wife equal to the Diftance of the Hour of 3 from the Hour of 6. This Style is fet upright 
in the Point D, and fhews the Hovr by the Shadow of it's Extremity. Thefe Dials, which 
may have likewife a Style in figure of a Parallelogram, as we have mentioned in fpeaking of 
Polar Dials, are fet upright againft Walls or Planes, perpendicular to the Horizon, and pa- 
rallel to the Meridian, one of which directly faces the Eaft, and the other the Weft, in fuch 
manner, that the Horizontal Line be perfectly level. 

The ConftruRion of Vertical Declining Dials. 

A Vertical Dial is one that is made upon a Vertical Plane, that is, a Plane perpendicular 
to the Horizon, as a very upright Wall. 

Among the nine Regular Dials of which we have fpoken, there are four of them Vertical 
ones, which do not decline at all, fince they directly face the four Cardinal Parts of the 
World. It now remains that we here fpeak of Irregular Dials, fome of which are vertical 
Decliners, others undeclining Decliners, and finally, others declining Incliners. Vertical 
Decliners are of four Kinds : for fome decline South-eaftwardly, the oppofite ones to thefe, 
North-weftwardly, others decline South-weftwardly, and the oppofite ones to thefe, North- 
eaftwardly. 

Now among the Irregular Dials, the vertical Decliners are moft in ufe, becaufe they are 
made upon or fet up againft Walls (which commonly are built upright), or elfe upon Bodies 
whofe Planes are upright ; but before thefe Dials can be made, the Declinations of the 
Walls or Planes, on which they are to be made or fet up againft, muft firft be known 
or found exactly : and this may be done by fome one of the Methods hereafter men- 
tioned. 
Fig. 9. Now fuppofe we know that a Plane (as that marked I of Figure 1.) or upright Wall, 

declines 45 Deg. South-weftwardly at Paris, or thereabouts, where the Pole is elevated 49 
Deg. above the Horizon. It is required to draw a Dial for this Declination. 

Firft, draw the Lines A B, CD, croffing each other at Right Angles in the Point E, the 
former of which fhall be the Hour-Line of 12, and the other the FIorizontal'Line. About 
the Point E, as a Center, draw the Arc F N of 45 Deg. becaufe the Plane's Declination is 
fuch, and fince it is South-weftwardly, the faid Arc muft be drawn on the Right-fide of 
the Meridian •, but if the Declination had been South-eaftwardly, that Arc muft have been 

drawn 



Chap, r . of Sun-Dials, %iy 

drawn on the Left-fide the Meridian. This being done, raife the Perpendicular FH from 
the Point F to the horizontal Line, that fo we may hate one Point of the Style therein, 
viz. the Foot of the Style. Then take the Diftance E F between your Compares, and lay 
it off upon the horizontal Line from E to O, and about the Point O, as a Center, defcribe 
the Arc E G equal to the Height of the Pole, viz. in this Cafe 49 Deg. and draw the dotted 
Line O A to the Hour-Line of 12 ; then A will be the Center of the Dial thro' which the 
Subftyle A H mud be drawn of an indeterminate Length. Note, This Subftyle is one of the 
principal Lines, by means Of which a Dial of this kind is drawn, and upon which the whole 
Exactnefs thereof almoft depends. 

Upon the Point H raife the right Line H I equal to H F, perpendicular to the Subftyle 
A H, and draw the right .Line A I, prolonged, for the Axis of the Dial. Then let fall the 
Perpendicular K I to the Axis, cutting the fubftylar Line in K, and make K L equal to 
% I, and draw a right Line both ways thro' the Point K, perpendicular to the Subftyle 
A K •, this will reprefent the Equinoctial Line, and cuts the Horizontal Line in a Point 
thro' which the Hour- Line of 6 muft pafs. Thus having already the Hour-Lines of 12 and 6, 
if the Operations hitherto performed have been done right, two dotted Lines L 6, and LN 
being drawn, will be at Right Angles to each other. Again, About the faid Point L, as a 
Center, defcribe the Quadrant of a Circle between the faid dotted Lines, whole Circumference 
divide into 6 equal Arcs, of 15 Degrees each, and draw occult Lines thro' the Points of 
Divifion to cut the Equinoctial Line ; but to have the Morning Hour-Lines, and thofe after 
6, prolong the Arc of the Quadrant both ways, and lay off as many Arcs of 15 Degrees 
upon it, as is neceffary, that fo occult Lines may be drawn from the Center L to cut the 
Equinoctial Line. Then if Lines are drawn from the Center A thro' all the Points wherein. 
the occult Lines cut the Equinoctial Line, thefe Lines thus drawn will be the Hour- Lines. 
Note, There muft be but 12 Hour-Lines drawn upon any vertical declining Plane, for the 
Sun will fhine on any one of them but 12 Hours. 

Points in the horizontal Line D C, thro' which the Hour-Lines muft pafs, may be found 
otherwife, by applying the Center of a horizontal Dial to the Point F, in fuch manner, that 
the Meridian Line thereof coincides with the Line F E, and it's Hour-Line of 6, with the 
Line F 6 : for then the Points where the Hour- Lines of the horizontal Dial cut the faid 
Line D C, will be the Points therein thro' which the Hour-Lines muft be drawn from the 
Center A. 

The Hour- Lines of fix Hours fuccefiively being given upon the Plane of any Dial what- 
foever, the other Hour-Lines may be drawn after the following Manner : Suppofe, in this 
Example, that the Hour-Lines from 6 to 12 are drawn j now if you have a mind to draw the 
Hour-Lines of 9, 10 and 11 in the Morning, which may be pricked down upon this Dial, 
draw a Parallel, as S V, from the Point V, taken at pleafure on the Hour-Line of 12, to 
the Hour-Line of 6, which fhall cut the Hour-Lines of 1, 2, and 3, in the Afternoon. 
This being done, the Diftance from V to the Hour- Line of 1 taken on this Parallel, and 
laid off on the other Side, will give a Point in the faid Parallel thro' which the Hour-Line 
of 11 muft be drawn -, likewife the Diftance V 2 will give a Point thereon, thro' which the 
Hour Line of 10 muft be drawn ; and the Diftance V 3 will give a Point thro' which the 
Hour-Line of 9 muft pafs. And fo if Lines are drawn from the Center of the Dial A thro* 
the faid Points, they will be the Hour-Lines. 

In this manner likewife may be found the Points thro' which the Hour-Lines of 7 and 8 in 
the Evening are drawn, in firft drawing a Parallel to the Hour-Line of 12, cutting the 
Hour-Line of 6 in one Point, and meeting the Hour-Lines of 4 and 5 produced •, for the 
Diftance from the Points where the Hour-Lines of 6 and 5 are cut by this Parallel, laid off 
on the other Side from the Point where the Hour-Line of 6 cuts the Parallel, will give a 
Point upon it thro' which the Hour-Line of 7 muft be drawn. And the Diftance from the 
Points where the Parallel cuts the Hour-Lines of 6 and 8, laid off on the other Side on that 
Parallel, will give a Point therein thro' which the Hour-Line of 8 muft pafs «, and if Lines 
are drawn from the Center A thro' thofe two Points found, they will be the Hour-Lines of 
7 and 8 in the Evening. This is a very good way of drawing thofe Hour-Lines that are 
pretty diftant from the fubftylar Line, becaufe thereby we avoid cutting the Equinoctial very 
obliquely. 

The Conftruction of a South-Eaft vertical Decliner is the fame as of that which we have 
defcribed, excepting only that what was there made on the Right muft here be on the Left, 
and the Figures for the Morning Hours fet to thofe for the Afternoon : fo that if a South- 
Weft declining Dial be drawn upon a Sheet of Paper, and afterwards the Paper be oiled, 
that you may fee thro' it, you will fee a South-Eaft Decliner thro' the Paper •, only the Fi- 
gures fet to the Hour-Lines muft be altered •, as, where the Figure of 1 ftands, you muft fet 
11 ; where the Figure of 2, 10 ; where the Figure of 3, 9 ; and fo on. By this means the 
iubftylar Line, which falls between the Hour-Lines of 3 and 4 Afternoon, in Figure 9, 
will fall in this Dial between 8 and 9 in the Morning. And if the Plane's Declination had 
been ltfs than 45 Deg. the Subftyle would have fallen yet nearer to the Meridian : but if, on 
the contrary, the Declination thereof had been greater, the Subftyle would have fallen 
more diftant from the Meridian, and pretty near the Hour-Line of 6. But when this 

Kkk happens, 



2i S ^fhe ConftruBian and Ufes Book VII L 

happens, the Hour-Lines fall fo clofe together near the Subftyle, that we are obliged to 
make the Model of a Dial upon a very large Plane, that fo the Hour-Lines may be very 
long, and the part of the Dial towards the Center taken away. 

After the abovenamed manner, likewife may be drawn North-Eaft and North- Weft Dials • 
but thefe have their Centers downwards underneath the Horizontal Line, and properly are 
no other but South-Eaft or South-Weft Decliners inverted, as may be feen in Figure 10, 
which reprefents a North-Weil Decliner of 45 Deg. drawn for the Plane L of Figure 1. 
and the fubftylar Line of this Dial mud be between the Hours of 8 and 9 in the Evening, 
whence one Decliner only may ferve for drawing four, if they have an equal Declination, tho' 
to different Coafts; two of which will have their Centers upwards, and the other two their 
Centers downwards. 

To draw the Subjlylar Line upon a Plane by means of the Shadow of the Extremity of an Iron- 

Rod, obferved twice the fame Day. 

Suppofe the Subftylar Line is to be found on the Decliner of Figure 9, firft place obliquely 
upon the Dial-Plane, a Wire or Iron Rod, fharp at the end, fo that the Extremity thereof 
be perpendicularly over the Point H in the Plane. This may be done by means of a 
Square. 
Fig q. Now fince this Figure is a South-Weft vertical Decliner, therefore the Subftylar Line 

thereon muft be found among the Afternoon Hours, to the Right-hand of the Meridian ; 
and confequently, let us fuppofe the Shadow of the Extremity of the Iron- Rod at the 
rirft Obfervation to fall on the Point P ; then about the Point H, the Foot of the Style, 
with the Diftance HP, defcribe the circular Arc PR. This being done, fome Hours after 
the firft Obfervation the fame Day, obferve when the Shadow of the Extremity of the Rod 
falls a fecond time upon the aforefaid Arc, which fuppofe in the Point Qj then if the Arc 
PQ^be bifected in the Point R, and a Right-line be drawn thro' the Points R and H ; this 
Line will be the Subftyle, which being exactly drawn, and the Height of the Pole above 
the Horizon of the Place where the Dial is made for, being otherwife known, it will not 
then be difficult to compleat the Dial ; for firft, the Meridian or Hour-Line of 12 is always 
perpendicular to the Horizon, in vertical Planes, and the Point wherein the Meridian and 
Subftylar Line produced meet each other, (as the Point A) will be the Center of the Dial. 
The Horizontal Line is a level Line palling thro' the Foot of the Style, as DHC. 

And to draw the Equinoctial Line, you muft firft form the Triangular Style AHI on 
the Subftyle, whofe Hypothenufe A I is the Axis, and Side FI I the right Style; then if 
I K be drawn from the Point I perpendicular to the Axis, meeting the Subftylar Line in 
the Point K; and if thro' K a Right Line MKN be drawn at Right Angles to the Stylar 
Line, this Line will be the Equinoctial, and the Point wherein it cuts the Horizontal Line 
will be always the Point thro' which the Hour-Line of 6 muft pafs. Moreover, the Diftance 
K L, laid off on the Stylar Line, will give the Point L the Center of the Equinoctial Circle. 
Now what remains to be done, may be compleated as before explained ; and even the whole 
Dial may be drawn in one's Room, after the Pofitions and Concourfes of the principal Lines 
are laid off upon a Sheet of Paper, and the Angle which the Subftylar Line makes with the 
Meridian or Horizontal Line be taken ; for one is the Complement of the other. 

Now to prove whether the Equinoctial Line be drawn right, make the Angle BAO equaj 
to the Complement of the Elevation of the Pole, viz. 41 Deg. for the Latitude of Paris, 
draw the Line AO to the Horizon, and make the Angle AON a Right one, that fo the 
Point N may be had in the Meridian or Hour-Line of 12, thro' which the Equinoctial Line 
muft pafs. Thus having feveral Ways for finding the principal Points, one of them will ferve 
to prove the other. 

When a Dial Plane declines South-eaftwardly, the Subftylar Line will be on the right Side 
of the Meridian. In which Cafe it is proper to take notice, that in finding the Subftylar 
Line, as above, to obferve when the Shadow of the Extremity of the Rod falls upon the 
Plane, as foon as the Sun begins to fhine thereon ; as likewife to mind the Time very 
exactly when the Shadow of the Extremity of the Style comes again to touch the circular Arc •, 
you may operate in this manner feveral Days fucceflively, in order to fee whether the Pofition 
of the Subftylar Line has been found exactly. 

When a Plane declines North-Eaft or North-Weft, the Shadows of the Extremity of the 
Iron Rod fall above the Foot of the Style, and fo the Center of the Dial muft be down- 
wards. Likewife the moft proper Time for making thefe Operations is about 15 Days be- 
fore or after the Solftices, for when the Sun is near the Equinoctial, his Declination is too 
fenfible, and the Operations lefs exact. Neverthelefs the Equinoctial Line may be drawn up- 
on a Plane, when the Sun is in the Equinoctial Points, and by that means a vertical declining 
Dial conftructed, by the following Method. 

To draw the EqninoEfial Line upon a vertical Plane by means of the Shadow of the Extremity of 

an Iron- Rod. 
The moft fimple and eafy Method to draw the Equinoctial Line upon a Wall or Plane, is 
at tke Time when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, (though this may be done at any other 

Time 



Chap. i. of Snn-T)ia!s. 219 

Time by more complicated Methods) for when the Sun defcribes the Equinoctial by his 
diurnal Motion, the Shadows of the Extremity of the Iron-Rod or Style, will all fall upon a 
Plane in a right Line, which is the common Section of the Equinoctial Circle, of the Heavens 
and the Plane. Therefore if feveral Points, pricked down upon a Plane, made by the Sha- 
dow of the Extremity of the Rod, on the Day the Sun is in the Equator, be joined, the 
ri^ht Line joining them will be the Equinoctial Line, as the Line M N, in Figure 9. This 
being done, draw the right Line A H L thro' the Foot of the Style at Right Angles to the 
Equinoctial Line, and this will be the'Subitylar Line: Moreover, draw the level Line D'HC 
thro' the Foot H of the Style ; this will be the Horizontal Line ; and if H I be drawn equal 
to the Height of the right Style, and parallel to the Equinoctial Line and the Points K and L 
joined ; and if A I be drawn at Right Angles to K I, then the Point A will be the Center 
of the Dial, and the upright Line AB the Meridian or Hour- Line of 12. The common 
Section of the Equinoctial and Horizontal Lines, will likewife be the Point thro' which the 
Hour-Line of 6 muft pafs, and confequently wherewith the Dial may be finifhed. Note, 
The Angle H F E will be the Plane's Declination. 

To draw a Dial upon a Vertical Plane by means of the Shadow of the Extremity of an Iron- 
Rod or Style obferved upon the Plane at Noon. 

A Style, as H I {Vide Figure 9.), being fet up on a Wall or Dial Plane, whofe Foot is H, 
and Extremity I ; and if you know by any means when it is Noon, which may be known 
by a Meridian Line drawn upon a Horizontal Plane, as we fhall mention hereafter, note 
where the Extremity of the Shadow of the Style H I falls upon the Plane at Noon, which 
fuppofe in the Point N, and thro' this Point draw the Perpendicular A N B, which confe- 
quently will be the Meridian of the Place or Hour-Line of 12 ; then draw the level Line 
CFI D, cutting the Meridian at Right Angles in the Point E ; this will be the Horizontal 
Line. Again,. Draw H F equal in Length to the right Style H I, and parallel to the Meri- 
dian ; then take the Hypothenufe E F between your Compaffes, and lay it off upon the Ho- 
rizontal Line from E to O, and make the Angle E O A equal to the Elevation of the Pole, 
viz. 49 Deg. and then the Point A will be the Center of the Dial. 

Likewife make the Angle EON, underneath the Horizontal Line, equal to the Comple- 
ment of the Elevation of the Pole, viz. 41 Deg. and the Point N on the Meridian Line will 
be that thro' which the Equinoctial Line mult pafs. Then if the right Line A H K be 
drawn thro' the Center A, and the Foot of the Style H, this will be the Subftylar Line ; and 
if a Perpendicular be drawn thro' the Point N to this Line, the faid Perpendicular will be the 
Equinoctial Line. Thus having found the principal Lines of the Dial, you may compleat 
it by the Methods before explained. 

This Method of drawing a Dial at any Time of the Year, by means of the Shadow of the 
Extremity of the Style H I obferved at Noon, may ferve, when it is not poffible to find the 
Subftylar Line by the Obfervations of the Shadows of the Extremity of an Ir,on-Rod or Style, 
which happens when Planes decline considerably Eaftwards or Weft wards. 

There are feveral other Methods of drawing Vertical Dials on Walls or Planes : but thofe 
would take up too much time to mention in this fmall Treatife, wherein we have only laid 
down the moft fimple and eafy Methods of drawing Vertical Dials. And in order to dr^w 
Dials more exactly, we fhall hereafter lay down Rules for calculating the Angles the 
Hour-Lines make at the Centers j and fo the other Methods may be verified by thefc 
Rules. 

The ConflruRion of Non-declining inclining Dials. 

The Inclinations of thefe Dials are the Angles that their Planes make with the Horizon, 
and fome of them face the Heavens, and others the Earth. There are likewife two Kinds 
of them with regard to the Pole ; and two other Kinds with regard to the Equi- 
noctial. 

If a Plane facing the South hath an Inclination towards the North, this Inclination may be Fig. 11, iz, 
lefs or greater than the Elevation of the Pole ; for if the Inclination be equal to the Elevation 
of the Pole, this Dial- Plane will be an upper or under Polar one, whofe Conftruction we 
have already laid down. 

If the Inclination be lefs than the Elevation of the Pole, which at Paris is nearly 49 Deg. 
and you would make a Dial upon a Plane facing the South, having 30 Deg. of Inclination 
towards the North, fubftract 30 Deg. from 49 Deg. and the Remainder 19 Deg. will be the 
Height of the Axis or Style above the Plane. Then if a Horizontal Dial be made upon this 
Plane for the Latitude of 19 Deg. in the manner we have already laid down, we fhall have 
an Incliner of 30 Deg. drawn, becaufe the faid Plane thus inclined is parallel to the Horizon 
of thofe Places where the Pole is elevated 19 Deg. and confequently this muft be a Horizon- 
tal Dial for thofe Places. The Center of this Dial is downwards, underneath the Equinoctial 
Line, and the Morning Hour-Lines on the Left, and the Afternoon ones on the Right-hand 
ot thofe looking at them. 

The under oppofite Dial to this, which faces towards the North, is the fame as the upper 
one facing towards the South, excepting only that the Center is upwards above the 

Equinoctial 



22o *rh e Conftruclion and Ufes Book VIII. 

Equinoctial Line, and the Morning Hour-Lines on the Right, and the Afternoon ones on 
the Left-hand. 

If the Inclination of the Plane be greater than the Elevation of the Pole, fuppofe at 
Paris, and it be 63 Deg. fubftract the Elevation of the Pole 49 Deg. from 63 Deg. and the 
Remainder will be 14 Deg. and then make an Horizontal Dial for this Elevation of 14 Deo-, 
and you will have an Incliner of 63 Deg. the Center of the upper Plane facing towards the 
South, is upwards above the Equinoctial Line, the Morning Hour-Lines on the Left-hand, 
thofe of the Afternoon towards the Right ; and in the oppofite under Plane facing towards 
the North, the Center is downwards, the Morning Hours on the Right, and thofe of the 
Afternoon on the Left, as may be feen in Figure 1 1 and 12. 

If the Plane faces the North, and inclines Southwards, the Inclination thereof may be lefs 
or greater than that of the Equinoctial ; for if it be equal, we need only make an upper or 
under Equinoctial Dial thereon, which is a Circle divided into 24 equal Parts, as is above di- 
rected in fpeaking of Regular Dials. 

If the Inclination be lefs than the Elevation of the Equinoctial, as, fuppofe a Plane at Paris 
inclines 30 Deg. Southwardly, add the 30 Deg. of Inclination to 49 Deg. the Height of the 
Pole, and make an Horizontal Dial for the Elevation of 79 Deg. and your Dial will be 
drawn : the Center of the upper Dial facing Northwardly, will be upwards, the Morning 
Hour-Lines on the Right-hand, the Afternoon ones on the Left •, and on the oppofite under 
Dial to this, the Center will be downwards, the Morning Hour-Lines on the Left, and the 
Afternoon ones on the Right-hand. 

Finally, If the Inclination, which fuppofe 60 Deg. be greater than the Height of the 
Equinoctial, add the Complement of the Inclination, which is 30 Deg. to the Elevation of 
the Equinoctial, which is 41 Deg. at Paris, and the Sum is 71 Deg. and make an Horizontal 
Dial for this Elevation of the Pole. The Center of the upper one of thefe Dials is down- 
wards, the Morning Hour-Lines on the Right-hand, and the Center of the oppofite under 
Dial is upwards, and the Morning Hour-Lines on the Left-hand. 

Note, The Meridian or Hour-Line of 12, is the Subftylar Line of all Non-declining in- 
clining Dials, paffes thro' their Centers at right Angles to the Hour-Lines of 6, and may be 
drawn by means of the Shadow of a Plumb-Line patting thro' their Centers. 

There ought to have been eight Figures to reprefent all thefe different Dials, viz. four for 
the upper ones, and four for the under ones ; but fince they are not difficult to be conceived 
or drawn, we have only reprefented two of them, with refpect to the Dodecahedron on which 
we place them. 

The Conjlruftion of Declining inclining Dials. 

The Declination of a Dial is the Angle that the Plane thereof makes with the Prime Ver- 
tical ; and it's Inclination is the Angle made by the Plane thereof witn the Horizon : both of 
which we mall fhew how to find hereafter. 

Now fuppofe, for Example, that a Dial is to be drawn upon a Plane declining 36 Deg. 
South-eaftwardly, and inclining 63 Deg. 26 Min. towards the Earth, as does the Plane C on 
the Dodecahedron of Figure 2. 

But before we fhew how to draw this Dial, you muft firft obferve that the Horizontal 
Line, which paries thro' the Foot of the Style in Vertical Dials, muft in no wife pals thro' it 
in inclining Dials ; for in upper Incliners facing the Heavens, this Line muff be drawn 
above the Foot of the Style, and in under Incliners, facing the Earth, below the Foot of the 
Style. Secondly, The Meridian or Hour-Line of 12, in inclining Dials, does not cut the 
Horizontal Line at right Angles, as it does in Vertical Dials, but muft be drawn thro' two 
Points ; one of which is found upon the Horizontal Line by means of the Angle of De- 
clination, and the other upon a Vertical Line cutting the Horizontal one at right 
Angles. 

This laft Point in upper Incliners is called the Zenith Point, becaufe if the Sun was in 
the Zenith of the Place for which the Dial is made, the Extremity of the Shadow of the 
Style would fall upon that Point, which confequently will be underneath the Style of thefe 
Dials. And in under Incliners, the faid Point is called the Nadir Point, becaufe if the Sun 
was in the Nadir, and the Earth tranfparent, the Extremity of the Shadow of the Style 
would touch that Point, which confequently will be above the Style, as in the propofed 
Dial. 

Thirdly, The Center of the propofed under Dial which declines South-eaftwardly muft be 
upwards, the Subftylar Line to the Left-hand of the Vertical Line, and the Meridian among 
the Morning Hour-Lines, and fo on the Right of the Vertical Line. The Centers of upper 
Dials declining South-weftwardly muft be likewife upwards, the Subftylar Line on the Right- 
hand of the Vertical one, and the Meridian among the Afternoon Hour-Lines ; and the op- 
pofite upper Dials to thefe, have their Centers downwards, and are no other but thefe Dials 
inverted : and therefore one of thefe four Dials is enough to be drawn. 
F 'g- «3- In order for this, let it be required to draw a Dial upon a Plane of the abovefaid Decli- 

nation and Inclination. Firft, Draw the two Lines Ajf, CD, cutting each other at right 
Angles in the Point E -, then let C D be parallel to the Horizon, and upon it aflume E F 

at 



Chap. i. of Sun-Dials. 221 

at pleafure, for the Length of the right Style, whofe Foot fhaH be E, and Extremity F, and 
about the Center F defcnbe the Arc G H, equal to the Plane's Inclination, viz. 6% Deg. 26 
Min. and draw the right LineAF; likewifc make the Angle G FI equal to the Comple- 
ment of 63 Deg. 26 Min. viz. 26 Deg. 34 Min. This being done, the Point A will be the 
Nadir, and one Point of the Meridian Line, and if a right Line M L N be drawn thro' the 
Point L, parallel to CD, this will be the horizontal Line ; and if the Diftance LF be 
taken between your Cotnpaffes, and laid off from L to O, the Point O will be the Center 
tfiro' which Lines may be drawn dividing the horizontal Line. Again, About the Point O 
defcribe the Arc L P of 36 Deg. viz. the Plane's Declination, and draw the Line O P cut- 
ting the horizontal Line MLN in the Point 12 ; then if a right Line be drawn thro' the 
Nadir A and this Point 12, the faid Line A 12 will be the Meridian of the Dial or Hour- 
Line of 12 : and moreover, if an Angle be made at the Point O on the Left-fide of the 
Line AB, equal to the Complement of the Plane's Declination, which here is 54 Deg. you 
will have a Point on the horizontal Line thro' which the Hour-Line of 6, as likewife the 
Equinoctial Line, muft pafs. 

The next thing to be found is another Point, befides E the Foot of the Style, thro' which 
the fubftylar Line muft pafs ; and in order for this, we need only find the Center of the Dial, 
after the following manner. 

Draw the Line M R from the Point M, (thro' which the Hour- Line of 6 paffes) at right 
Angles to the Meridian A 12, lay off the Diftance O 12, from 12 to R, or elfe the Diftance 
AF from A to R, draw the occult Line 12 R, and about the Point R defcribe the Arc 
NK, of 49 Deg. viz. the Elevation of the Pole; then if RK be drawn cutting the Me- 
ridian in the Point K, this will be the Center of the Dial. After this, the Subftylar Line 
K E may be drawn ; and if the Perpendicular M QJ)e drawn to this Line thro' the Point 
M, the faid MQ^will be the Equinoctial Line. Moreover, the Point in the Meridian Line 
thro' which the Equinoctial Line muft pafs, may be found by making the Angle N R Q^ of 
41 Deg. that is, the Complement of the Elevation of the Pole. 

ThePofitions of the principal Lines being thus found, it will not now be difficult to find 
the Points on the horizontal or equinoctial Lines, thro' which the Hour-Lines muft be drawn ; 
for if the Points are to be found upon the horizontal Line you muft apply the Center of a 
horizontal Dial to the Point O, in fuch manner, that the Hour-Line of 12 anfwers to the 
Line O 12, and the Hour-Line of 6 to the Line O 6 : then the Points in the horizontal 
Line M N, thro' which the other Hour-Lines muft be drawn, may be determined eafily. 
And if the Points thro' which the Hour-Lines muft pafs on the equinoctial Line be to be 
found, you muft raife the Perpendicular E S on the Subftyle equal to E F, and draw the 
Axis S K ; and afterwards take the Diftance T S between your Compaffes, and lay off on 
the Subftyle from T to V, then V will be the Center of the Equinoctial Circle, by means 
of which the Equinoctial Line may be divided, as we have directed in fpeaking of declining 
Dials, and the Hour-Lines drawn thro' the Center of the Dial K. Your Dial being thus 
made, you may draw a fair Draught thereof, wherein are only the principal Lines, and the 
Hour-Lines, as may be feen in the Pentagonal Figure marked 14. 

By means of this Dial three others of the fame Declination and Inclination may be made. 
The two under ones declinining South-eaftwardly and South-weftwardly, have their Centers 
upwards •, and the two upper ones, which decline North-eaftwardly and North-weftwardly, 
their Centers downwards, and are only the two former Dials inverted, as we have al- 
ready mentioned. 

The Dial of the Figure 15, reprefents that marked F in Figure 2, and is an upper Incliner 
of 63 Deg. 26 Min. declining South-eaftwardly 72 Deg. and may be drawn by the abovefaid 
Method. The Center of this Dial is upwards, and becaufe it has a great Declination, the 
Hour-Lines will fall very clofe to one another near the Subftylar Line; and therefore it 
ought to be drawn upon a large Plane, that fo the Part thereof next to the Center may be 
taken away, and the Style and the Hour-Lines terminated by two Parallels. 

There is another way of drawing Mechanically any forts of Dials whatfoever, upon Po- 
lyhedrons or Bodies of different Faces or Superficies, without even knowing the Declina- 
tions or Inclinations of the Faces or Superficies, and that with as much exactnefs as by any 
other Methods whatfoever. In order to do this, you muft firft make an horizontal Dial up- 
on one of the Planes or Faces that is to be fet parallel to the Horizon, and fet up the Style 
thereof upon the Hour-Line of 12, conformable to the Latitude of the Place. After this, 
the Subftylar Lines muft be drawn upon all the Planes or Faces of the Polyhedron that the 
Sun can fhine upon, that fo Brafs or Iron Styles, proportioned to the bigneffes of the Planes, 
or Faces, may be fixed upon them perpendicularly in fuch manner, that the Axes or upper 
Edges of the faid Styles be parallel to the Axis of the horizontal Dial. This may be done 
in filing them away in right Lines by Degrees, until their Axes, being compared with the 
Axis of a large Style fimilar to that of the horizontal Dial placed level, (or held up fo that 
its Bafe be parallel to the Horizon, by means of a Thread and Plummet hung to the Top of 
the Style) appear in a right Line with the Axis of the faid Style. 

Things being thus ordered, fet your Polyhedroh in the Sun, and turn it about, making 
the Shadow of the Axis of the horizontal Dial fall upon each Hour-Line thereof fucceffively, 

L 1 1 and 



222 ^ e ConftruSiion and Ufes Book VIIL 

and if at each of the refpective Times right Lines be drawn along the Shadows of the Axes 
of the Styles of the other Faces of the Body upon the faid Faces, thefe will be the fame 
Hour-Lines upon each of the Faces of the Body, that the Shadow of the Style of the Hori- 
zontal Dial fell upon, on the Horizontal Dial. For example ; Suppcfe the Shadow of the 
Axis of the Horizontal Dial falls upon the Hour Line of 12 ; then at the fame time draw 
Lines along the Shadows of the Styles upon the other Faces of the Body, and thofe Lines 
will be the Hour-Lines of 12 upon the faid Faces: underftand the fame for others. 
This may be done likewife in the Night, by the Light of a Link moved about the 
Polyhedron. 

There are great Stone Bodies cut into feveral Faces placed fometimes in Gardens hav- 
ing Dials drawn upon them, according to the aboveiaid Method, And the Edges of the 
Stone which ferve for Axes to fome of thefe Dials, muft be cut fo as to be parallel to the 
Axis of the World. 

'The Arithmetical ConfiruUion of Dials by the Calculation of Angles. 

This Method is a great help for verifying any Operations in Dialling, wherein there is 
crreat Exactnefs required, and chiefly when we are obliged to make a fmall Model for drawino- 
a large Dial : for an Error almoft infenfible in the Model, will become very confiderable in 
the long Hour- Lines to be drawn upon a large Plane. 

In the Conftruction of Regular Di^ls, as of the Horizontal one of Figure 4, the Divifions 
of the Equinoctial Line LK, are the Tangents of the Angles of the Quadrant MH, and 
the dotted Lines are their Secants •, and therefore they may be pricked down by means of 
a Scale or Sector, in fuppofing the Radius HB 100 : for then the Tangent H 1 of 15 Deg. 
will be twenty-feven of the faid Parts ; H 2, the Tangent of 30 Deg. will be 58 •, H 3, the 
Tangent of 45 Deg. (equal to Radius) will be 100 ; H 4, the Tangent of 60 Deg. will be 
173 •, and H 5, the Tangent of 75 Deg. will be 373 Parts. The Divifions on the other half 
of this Line for the Morning Hour-Lines are the fame. 

The Divifions for the halves and quarters of Flours may be found likewife upon the 
Equinoctial Line, by affuming the Tangents of the correfpondent Arcs, which may be 
taken from printed Tables of natural Tangents, but from the Table of Secants we can 
deduce fome Abreviations. For example, the Line B 4, which is the Secant of 60 Deg. 
being double to Radius, if twice B H be laid off from B 4, you will have the Point on 
the Equinoctial Line thro' which the Hour-Line of 4 muft be drawn. The faid Secant laid 
off from 4 to L, will give likewife the Point in the Equinoctial Line thro' which the Hour- 
Line of 5 muft be drawn, &amp;V. 

The Points thro' which the half Hours muft pafs, may be found by means of the Secants 
of the odd Hours. For example, the Secant B 3, laid off at the Point 3 on the Equinoctial 
Line, will fall on one fide upon the Point for half an Hour paft 4, and on the other fide, 
for half an Hour paft 10; the Secant B 9, will give half an Hour paft 7, and half an 
Hour paft 1 ; B 11, will give half an Hour paft 8, and half an Hour paft 2; Bi, will 
give half an Hour paft 3, and half an Hour paft 9 •, B 7, will give half an Hour paft 
6, and half an Flour paft 12 ; and laftly, B 5 will give half an Hour paft n, and half an 
Hour paft 5. 

The Divifion of the Equinoctial Line ferves to make the Horizontal and Vertical Dials 
exactly, but chiefly the undeclining Regular Dials, viz. the Polar Eaft and Weft ones : 
for there need nothing be added to the facility of conftructing Equinoctial Dials, becaufe 
the Angles that the Hour-Lines make at the Center of the Dials are all equal between 
themfelves. 

The Angles that the Hour-Lines of a horizontal Dial make with the Meridian in the 
Center of the Dial, may be found in the following manner by Trigonometry. As Radius 
is to the Sine of the Elevation of the Pole, So is the Tangent of the Diftance of any Hour- 
Circle from the Meridian, to the Tangent of the Angle that the Hour- Line of that Hour 
makes with the Meridian or Hour-Line of 12, on the Horizontal Dial. For example ; Sup- 
pole the Angle that the Hour-Lines of I and 11, make with the Meridian on a horizontal 
Dial for the Latitude of 49 Deg. be required : form a Rule of Proportion whofe firftTerm 
let be the Radius 100000; the fecond, the Sine of 49 Deg. which is 75471 ; and the third, 
the Tangent of 15 Deg. (viz. the Tangent of the Diftance of the Hour-Circles of 11 and 
1 from the Meridian) which is 26597. Now having found the fourth Term 20222, feek it 
in the Tables of Tangents, and you will find 11 Deg. 26 Min. ftand againft it: therefore the 
Angle that the Hour-Lines of 1 or 11 make with the Meridian, is 11 Deg. 26 Min. 

Thus may be found the Angles that all the Flour-Lines, and half Hour-Lines, &amp;V. make; 
with the Meridian in the Center of a horizontal Dial, viz. by as many Rules of Proportion, 
as there are Hour-Lines and half Hour-Lines, &amp;c. to be drawn, whofe two firft Terms are 
ftanding, to wit, the Radius, and the Sine of the Elevation of the Pole ; and fo you have 
but the third Term to feek in the Tables -, that is, the Tangent of the Hour-Circle's diftance 
from the Meridian, in order to find the 4th Term. You may take the Logarithms of thofe 
Terms if you have a mind to it&gt; which will fave the trouble of multiplying and dividing.

The aforefaid Analogy may ferve likewife for vertical Dials, if the Sine Complement of 
the Elevation of the Pole, which is 41 Deg. about Paris, be made ufe of for the fecond 
Term •, becaufe any vertical Dial at Paris may be confidered as an Horizontal one for the 
Latitude of 41 Deg. 

Moreover, the aforefaid Analogy holds for undeclining Inclining-Dials, if the Sine of the 
Angle made by the Axis and Meridian -Line at the Center of the Dial be ufed for the fecond 
Term of the Analogy. For Example, Becaufe the Dial B on the Dodecahedron of Figure 2, 
inclines 63 Deg. 26 Min. you mud fubftradt the Elevation of the Pole, which is 49 Deg. from 
63 Deg. 26 Min. and then if you make an horizontal Dial for the Latitude of 14 Deg. 26 
Mm. in taking 14 Deg. 26 Min. for the fecond Term of the Analogy, you may calculate the 
Angles that all the Hour-Lines make with the Meridian or Hour-Line of 12.

To draw the principal Lines upon a 'vertical Decliner by Trigonometrical Calculation. 
This manner of Calculation confifts in the five following Rules. 

The Declination of a Plane being given, to find the Angle that the fubftylar Line makes 
with the Meridian. 

Rule I. As Radius is to the Sine of the Plane's Declination, So is the Tangent Comple- 
ment of the Latitude, to the Tangent of the Angle made by the fubftylar Line and Meridian 
in the Center of a vertical Decliner. And the Angle that the fubftylar Line makes with the 
Horizon at the Foot of the right Style, is the Complement of this Angle. Alfo the Angle 
that the Equinoctial Line makes with the Horizon at the Point wherein the Hour-Line of 6 
cuts it, is equal to the Angle made by the fubftylar Line and Meridian j and the Angle of 
the Equinoctial Line and Meridian is it's Complement. 

Rule II. To find the Angle which the Axis of the Dial makes with the fubftylar Line, 
which may be called likewife the Height of the Pole above the vertical Plane ; fay, 

As Radius is to the Sine Complement of the Latitude, So is the Sine Complement of the 
Plane's Declination to the Sine of the Angle required. Note, The Angle that the Axis 
makes with the right Style, is the Complement of this Angle ; and the Angle that the Radius 
of the Equinoctial Circle makes with the right -Style, is equal to the Angle that the Axis 
makes with the Subftyle. Alfo the Angle made by the Radius of the Equinoctial Circle and 
the Subftyle, is the Complement thereof. 

Rule III. To find the Arc of the Equinoctial or Angle between the fubftylar Line and 
the Meridian in declining Dials ; that is, the Difference between the Meridian of the Place, 
and the Meridian of the Plane, for the fubftylar Line is the Meridian of the Plane ; 
fay, 

As Radius is to the Sine of the Latitude, So is the Tangent Complement of the Plane's 
Declination to the Tangent of an Arc, whofe Complement will be that required. 

Rule IV. To find the Angle that the Hour-Line of 6 makes with the horizontal Line, 
and the Meridian in the Center of the Dial ; fay, 

As Radius is to the Sine of the Plane's Declination, So is the Tangent of the Latitude, 
to the Tangent of the Angle that the Hour- Line of 6 makes with the Horizon j the Com- 
plement of which, is that made by the Hour-Line of 6 and the Meridian. 

Rule V. To find the Angles that the Hour-Lines make with the fubftylar Line ; and by 
this means, the Angles that they make with the Meridian in the Center of a vertical 
Dial. 

This Propofition is founded upon this Gnomonick Principle, viz. that any Plane may be 
parallel to fome Horizon, and confequently will be" an horizontal Dial for that Latitude, the 
fubftylar Line being the Meridian, from which the proper Hour-Lines muft be laid off on 
both Sides. 

But before this can be done, the Angle that the Subftyle makes with the Meridian 
muft be found, hy Rule I. the Elevation of the Pole above the Plane, by Rule IT. the Arc 
of the Equinoctial between the Subftyle and the Meridian, by Rule III. with the Difference 
or Degrees of the two firft Diftances from the Style ; one being between the Subftyle and 
the Meridian, and the other between the Subftyle and the Hour-Line of 6. Thefe being 
found, fay, 

As Radius is to the Sine of the Elevation of the Pole above the Plane, So is the Tangent of 
the Diftance of any Hour-Circle from the Meridian of the Plane or' Subftylar Line to the 
Tangent of the Angle made by the Hour-Line of the propofed Hour-Circle and the fub- 
ftylar Line in the Center of the Dial. 

£?ote, 



22A ^ e ConflruSiion and Ufes Book VIII. 

Not^ If the fubftylar Line happens to fall upon any half or whole Hour, then the two 
firft Diftances of the Hour-Circles from the fubftylar Line will be each 7 Deg. 30 Min. or 

15 Deg. and in this Cafe, the Angles of the Hour-Lines of the Hour-Circles, equally diftant 
on both fides the Hour the fubftylar Line falls upon, will be equal on both fides the fubftylar 
Line. 

The Application of the precedent Rules to a vertical Decliner of 45 Deg. South-weflwardly-y 
in the Latitude of 49 Beg. (Vide Figure 9.) 

The Angle made by the fubftylar Line and the Meridian, will be found by the firft Rule 

31 Deg. 25 Min * 

The Angle of the Axis and fubftylar Line, by Rule IL will be 27 Deg. 38 Min. and the 
Arc of the Equinoctial between the Meridian of the Place and the Meridian of the Plane, by 
Rule 111. will be found 52 Deg. 58 Min. and confequently the fubftylar Line falls between the 
Hour- Lines of 3 and 4 in the Afternoon ; and the Angle made by the Hour-Line of 6 and 
the Meridian, is 50 Deg. 52 Min. 

The Arc of the Equinoctial 52 Deg. 58 Min. being found, fubftract 45 Deg. which is the 
Arc of the Equinoctial anfwering to the Hour of 3, from it, and the Remainder 7 Deg. 
58 Min. will be the Arc of the Diftance of the Hour of 3 from the Subftyle, and confequent- 
ly 7 Deg. 2 Min. is the Diftance of the Hour of 4 from the Subftyle. 

Therefore to find the Angles that the Hour-Lines make with the Subftyle in the Center of 
the Dial, you mult begin with one of thefe Diftances, in faying, for Example, As Radius 
1 00000 is to the Sine of the Elevation of the Pole above the declining Plane, which in this 
Example is 27 Deg. 38 Min. whofe Sine is 46381, So is the Tangent of 7 Deg. 2 Min. which 
is 12337, to a fourth Number, which fhall be found 5722, viz. the Tangent of 3 Deg. 16 
Min. and confequently the Angle that the Hour-Line or 4 makes with the Subftyle, is 3 Deg. 

16 Min. and to find the Angle that the Hour-Line of 5 makes with the fubftylar Line, you 
muft firft add 15 Deg. to 7 Deg. 2 Min. and feek the Tangent of the Sum 22 Deg. 2 Min. and 
then proceed, as before, and you will find the Angle made by the Hour-Line of 5 with the 
fubftylar Line will be 10 Deg. 38 Min. the Angle of the Hour-Line of 6 with the fame, will 
be 19 Deg. 17 Min. the Angle of the Hour-Line of 7, 30 Deg. 44 Min. and the Angle of the 
Hour-Line of 8 in the Evening, 47 Deg. 25 Min. 

But if the Angles that the faid Hour-Lines make with the Meridian or Hour-Line of 12 be 
required, you muft add 31 Deg. 35 Min. to each of the aforefaid Angles ; and confequently 
the Angle that the Hour-Line of 4 makes with the Meridian, will be 34 Deg. 51 Min. the 
Hour-Line of 5, 42 Deg. 13 Min. the LIour-Line of 6, 50 Deg. 52 Min. the Hour-Line 
of 7, 61 Deg. 19 Min. and the Hour-Line of 8, 79 Deg. 10 Min. 

Having calculated, in the abovefaid manner, the Angles made by the Hour- Lines on the 
other fide the fubftylar Line, with the faid fubftylar Line, you will find the Angle of the 
Hour-Line of 3, 3 Deg. 45 Min. that of the Hour- Line of 2, 11 Deg. 7 Min. that of the 
Hour-Line of 1 , 19 Deg. 54 Min. that of the Hour-Line of 1 2, 31 Deg. 25 Min. that of the 
Hour- Line of 11, 48 Deg. 54 Min. that of the Hour-Line of io, 75 Deg. 7 Min. and that 
of the Hour-Line of 9, 106 Deg. 48 Min. 

Now if 31 Deg. ^S Min. viz. the Subftyle's Diftance from the Meridian, be taken from 
each of thefe laft Angles, then the Angle that the Hour-Line of 9 makes with the Meridian, 
will be 75 Deg. 13 Min. that of the Hour-Line of 10, 43 Deg. 2 1 Min. that of the Hour- 
Line of 1 1, 17 Deg. 19 Min. and fo of others. 

When the Declination of a Plane is very great, the Center of a Dial cannot then be 
pricked down conveniently thereon, fince the Hour-Lines will fall too near each other. And 
in this Cafe they may be drawn between two horizontal Lines ; for the Angles that the 
Hour-Lines make with the faid horizontal Lines, are the Complements of the Angles that 
the refpective Hour-Lines make with the Meridian. 

How to find the Declination of an upright or vertical Wall or Plane, by means of the Shadow 

of the Extremity of an Iron Rod or Style. 

Becaufe the Exactnefs of Vertical Dials chiefly depend on the Knowledge of the Situa- 
tions of the Walls on which they are to be made or i'et up againft, with refpct to the Hea- 
vens, that is, their Declinations : therefore it is very neceflary that their Declinations 
be found with all poflible Exactnefs, which we fhall endeavour to do before we clofe this 
Chapter. 

Preparations. 

You muft firft fix an Iron Rod or Wire in the Wall obliquely, having it's Extremity (harp 
and pretty diftant from the Wall, as the Rod A I, whofe Extremity I is fharp. Vide Fig. 9. 

Secondly, The Foot H of the Style muft be pricked down upon the Dial Plane. This 
Point is that wherein the Perpendicular FI I drawn from the Extremity of the Rod or Style 
meets the Plane of the Dial. You muft likewife draw the vertical Line H F pafling th.ro' 
that Point, which reprefents the perpendicular Vertical to the Plane of the Dial, and alfo 
the horizontal Line DC cutting the faid vertical Line at right Angles, in the Foot of the 

Styla 



Chap. r. of Sun-Dials. 225 

Style H. This being done, meafure eXaclly the Length of the right Style HI orHF, its 
equal, that is, meafure the Diftance from the Foot of the Style to its Extremity, with fome 
Scale divided into fmall Parts. Then having obferved where the Extremity Of the Shadow 
of the Iron Rod falls upon the Wall at different Times in the fame Day, as at the Points 
2, 3, 4 ■■&gt; you muff meafure the Diftance of eacli Extremity of the Shadow from the hori- 
zontal Line with the Scale: as, for example, the Diftance from the Point 2 to the Point Z 
in the horizontal Line •, as likewife the Diftance from the fame Point to the Vertical Line 
paffing thro' the Foot of the Style ; as from the Point 2 to the Point X ; and then you 
muft let down the Numbers found orderly in a Memorial, that fo they may be made ufe of 
in the following Analogies. 

But to prick down upon the Wall nicely the Shadow of the Extremity of the Rod or 
Style, you muft ufe the following Method, which I had from M. de la Hire. Fatten a little 
Tin-Plate, having a round hole therein, near the Extremity of the Rod, in fuch manner, 
that the Extremity of the Iron Rod be exactly in the Center of the faicl round hole, and the 
Plate expofed directly to the Sun ; then you will fee a little Oval of Light upon the Wall in 
the Shadow of the Plate: and if you draw quickly with a Pencil, a light Track upon the' 
Wall about the laid Oval of Light, which is moving continually ; the Center of the faid Oval 
may be taken lor the true Shadow of the Extremity of the Rod. 

Having thus marked the Points 2, 3, 4, whereat the Extremity of the Shadow falls, you 
muft find the Amplitude, and the Sun's Altitude anfwering to each of them, and fet them 
down in the Memorial. 

Note, The Amplitude that we mean here, is the Angle that the height of the Style or 
Rod makes with the Line drawn from each of the obferved Extremities of the Shadow to 
the horizontal Line (for each of thefe Lines reprefents upon the Wall the vertical Circle 
the Sun is in at the Time of Obfervation). This Angle is marked H F Z in the Figure, 
and is the Amplitude correfpondent to the Point 2. Now to find this Angle, you 
muft fay, As the Height of the Rod or Style is to the Diftance from the Extremity of the 
Shadow to the vertical Line, So is Radius to the Tangent of the Amplitude* And by 
making this Analogy for each Extremity of the Shadow of the Rod obferved at different 
Times, the correfpondent Amplitudes will be had, and muft be fet down in one Column in 
the Memorial. 

Then to find the Sun's Altitude above the Horizon, you muft take the Complement of 
the Amplitude, and the Diftance of each obferved Extremity of the Shadow from the hori- 
zontal Line. This being done, fay, As the Height of the Style is to the Sine Complement 
of the Amplitude, So is the Diftance of the Extremity of the Shadow from the horizontal 
Line, to the Tangent of the Sun's Altitude above the Horizon, which being found for the 
Times of each Obfervation of the Shadow of the Iron Rod, fet them down orderly in one 
Column. 

Note, If the Extremity of the Shadow obferved falls upon the vertical Line paffing thro* 
the Foot of the Style, there will then be no Amplitude ; and in this Cafe you will have the 
Sun's Altitude by one. Rule only, in faying, As the Height of the Style is to the Diftance of 
the Extremity of the Shadow from the Foot of the Style, So is Radius to the Tangent of the 
Sun's Altitude. 

After this, you muft find the Diftance of each obferved vertical or azimuth Line from 
the Meridian ; and in order to do this, the Sun's Declination muft be had for the Times 
wherein the Extremities of the Shadow were taken : if it be at the time of the Solftices, the 
lame Declination will ferve for all the Extremities of the Shadow obferved in one Day ; but 
it the Sun be in the Equinoctial, you muft have his Declination for each time of the Obfer- 
vation of the Extremity of the Shadow, in taking the Parts proportional. 

Now the Sun's Declination being had, you muft take the Complement thereof, as like- 
wife the Complement of his Altitude, and the Complement of the Latitude, and add them 
all three together ; and take half the Sum, and from this half Sum take the Complement of 
the Sun's Altitude, and the Remainder will be a firft Difference : and moreover, if the Com- 
plement of the Latitude be taken from the faid half Sum, you will have a fecond Dif- 
ference. This being done, fay, As the Sine Complement of the Latitude is to the Sine of 
the firft Difference, fo is the Sine of the fecond Difference to a fourth Sine : and as the Sine 
Complement of the Sun's Altitude is to Radius, fo is that fourth Sine found to another 
Sine; which being multiplied by Radius, and the Square Root of the Product, will be half 
the Diftance of the Extremity of the Shadow obferved, or of its vertical Line from the Me- 
ridian or Hour-Line of 12. 

This Diftance being found in Degrees and Minutes, we may have the Declination of any 
Wall, which here is the Angle H F E, by fome one of the five following Cafes. 

Firft, If the Extremity of the Shadow of the Style is between the vertical Line pafilng 
thro* the Foot of the Style, and the Hour- Line of 12, as is the Point 2 in this Example, 
which was obferved fome time in the Afternoon •, then you muft add the Amplitude to the 
Diftance of the vertical Line from the Meridian. 

M m m Secondly, 



22,6 *The Conjlruciion and Ufes Book VI I L 

Secondly* If the Extremity of the Shadow falls beyond the vertical Line parting thro' the 
Foot of the Style, as here the Point 3 does, you muft fubftract the Amplitude from the Di- 
stance of the vertical Line from the Meridian, to have the Declination of the Wall. 

Thirdly, If the obferved Extremity of the Shadow be found exactly upon the vertical Line 
patting thro' the Foot of the Style, then there will be no Amplitude, and its Diftance from 
the Meridian will be the Wall's Declination. 

Fourthly, If the Extremity of the Shadow is on this fide of the Meridian, as here the 
Point 4 is, which was obferved before Noon, the Amplitude will be greater than the Decli- 
nation •, to have which, you muft fubftraet from the Amplitude the Diftance of the Vertical 
Line from the Meridian. 

Fifthly, If the Extremity of the Shadow was obferved precifely at Noon, the Wall's 
Declination would be equal to the Amplitude •, and fince the Snn's Declination, and 
the Latitude is known, it will be eafy to know whether the Altitude obferved any Day be 
the greateft for that Day, that is, whether it be the Sun's Meridian Altitude. Note, What 
we have faid is eafily applicable to all Declinations, whether Eaft wards or Weft wards, if 
the Line of Midnight be ufed inftead of that of Noon, when Walls decline North-Eaft or 
North-Weft. 

An Example will make all this manifeft : in order to which, let us fuppofe, that, in a 
Place where the North-Pole is elevated, or, which is all one, where the Latitude of the 
Place is 48 Deg. 50 Min. we have obferved the Extremity of the Shadow of an Iron-Rod 
Upon a very upright Wall about the time of the Summer Solftice, whofe Diftance from the 
vertical Line paffing thro' the Foot of the Style is 100 equal Parts of fome Scale, and the 
Height of the Style 300 of the fame Parts.

each Obfrrvation, and the proportional Parts of the Differences arifing may be taken : if, 
for Example, the Extremity of the Shadow of the Style hath been fix times obferved, you 
muft take the one-fixth Part of the Differences produced by the Calculations, in order to have

CHAP. IL 

Of the ConfiruBiion and Ufes of the Declinatory^ 

THIS Inftrument is made of a very even Plate of Brafs or dry Wood, in figure of a Fig. 16, 
Rectangle, about one Foot in Length, and feven or eight Inches in Breadth. We draw 
the Diameter of a Semi-Circle upon it parallel to one of the longeft Sides of this Plate, viz. 
parallel to A B, and we divide this Semi-Circle into two Quadrants* containing 90 Degrees 
each, which we divide fometimes into half Degrees, the Degrees being both ways numbered 
from the Point H, as may be feen in the Figure of the Inftrument. When this is done, we 
add an Index I to the faid Plate, which turns about the Center G, by means of a turned 
headed Rivet. On the fiducial Line of this Index we fcrew a Compafs, with the North-Side 
towards the Center G, and likewife fometimes a fmall horizontal Dial, whofe Hour-Line of 
12 turns to the Center G. I fhall fay no more as to the Conftruction of this Inftrument, it 
being eafy to underftand, from what has been faid elfewhere in this Treatife. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument in taking the Declinations of Planes. 

A Plane is faid to decline, when it does not face directly one of the Cardinal Parts of 
the World, which are North, South, Eaft, and Weft •, and the Declination thereof is mea- 
fured by an Arc of the Horizon comprehended between the Prime Vertical, and the vertical 
Circle parallel to the faid Plane, if it be vertical, viz. perpendicular to the Horizon ; for if 
a Plane be inclined, it can be parallel to no vertical Circle. And in this Cafe, the Arc of the 
Horizon comprehended between the Prime Vertical, and that vertical Circle that is parallel 
to the Bafe of the inclined Plane, or elfe the Arc of the Horizon computed between the 
Meridian of the Place, and the vertical Circle perpendicular to the Plane, is the Plane's 
Declination. 

There are no Planes, unlefs vertical or inclined ones, that can decline ; for a horizontal 
Plane cannot be faid to decline, becaufe the upper Surface thereof directly faces the Zenith, 
and it's Plane turns towards all the four Cardinal Parts of the World indifferently. 

Now, in order to find the Declination of a Plane, whether vertical or inclined, you muft 
draw firft a level Line thereon, that is, a Line parallel to the Horizon, and lay the Side A B 
of the Inftrument along this Line : then you muft turn the Index and Compafs 'till the Needle 
fixes itfelf directly over the Line of the Declinatior or Variation thereof on the Bottom of 
the Box. This being done, the Degrees of the Semi Circle cur by the fiducial Line of the 

Index 



2,28 ^ )e Conflruciion anfl Ufes Book VIII 

Index gives the Plane's Declination towards that Coaft fhewn by the writing graved upon 
the Inftrument. If, for example, the Index be found fixed upon the 45th Degree, between 
II and Bj and the end of the Needle reflecting the North be directly over the Point S of 
its Line of Declination ; in this Cafe, the Plane declines 45 Deg. South- weft ward I y : but if 
in the fame Situation of the Declinatory, the oppofite end or the Needle, reflecting the 
South, fhould have fixed itfelf over the Point S of the laid Line of Declination, then the 
Plane would have declined 45 Deg. North-eaftwardly. 

.Again, If the Index be round between A and H, and the North-end of the Needle over 
the Point S of its Line of Declination, then the Declination or the Plane will be South- 
eaftwardly ; but if in this Situation of the Index, the South-end of the Needle fixes itfelf 
over the laid Point S, then the Plane will decline North-weftwardly. 

If the Sun fhines upon the Wall or Plane whofe Declination is fought, and the time of the 
Day be known exactly by fome good Dial, as the Aftronomic Ring Dial, we may find the 
Declination of the Wall or Plane by means of a fmall horizontal Dial fattened on the Index, 
which muft be turned 'till the Style of the Dial mews the exact Time of the Day ; and then 
the Degrees of one of the Quadrants cut by the Fiducial Line of the Index, will be the 
Wall or Plane's Declination : and by this means may be avoided the Errors caufed by the 
Compafs, as well on account of the Variation of the Needle, as becaule of Iron concealed 
near the Compafs. 

When the Sun fhines upon a Wall, we may find likewife the Subftyle or proper Meridian 
by means of obferving two Extremities of the Shadow of an Iron-Rod, in the manner we 
have above mentioned, and afterwards the Declination ; or elfe we may draw a meridian 
Line upon an horizontal Plane near the Wall, which being produced to the Wall, will be a 
means to find the Declination thereof, as alfo to find the Variation of the Needle. Now the 
manner of drawing a Meridian Line is thus : 
5.M. Draw a Circle upon fome level Plane, (fuppofe this to be reprefented by the Figure M) 

and in the Center thereof fet up a fharp Style very upright, or elfe fix a crooked Style in 
fome Place, as A, in fuch manner, that a Line drawn from its fharp end to the Center of 
the faid Circle be perpendicular to the Plane of the Circle ; which you may do by a Square. 
But before you draw the Circle, it is neceffary to know the Length of the Shadow of the 
Style, that fo the Circumference of the Circle may be drawn thro' the Extremity of the 
Shadow of the Style oblerved fome time before Noon. Now the Circle being drawn, fup- 
pofe the Extremity of the Shadow touches the Circumference of the Circle in the Morning 
at the Point G, and about as many Hours after Noon as when in the Morning you obferved 
the Extremity of the faid Shadow in G before Noon, you find the Extremity of the Shadow 
again to touch the Circumference of the Circle in F ; then if the Arc F G be biftcted in the 
Point C, and the Diameter B C be drawn, this Diameter will be a meridian Line. 

If you have a mind to find a meridian Line when the Sun is in the equinoctial Line, 
there is no need of drawing a Circle, for all the Extremities of the Shadow of the Style 
will then be in a right Line, as ED, which is the common Section of the Equinoctial and 
the horizontal Plane ; and fo any right Line, as B C, cutting E D at right Angles, will be 
a meridian Line. 

Thus having drawn a meridian Line, if the Hour-Line of 1 2 of a horizontal Dial be 
placed fo as to coincide therewith, we may have, the Time ol the Day thereby : and there- 
lore if at the fame time the Index of the Declinatory be turned fo, that the fmall horizontal 
Dial faftened thereon fhews the fame Hour or Part, then the Degrees of the Circumference of 
the Inftrument cut by the Index, will fhew the Declination of the Wall or Plane. Or elfe 
you may produce the abovefaid meridian Line 'till it cuts the declining Plane, for then it 
will make two unequal Angles with the horizontal Line drawn upon the Plane, viz. an 
acute and obtufe Angle, which being meafured with all the Exactnefs poffible, the Difference 
between either of thefe Angles and a right Angle, will be the Declination of the Plane. For 
Example, if the acute Angle be 50 Deg. and confequently the obtufe one 130 Deg. then the 
Difference between either of them and a right Angle, will be 40 Deg. for the Declination of 
the Plane. 

If you have a mind to find the Variation of the Needle, apply one of the Sides of the 
fquare Box of the Compafs along the meridian Line drawn on the Plane ; and when the 
^Needle is at reft, obferve how many Degrees the North Point thereof is diftant from the 
Flower-de-luce of the Card -, and thefe Degrees will be the Needle's Declination or Variation ; 
but this Variation will not laft long, for it changes continually. Note, When the Declina- 
tions of Planes be taken with a Compafs, you muft have regard to the Variation of the 
Needle, in letting it reft over a Line fhewing the Variation, which is drawn commonly on 
the Bottom of the Compafs-Box. 

The Ufe of the Declinatory in taking the Inclinations of Planes. 

This Inftrument ferves to take the Inclinations of Planes, as well as their Declinations, 
that is, the Angles the Planes make with the Horizon, and for this end there is a little Hole 
in the Center G, having a Plumb-Line faftened therein. 

The 



Chap. 3. of Sun-Dials. 2,29 

The 17th Figure mews the manner of taking the Declinations aud Inclinations of Planes. 
The Plane A, of this Figure, whereon the Declinatory is applied, is a vertical Meridional 
undeclining Plane. The Plane B declines South North-weftwardly 44 Degres. The Plane C, 
is a direct Weft one. The Plane D, declines 45 Degrees North-weftwardly. And the 
other Declinations are taken in the fame manner, in applying the Side A B of the Declina- 
tory to them, fo that the Plane of the Semi-circle be parallel to the Horizon. 

Now to meafure the Angle of a Plane's Inclination, you muft apply fome one of the other 
Sides of the Inftrument to the Plane or Wall, and keeping the Plane of the Semi-circle per- 
pendicular to the Horizon, fee what Number of Degrees of the Circumference thereof 
the Plumb-Line plays upon, for thefe will be the quantity of the faid Angle of Incli- 
nation. 

If, for example, the Side CD be applied to the Plane E, and the Plumb-Line plays 
upon the Line G H, then the faid Plane will be parallel to the Horizon. But if the Side 
CAof the Inftrument being applied on the Plane F, and the Plumb Line plays, as per Fi- 
gure, this Plane inclines 45 Degrees upwards. Again, If the Inftrument being applied to 
the Plane G, and the Plumb-Line plays upon the Diameter, then this Plane is vertical. And 
laftly, If the Side AC, being applied on the Plane H, and the Plumb-Line plays as per Fi- 
gure, then the Inclination thereof will be 45 Deg* downwards.

Of the ConjlruSlion and Ufes of Injlruments, for drawing upon 
Dials the Arcs of the Signs, the Diurnal Arcs, the Babylonick 
and Italian Hours, the Almacanters, and the Meridians of principal 
Cities, 

WE now proceed to defcribe upon Dials certain Lines which the Shadow of the Ex- 
tremity of the Style pafTes over, when the Sun enters into each of the 12 Signs of 
the Zodiack. 

Of the Trigon of Signs i 
The firft Figure reprefents the Triangle or Trigon of Signs, made of Brafs or any other "Plats 23. 
folid Matter of a bignefs at pleafure. The Conftruction of this is thus: Firft draw the Fig. 1. 
Line a b, reprefenting the Axis of the World, and ac perpendicular thereto, reprefen' ng 
the Radius of the Equinoctial, and about the Point a defcribe the circular Arc dc e at plea- 
fure. This being done, reckon 23 4 Deg. both ways from the Point c upon the faid Arc, 
for the Sun's greateft Declination, and draw the two Lines, a d, a e, for the Summer and 
Winter Tropicks ; likewife draw the Line d e, which will be bifected by the Radius of the 
Equinoctial in the Point 0, about which, as a Center, draw a Circle, whofe Circumference 
paries thro' the Points d and e of the Tropicks, and divide the Circumference thereof in 12 
equal Parts, beginning from the Point d. Then thro' each Point ofDivifion equally diftant 
from d and e, draw occult Lines parallel to the Radius of the Equinoctial Circle. Thefe 
Lines will interfect the Arc dc in the Points thro' which and the Center a Lines being drawn, 
thefe Lines will reprefent the beginnings of the Signs of the Zodiack, at 30 Deg. diftance 
from each other, 

But to divide the Signs into every 10th or 5th Degree, you muft divide the Circumference 
of the Circle into 36 or 72 equal Parts. After this, we denote the Characters of the Signs 
upon each Line, as appears /w Figure. And when the Trigon is divided into every 10th or 
5th Degree, we place the Letter of the Month to the firft io Degrees of each Sign agreeing 
therewith. 

But the Trigon of Signs may be readier made by the means of a Table of the Sun's Decli- 
nation j for having drawn the two Lines ab and a c at right Angles, lay the Center of a 
Protractor on the Point a, with its Limb towards the Point C\ and keeping it fixed thus, 
count 23 ~ Deg. on both fides the Radius a c, for the Tropicks of 25 and Vf, 20 Deg. 12 Min. 
for the beginnings of the Signs si, n, t and ,sr, and 11 Deg. 30 Min for «, m m. and X. 
And in this manner we divide the Spaces for each Sign into every 10th or 5th Deg. by means 
of the following Table of the Sun's Declination. Note, The Equinoctial Points of r and *±

By this Table we may know the Sun's Declination and Diftance from the Equinoctial 
Points each Day at Noon, in every Degree of the Signs of the Zodiack, the greateft Decli- 
nation being 23 Deg. 3oMin. tho' at prefent it is but about 23 Deg. 29 Min. but a Minute 
difference is of no confequence in the Ufe of Dials. The Degrees of the firfl Column to the 
Left-hand, are for the Signs kt down upon the Top of the Table, and the Degrees in the lait 
Column numbered upwards, are for the Signs fet at the Bottom of the Table. 

Of the Trigon of Diurnal Arcs. 

'The fecond Figure reprefents the Trigon of Diurnal and Noclumal Arcs. Thefe are drawn 
upon Sun-Dials by Curve-Lines, like the Arcs of the Signs, and by means of them the Shadow 
of the Style fhews how many Hours the Sun is above the Horizon, in any given Day, that is, 
the Length of the Day, and confequently the Length of the Night too -, for this is the Com- 
plement of that to 24 Hours. 

The Trigon of Signs is the fame for all Latitudes, fince the Sun's Declination is the fame 
ior all the Earth : but the Diurnal Arcs are different for every particular Latitude, and we 
draw as many of thefe Arcs upon a Dial, as there are Hours of Difference between the longeft 
and fhorteft Days of the Year. 

Now to conftrutt the Trigon of Diurnal Arcs upon Brafs or any other folid Matter, firft 
draw the right Line R Z for the Radius of the Hour-Line of 12, or of the Equinoctial ; 
and about the Point R, with any Opening of your Compaffts taken at pleafure, dcfcribe the 

circular 



Pbre XX1L 



flVnWIj page 2.J.: 




Chap. 3. of Sun-F)ials. 231 

circular Arc T SV, and lay off both ways thereon from the Point S, two Arcs, each equal 
to the Complement of the Latitude. For Example, if the Latitude be 49 Deg. make the 
Arcs S V, and ST, of 41 Deg. each. This being done, draw the right Line T X V, and 
about the Point X, as a Center, defcribe the Circumference of a Circle TZVY, which 
divide into 48 equal Parts by dotted Lines, drawn parallel to the Radius of the Equinoctial 
R Z: then thefe Lines will cut the Diameter T X V in Points, thro' which and the Point 
R, you may draw the Radius's of the Hours. And fince the Jongeft Day at Paris is 16 
Hours, and the fhorteft 8, you need but draw four Radius's on one Side the Line R Z, arfd 
a like Number on the other Side. 

Moreover, the Angles that all the Radius's make at the Point R may be found Trigono- 
metrically, by the following Analogy, viz. As Radius is to the Tangent Complement of the 
Latitude, So is the Tangent of the Difference between the Semidiurnal Arc at the time of 
the Equinox and the Arc propofed, to the Tangent of the Sun's requifite Declination. For 
Example; Suppofe it be required to draw upon the Trigon the diurnal Arc of 11 or 13 
Hours, the Semidiurnal Arc is 5 t Hours, or 6 l Hours, and the Day of the Equinox the 
diurnal Arc is 12 Hours ; and confequently the Semidiurnal Arc is 6 Hours, and the Difference 
is half an Hour : therefore Radius muft be put for the firft Term of the Analogy, the Tan- 
gent of 41 Deg. (viz. the Complement of the Latitude of Paris) for the fecond Term, and 
the Sine of 7 Deg. 30 Min. for the third Term. Now the fourth Term being found, the 
Sun's Declination is 6 Deg. 28 Min. South, when the Day at Paris is 11 Hours long •, and 
6 Deg. 28 Min. North, when the Day is 13 Hours •, and making three other Analogies, you 
will find that the Declination of the diurnal Arc of 10 Hours and 14 Hours, is 12 Deg. 41 
Min. of 9 Hours and 15 Hours, 18 Deg. 25 Min. and of 8 Hours and 16 Hours, 23 
Deg. 30 Min. 

Of the 'Trigon with an Index. 
The third Figure reprefents the Trigon of Signs put upon a Rule or Index A, in order Fig. 3. 
to draw the Arcs of the Signs upon great Dials. The diurnal Arcs may be drawn likewife 
upon this Trigon •, but the Arcs of the Signs and diurnal Arcs too muft not be drawn upon 
one and the fame Dial, for avoiding Confufion. In. the Center of the Index there is a little 
Hole thro' which is put a Pin, that fo the Inftrument may turn about the Center of a Dial. 
The Trigon (Tides along the Index, and may be fixed in any part thereof by means of the 
Screw B. The Arcs of the Signs with their Characters are round about the Circumference, 
and there is a fine Thread fixed in the Center thereof, in order to extend over the Radii quite 
to the Hour-Lines of a Dial, as we fhall by and by explain. 

The fourth Figure reprefents one half of a horizontal Dial, having the Morning Hour- R S-4« 
Lines to 12 o'Clock thereon, and the Equinoctial Line CD. This being enough of the 
Dial, for explaining the Manner of drawing the Arcs of the Signs thereon, by means of Fi- 
gure 5, which reprefents a Trigon of Signs drawn upon a Plate, on which the Hour-Lines 
of an horizontal Dial are adjufted in the following manner 

Take the Length of the Axis V R of the horizontal Dial between your Compaffes, and 
lay it off on the Axis of the Trigon from O to C •, after this, take the Diftance from the 
Center V of the Dial to the Point C, wherein the Equinoctial Line cuts the Hour-Line of 
12, and lay it off on the Trigon from C to a, and draw lightly the Line c a 12, cutting all 
the feven Lines of the Trigon. This being done, take upon this Line the Diftance from the 
Point c to the Interferon of the Summer Tropick, and lay it off from the Center V of the 
Dial on the Hour-Line of 12, and you will have one Point thro' which the Summer Tropick 
muft pafs ; likewife take the Diftance from the Point c to the Interferon of the Parallel of if, 
and lay it off on the Flour-Line of 12, from the Center of the Dial, and you will have a Point 
on the faid Hour-Line thro' which the Parallel of u muft pafs •, likewife affume all the other 
Diftancc-s on the Trigon, and lay them off fuccemvely on the Hour-Line of 12 of the Dial, 
from the Center to the Point thro' which the Winter Tropick paffes, which muft be the moft 
diftant from the Center of the Dial, and you will have the Points in the Hour-Line of 12 thro' 
which each of the Parallels of the Signs muft pafs. And by proceeding in this manner with 
the other Hour-Lines, you will have Points in them thro' which the Parallels of the Signs muft 
pafs. For Example, Affume on the Hour-Line of 1 1 of the Dial, the Diftance from the Cen- 
ter thereof to the Point wherein the Equinoctial Line cuts it, and lay this Diftance off upon 
the Trigon from c towards a, and draw the right Line C 1 1 ; then take the Diftances from 
the Point c to the Interferon of each of the Parallels of the Signs, and lay them off from the 
Center of the Dial, on the Hour-Line of 11, to the Points 2 2, t£c. and thofe will be Points 
in the Hour-Line of 11, thro' which the Parallels of the Signs muft pafs. Underftand the 
fame for others. 

But becaufe the Hour-Line of 6 is parallel to the Equinoctial Line, make this likewife 
parallel to the Radius of the Equinoctial a on the Trigon : and to prick down the Line 
for the Hour of Seven in the Evening, defcribe an Arc about the Point C, as a Center, 
from the Line for the Hour of 6 to that for the Hour of 5 •, and lay off that Arc on the 
other Side of the Line for the Hour of 6, and then you may draw the Hour-Line of 7, 
which will not meet the Summer Tropick. Finally, The Line for the Hour of 8 muft 
make the fame Angle with the Line of the Hour of 6, as the Line for the Hour of .4 does ; 

but 



232 5T&amp;? Confi ruction and Ufes B o o k VI 1 1 . 

but it is ufelefs to draw this Line for the Latitude of 49 Deg. bccaufe this Line being paral- 
lel to the Tropick of as, cannot cut any one Radius to the Signs. Now the Points thro' 
which the Arcs of the Signs muftpafs, being found on the flour-Lines of the Dial, you muffc 
join all thofe that appertain to the fame Sign with an even hand ; andycu will have the curved 
Arcs of the Signs, whofe Characters muft be marked upon the Dial, as per Figure. Note 
We fometimes fet down the Names ol the Months, and of fome remarkable moveable Feafts 
upon the Dial. The Arcs of the Signs are drawn upon vertical Dials in this manner ; but 
here the Winter Tropick muft be nigheft to the Center of the Dial, and the Summer Tropick 
furtheft diftant from it. 

If the Arcs of the Signs or diurnal Arcs are to be drawn upon a great Dial, the third Fi- 
gure muft be ufed in the following manner : 
:,„. $, Faften the Rule or Index to the Center of the Dial by a Pin, fo that it may be 

turned and fixed upon any Hour-Line, as may be feen in Figure 6 : then having fixed 
the Center of the Trigon upon the Index, at a Diftance from • the Center of the Index 
equal to the Diftance from the Center of the Dial to the Extremity of the Axis there- 
of, by means of the Screw R ; take the Thread on one Hand, and with the other raife 
or lower the Inftrument upon the Plane of the Dial, fo that the Thread extended along 
the Radius of the Equinoctial of the Trigon, meets the Point wherein fome Hour-Line 
cuts the Equinoctial Line of the Dial, and in this Situation fix the Index. This being 
done, extend the Thread along the Radius's of the Trigon, and prick down the Points upon 
each Hour-Line of the Dial, thro' which the Parallels of the Signs muft pafs, both above and 
below the Equinoctial Line, as we have done on the Hour- Line of 12 of the Dial reprefent- 
cd in Figure 6. And if you do thus on all the Hour-Lines fucceffively one after the other, 
and the Points marked thereon appertaining to the fame Sign, be joined by an even Hand, 
you will have the Parallels of the Signs upon the Surface of the Dial. But to make the 
Points on the Hour-Line of 6, the Inftrument muft be turned fo that the Fiducial Line of 
the Index be upon the Hour-Line of 12, and the Radius of the Equinoctial Circle of the 
Trigon parallel to the Hour-Line of 6. The Inftrument being thus fixed, extend the 
Thread along the Radius's of the Signs, until it cuts the Hour-Line of 6, and the Points 
where it cuts the faid Hour- Line, will be thofe thro' which the Parallels of the Signs muft 
pafs in that Hour-Line. 

When the Arcs of the Signs are drawn on one fide of the Dial, for example, on the 
Morning Hour-Lines, you may lay off the fame Diftances from the Center on the Hour-Lines 
of the ether fide the Meridian ; as the Points denoted on the Hour-Line of 1 1 muft be laid 
off on the Hour-Line of 1, thofe on the Hour-Line of 10 on the Hour- Line of 2 ', and fo 
draw the Arcs of the Signs on the other fide of the Meridian. Note, The Arcs of the Signs 
are drawn upon declining Dials in the fame manner, if the Subftylar Line be made ufeof in- 
ftead of the Meridian, and the Diftances from the Center be taken equal upon thofe Hour- 
Lines equally diftant on both fides of the Subftyle from it. 

If the diurnal Arcs are to be pricked down upon a Dial inftead of the Arcs of the Signs, 
that is, the Length of the Days, we may likewife put thereon the Hour of the Sun's rifing 
and fetting, if the Length of the Day be divided into two equal Parts. For example, when 
the Day is 15 Hours long, the Sun fets half an Hour pafb 7 in the Afternoon, and rifes half 
an Hour paft 4 in the Morning ; and fo of others. 

If the Arcs of the Signs are to be drawn upon Equinoctial Dials, as on that of Figure 7, 
Plate 22, take the length of the Axis of the Style AD, and lay it off upon the Axis of the 
Trigon (of Figure 5. Plate 23.) from O to P, and draw the Line PN parallel to the Ra- 
dius of the Equinoctial ; this* fhall cut "the Summer Tropick and two x other Parallels : then 
take the Diftance from the Point P to the Inter feet ion.of the Tropick of as ; and with that 
Diftance about the Center A of the Dial draw a Circle^ which fhall reprefent the Tropkrk of 
2?. Take likewife the two other Diftances on the Parallel of the Trigon, and draw two 
other Circles about the Center of the Dial, the one for the Parallel of u and Si, and the 
other fipr that of « and "3?, which may be drawn upon an upper Equinoctial Dial. But if 
this was an under Equinoctial Dial, then the above defcribed Circles would reprefent the 
Parallels of n\, f, v$, .^ and x : but as for the Parallels of &lt;r and ^, they cannot be drawn 
upon Equinoctial Dials, becaufe when the Sun is in the Plane of the Celeftial Equator, his 
Rays fall parallel to the Surfaces of Equinoctial Dials, and the Shadows of their Styles are 
indefinitely protended. 

The Horizontal Line is thus drawn : Firft lay off the Style's length on the Hour-Line of 
6, and about the Extremity D thereof, defcribe the Arc E F (upwards for an upper Dial) 
equal to the Latitude, viz. 49 Deg. for Paris, and draw the Line D F, which fhall cut the 
Meridian in the Point H, thro' which the horizontal Line muft be drawn parallel to the 
Hour-Line of 6, as may be feen in Figure 7, Plate zi. 

The Ufe of this Line is to fhew the rifing and fetting of the Sun at his entrance into 
the beginning of each Sign. For example, becaufe it cus the Tropick of Cancer on the 
Dial, in Points thro'' which the Hour-Line of 4 in the Morning, and 8 in the Evening pafs •, 
therefore the Sun rifes the Day of the Solftice at 4 in the Morning, and fets at 8 in the 



Evening at Paris. Underftand the fame of others.

Chap, 3. of Sun-Dials. 233 

To draw the Arcs of the Signs upon Polar Dials. 

The Dial being drawn (as appears in Fig. 6. Plate 22.), the dotted Radii of the Hours 
continued out 'till they meet the Equinoctial Line mud be laid off fucceflively upon the Ra- 
dius of the Equinoctial of the Trigon of Signs (Fig. 5. Plate 23.) for drawing as many Per- 
pendiculars thereon as there are dotted Radii, viz. one for the Hour of 12, and the five 
others for the Hours of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which mail cut the Radii of the Signs of the 
Trigon. This being done, take the Diftances from the Radius of the Equinoctial of the 
Trigon upon the faid Perpendiculars, to the Radius's of the other Signs, and lay them off 
upon the Hour-Lines of the Dial on both fides the Equinoctial Line A B. For Example ; 
Take the Diftance 12 b, and lay it off on the Dial from the Point C upon the Hour-Line 
of 12, and you will have two Points in the faid Line thro' which the Tropicks muff pafs. 
Likewife take the Space on the Trigon upon the Line 5 kf or sf, and lay it off upon the 
Hour-Lines of 5 and 7 on both fides the Equinoctial Line of your Dial, and you will have 
Points in the Hour-Lines of 5 and 7, thro' which the Tropicks muft pafs. And in this 
manner may Points be found in the other Hour-Lines thro' which the faid Tropicks muff pafs ; 
as alfo the Points in the Hour-Lines thro' which the Parallels of the other Signs muft be 
drawn, which being found muft be joined. Note, We have only drawn the two Tropicks 
in the Figure of this Dial for avoiding Confufion. And the Parallels of the Northern Signs 
muft be drawn underneath the Equinoctial Line, and the Southern Signs above it. Alfo the 
diurnal Arcs are drawn in the fame manner as the Arcs of the Signs are. 

How to draw the Arcs of the Signs upon Eaft and Weft Dials. 

The Arcs of the Signs are drawn nearly in the fame manner upon Eaft and Weft Dials 
as upon Polar ones : for Example, Let it be required to draw the Arcs of the Signs upon the 
Welt Dial of Figure 8. Plate 22. the dotted Radii of the Flours produced to the Equinoctial 
Line C D, muft be laid off upon the Trigon of Figure 1. (Plate 23.) from the Point a upon 
the Radius of the Equinoctial, that fo Perpendiculars may be drawn upon the Trigon cut- 
ting the Radius's of the Signs ; after this, you muft take upon the faid Perpendiculars the 
Diftances from the Radius of the Equinoctial to the Interfection of the Radii of the other Signs, 
and lay them off upon the Hour-Lines of the Dial, on both fides the Equinoctial Line. For 
Example, Take the Space 6 &gt;tf, or 2?, and lay it off on both fides the Point D upon the 
Hour-Line of 6 on the Dial : Proceed in this manner for finding Points in the other Hour- 
Lines thro' which the Curve Parallels of the Signs muft be drawn with an even Hand, fo 
that the Northern ones be under the Equinoctial Line, and the Southern ones above it. Note, 
The diurnal Arcs are drawn in the fame manner ; and we have only drawn the two Tropicks 
thereon for avoiding Confufion. 

The Conftruclion of a horizontal Dial, having the Italian and Babylonian Hours j as alfo 
the Almacanters and Meridians defcribed upon it. 

Having already fhewed the manner of pricking down the Aftronomical Hours upon Sun- 
Dials, as alfo the Diurnal Arcs, and Arcs of the Signs, there may yet be feveral other Circles 
of the Sphere reprefented upon Dials, being pleafant and ufeful, which the Shadow of the 
Extremity of the Style paffes over ; as the Italian and Babylonian Hours, the Azimuths, the 
Almacanters, and the Meridians of principal Cities. 

The firft Line of the Italian and Babylonian Hours is the Horizon, like as the firft Line of 
the Aftronomical Hours is the Meridian ; for the Italians begin to reckon their Hours when 
the Center of the Sun touches the Horizon at his fetting, and the Babylonians when he touches 
the Horizon at his rifing. 

A general Method for drawing the Italian and Babylonian Hours upon all kinds of Dials. 

The Aftronomical Hour-Lines, and the Equinoctial Line being drawn, as alfo a diurnal Fig. 7. 
Arc or Parallel of the Sun's rifing for any Hour, at pleafure, as, for the Hour of 4 at Paris, 
which Arc will be the. fame as the Summer Tropick, you may find two Points (as we fhall 
iliew here) in each of the aforefaid Lines, viz. one in the Equinoctial Line, and the other 
in the diurnal Arc drawn, by means of which it will not be difficult to prick down the 
Italian and Babylonian Hour-Lines •, becaufe they being the common Sections of great Circles 
of the Sphere and a Dial- Plane, will be reprefented in right Lines thereon. 

Now fuppofe it be required to draw the firft Babylonian Hour-Line upon the horizontal 
Dial of Figure 7, firft confider that when the Sun is in the Equinoctial he rifes at 6, and at 
7 he has been up juft an Flour ; whence it follows, that the firft Babylonian Hour-Line muft 
pafs thro' the Point wherein the Aftronomical Hour-Line of 7 cuts the Equinoctial Line ; 
the fecond thro' the Interfection of the Hour-Line of 8 j the third thro' that of the Flour- 
Line of 9 ; and fo of others. 

But when the Sun rifes at 4 in the Morning, the Point in the Tropick of as, wherein 
the Hour Line of j cuts it, is that thro' which the firft Babylonian Hour-Line muft pafs ; the 
Interfection of the i four-Line of 6 in the faid Tropick, that thro' which the fecond Babyloni- 
an flour- Line muft pafs •, the Interfection of the Hour-Line of 7 with the faid Tropick, that 
Point thro' which the third Babylonian Hour-Line muft pafs j and fo of others. Then if a 

O o o Ruler 



^34 ^ je C° n ft ru fii°H an d Ufes Book VI 1 1. 

Ruler be laid to the Point wherein the Hour-Line of 5 cuts the Tropick of Cancer, and or 
the Point in the Equinoctial Line cut by the Hour-Line of 7, and you draw a right Line" 
thro' them ; this Line will reprefent the fir ft Babylonian Hour-Line. Proceeding in this 
manner for the other Babylonian Hour-Lines, you will find that the 8th Babylonian Hour-Line 
will pafs thro' the Point the Tropick of Cancer is cut by the Aftronomical Hour-Line of 1 2, 
and the Point in the Equinoctial cut by the Hour-Line of 12 ; and the 5th Babylonian flour- 
Line thro' the Point in the faid Tropick cut by the Hour-Line of 7 in the Evening, and the 
Point in the Equinoctial Line cut by the Hour-Line of 5. 

One of the Babylonian Hour-Lines being drawn, it is afterwards eafy to draw all the' 
others ; becaufe they proceed orderly from one Aftronomical Hour-Line to the other, on 
the Parallel and the Equinoctial Line, as appears /w Figure. Finally, The Sun lets at the 
16th Babylonian Hour, when the Day is 16 Hours long : he fets at the 12th when he, is in 
the Equinoctial •, and at the 8th when the Night is 16 Hours long, becaufe he always rifes 
at the 24th Babylonian Flour. 

You muft reafon nearly in the fame manner for pricking down the Italian Hour-Lines. 
Here we always reckon the Sun to fet at the 24th Flour ; and confequently in Summer, 
when the Nights are but 8 Flours long, he rifes at the 8th Italian Flour ; at the Time of the 
Equinox he rifes at the 12th Italian Hour ; and in Winter, when the Nights are 16 Hours 
long, he rifes at the 16th Italian Hour : and therefore the Hour-Line of the 23d Italian Flour 
muft pafs thro' the Interfection of the Aftronomical Hour- Line of 7, and the Summer 
Tropick the Interfection of the Hour-Line of 5, and the Equinoctial Line, and the Inter- 
fection of the Hour-Line of 3, and the Winter Tropick. But two of the faid Points are 
fufficient for drawing the faid Italian Hour-Line. The 2id Italian Hour-Line pafTes thro' 
the Interfection of the Hour-Line of 6 in the Evening, and Summer Tropick, the Interfec- 
tion of the Hour-Line of 4, and the Equinoctial Line, and the Interfection of the Hour- 
Line of 2, and the Winter Tropick. Proceeding on thus, you will find that the 1 8th Italian 
Hour-Line paffes thro' the Points of the 12th Equinoctial Flour, that is, at the Time of 
the Equinox, it is Noon at the 1 8th Italian Hour j whereas at the Time of the Summer 
Solftice it is Noon at the 1 6th Italian Flour, and at the Winter Solftice it is Noon at the 
20th Italian Flour, in all Places where the Pole is elevated 49 Degrees, as may be feen in the 
following Table.

The Ufe of the Italian Hour-Lines upon a Dial may be to find the Time of the Sun's 
fetting, in fubftracting the Italian Hour prefent from 24 •, and by the Babylonian Flours may 
be known the Time of the Sun's rifing. 



How to draw the Almacanters, and the Azimuths. 

The Almacanters or Circles of Altitude are reprefented upon the horizontal Dial by cor&gt; 
centrick Circles, and the Azimuths by right Lines terminating at the Foot of the Style B, 
which reprefents the Zenith, and is the common Center of all the Almacanters : and there- 
fore you need but divide the Meridian B XII into Degrees, the Extremity of the Style C 
being the Center •, and the Tangents of thofe Degrees on the Meridian will be the Semidiame- 
ters of the Almacanters, which fhall terminate at the two Tropicks. Now to find thefe Tan- 
gents, you may ufe a Quadrant like that of Figure 8, in this manner : Lay off the Length of 
the Style C B from A to H, and draw the Line II I parallel to the Side A C of the Qua- 
drant •, then will this Line be divided into a Line of Tangents by Radii drawn from the Cen- 
ter A to the Degrees of the Limb. And thefe. Tangents may be taken between your Com- 
pafTes, and laid off upon the Meridian Line B XII. in fuch manner, that the 90th Degree 
anfwers to the Point B. But fince this Dial is made for the Latitude of 49 Deg. and fo con- 
fequently the Sun in his greateft Altitude there, is but 64 Deg. 30 Min. you need only prick 
down this greateft Altitude, which will terminate at. the Summer Tropick. 

Tills 



Chap. 4. of Sun-Dials. 235 

This being done, if one of the Circles of Altitude be divided into every 10th Deg. be- 
ginning from the Meridian B XII. which is the 90th Azimuth, and thro' thefe Points of 
Divifion right Lines are drawn to the Foot of the Style B : thefe right Lines will reprefent 
the Azimuths or vertical Circles. We have not drawn them upon the Dial, for avoiding 
Confufion, but they may be eafily conceived. • 

Now the Ufe of the Almacanters is to fhew the Sun's Altitude above the Horizon at any 
time, and of the Azimuths, to fhew what Azimuth or vertical Circle the Sun is in: and 
this is known by obferving what Circle of Altitude or Azimuth Line, the Shadow of the 
Extremity of the Style of the Dial falls upon. 

"How to draw the Meridians or Circles of ' Terreftrial Longitude upon the horizontal Dial. 

About the Point D, the Center of the Equinoctial Circle, defcribe the Circumference of Fig, 7. 
a Circle, and divide it into 360 equal Parts or Degrees, or only into 36 Parts, for every 
10th Degree 5 then from the Hour-Line of 12, which reprefents the Meridian of the Place 
for which the Dial is made, viz. Paris, count 20 Deg. Weft ward for its Longitude, or Di- 
ftance from the firft Meridian pafling thro' the Point G ; on which having wrote the Number 
360, prolong the Line G D to E^ in the Equinoctial Line, and afterwards from the Center 
A draw the firft Meridian thro' E, which paries thro' the Ifland de Fer, and fo of others. 
But it will be eafier to draw the Meridians eaftwardly for every 5th or 1.0th Degree, and 
place thofe principal Cities upon them whofe Longitudes you know : as, for example, 
Rome is 10 ! Deg. more eaftwardly than Paris, Vienna 15 Deg. more eaftwardly than the faid 
City of Paris, and fo of other eminent Cities, whofe Differences of Meridians from that of 
Paris, are known by a good Globe, or Map, made according to the exact Obfervations of 
the Academy of the Sciences. 

The Ufe of thefe Meridians on the Dial* is, to tell at any time when the Sun fliines 
thereon, what Hour then it is under any one of the faid Meridians, in adding to the time 
of Day at Paris, (for which the Dial is made) as many Hours as there are times 15 Deg. of 
Difference between the Meridians, and 4 Min. of an Hour for every Degree. 

For example ; When it is Noon by this Dial at Paris, it will be One a- clock at Vienna* 
becaufe this City is more to the Eaft than Paris by 15 Deg. and confequently receives the 
Sun's Light fooner than Paris does. And at Rome it will be 42 Min. paft 12, becaufe it is 
10 4- Deg. more eaftward than Paris, and fo of others. Thefe Lines of Longitude repre- 
fent the Meridians of the Places attributed to them ; fo that when the Shadow of the Style 
falls upon any one of them, it will be Noon under that Meridian. 

CHAP. IV. 

Of the ConflruEiion and Ufes of Inflruments for drawing Dials 

upon different Planes. 

Hp HE eighth Figure reprefents a Quadrant made of Brafs or any folid Matter, of a big- pig. 8. 

f nefs at pleafure, having the Limb divided into 90 Degrees. The Ufe of this Qua- 
drant may be to find the Lengths of Tangents, and by this means to divide a right Line 
into Degrees, as we did the Meridian of the horizontal Dial (Fig. 7.) we may find likewife 
thereon the Divifions of the Equinoctial Line thro' which the Hour-Lines muft pafs, in re- 
gular Dials ; as alio in declining Dials, if the Subftyle falls exactly upon a compleat Hour- 
Line, by laying off the Length of the Radius of the Equinoctial Circle, from the Center A 
to H or L, and drawing a right Line, as H I or LM, parallel to the Radius of the Qua- 
drant AC. For example, the Length L 1 or n, anfwering to 15 Deg. of the Ouadrant, 
fhall be the Tangent of the firft Hour-Line's diftance from the Meridian or SubftyTe of the 
Dial, which being laid off upon the Equinoctial Line, whofe Radius is fuppofed equal to 
AL, will determine a Point therein thro' which the faid Hour-Line muft be drawn. L 12, 
anfwering to 30 Deg. of the Limb of the Quadrant, will be the Tangent of the fecond 
Hour-Line's diftance from the Meridian or Subftyle. L 3, the Tangent of 45 Deg. will be 
that of the third, and fo on. Now if by this means you draw the Hour- Lines of three Hours 
fucceftively on each fide the Meridian or Subftyle, which in all make fix Hours fucceffively •, 
thefe are fufficient for finding the Hour Lines of the other Hours, according to the Method 
before explained in fpeaking of declining Dials, and which may be even applied to all re- 
gular Dials. For example, If the Hour-Lines of fix Hours fucceffive be drawn upon an 
horizontal Dial, as, from 9 in the Morning to 3 in the Afternoon, you may draw all the 
other Hour-Lines of the Dial by the aforefaid Method; as the Hour-Lines of 7 and 8 in 
the Morning, and 4 and 5 in the Afternoon, whofe Points in the Equinoctial Line are 

fome- 



236 The ConftruBion and Ufes Book VIIL 

fometimes troublefome to be pricked down, and principally the Points of the Hour-Lines of 
5 and 7, becaufe of the Lengths of their Tangents. 

The Hour-Lines found by the abovefaid Method, which we fhall not here repeat, will 
ferve for finding of others ; and thefe which are laft found being produced beyond the Cen- 
ter, will give the oppofite ones. 

The laid Quadrant will ferve moreover as a portable Dial, fince the Hour-Lines may be 
drawn upon it by means of a Table of the Sun's Altitude above die Horizon of the Place 
for which the Dial is to be made. See more of this in the next Chapter. 

The Conflrufiion of a moveable horizontal Dial. 

Fl i- 9- This Inftrument is compofed of two very fmooth and even Plates of Brafs, or other folid 

Matter, adjufted upon each other, and joined together by means of a round Rivet in the 
Center A. The undermoft Plate is fquare, the Length of the Side thereof being from 6 
to 8 Inches, and is divided into twice 90 Degrees ; by means of which, the Declinations of 
Planes may be taken. The upper Plate is round, being about 8 Lines fhorter in Diameter 
than is the Length of the Side of the under Plate, and having a little Index joined to the 
Hour-Line of 12, (hewing the Degree of a Plane's Declination. 

About the Center A is drawn an horizontal Dial upon the upper Plate, for the Latitude 
of the Place it is to be ufed in, and the Axis B is fo adjufted, that the Point thereof ter- 
minates in the Center A, wherein a fmall Hole is made for a Thread to come thro'. There 
is alfo a Compafs D fattened to this upper Plate, having a Line in the Bottom of the Box, 
fhewing the Variation of the Needle. 

The Ufe of the moveable horizontal Dial. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument is for drawing Dials upon any Planes, of whatfoever Situa- 
tions (as on declining inclining Planes, or both) in the following manner : 

Firft draw a Horizontal or level Line upon the propofed Plane •, place that fide of the 
Square along this Line, whereon is wrote the Side applied to the Wall, and turn the horizontal 
Dial 'till the Needle fettles itfelf over the Line of Declination in the Bottom of the Box : 
then extend the Thread along the Axis of the Dial 'till it meets the Plane, and the Point 
wherein it meets the faid Plane will be the Center of the Dial. This being done, extend 
the Thread along each of the Hour-Lines of the horizontal Dial that the Plane can receive, 
and mark the Points on the horizontal Line upon the Plane, cut by the Thread : then if 
Lines be drawn from the Center found on the Plane thro' each of thofe Points, thofe will 
be the refpective Hour-Lines that the Thread was extended along on the horizontal Dial, 
and mult have the fame Figures fet to them. Note, If the Dial be vertical, not having any 
Declination, the Flour-Line of 12 will be perpendicular to the horizontal Line of the Plane. 

The lubftylar Line is drawn thro' the Center of the Plane, and the Angular Point of a 
Square, one Side whereof being laid along the horizontal Line, and the other Side touching 
the Style of the horizontal Dial. 

Again, The Diftance from the Side of the Square laid along the Plane to the Axis, is the 
Length of the right Style, which being laid along in the fame Place at right Angles to the 
Subftyle, you may draw the Axis from the Center to the Extremity thereof-, which may be 
iormed on the Plane by means of an Iron Rod, parallel to the Situation of the Thread ex- 
tended along the Axis of the horizontal Dial, and muft be fuftained by a Prop planted in 
the Plane perpendicular to the Subftyle. 

If you have a mind to have a right Style only, fome Point muft be fought in the Subftyle 
diftant from the Center of the Dial, proportional to the Bignefs of the Dial, and an Iron- 
Rod muft be fet up perpendicularly therein : but the Point of this Rod muft touch the 
Thread extended along the Axis. Finally, You may give what Figure you pleafe to the 
Dial, and produce the Flour-Lines as is neceffary, according to the bignefs of the Plane. 
If a great Dial is to be drawn, you may place the Inftrument at a Diftance from the Plane 
it is to be drawn on j but then you muft take care that it be very level, and the Side thereof 
parallel to the Plane. And if North Dials are to be drawn, having firft found the Declination 
of the Plane, for Example, 45 Deg. North-weftwardly, place the Index of the Dial over 
the Degree of the oppofite Declination on the fquare Plate, viz. over 45 Deg. South-eaft- 
wardly, then invert the whole Inftrument, and extend the Thread along the Axis, that fo the 
Center of the Dial may be found upon the Plane underneath the horizontal Line, on which 
having pricked down the Points thro' which the Hour-Lines mult pats, you may draw them 
to the Center, and then proceed as before. 

The Conjlruftion of the Sciaterra. 

F'g- &gt;o. This Inftrument is compofed of an Equinoctial Circle A, made of Brafs or any other folid 

Matter, adjufted upon a Quadrant B. The Point of the Hour of 1 2 of this Equinoctial Circl- 
is fattened to one end of the Quadrant, and a little Steel Cylinder about two Lines in Diame- 
ter, fcrving for an Axis, and going thro' the Center of the Equinoctial Circle, is fo fixed to 
the other End C of the Quadrant, as to keep the faid Equinoctial Circle fixed at right Angles 
to the- Quadrant. 

The 



Chap. 4. of Sun-Dials. 237 

The Quadrant is divided into 90 Deg. and is made to Aide on the Top of the Piece L, 
according to different Elevations of the Pole. The little Ball G is hung at the End of a 
Thread, whofe other End is fattened to the Top of an upright Line on the Piece L, and fo 
by means of this, and the Ball and Socket H, the Inftrument may be fet upright. The 
Piece I is of Steel, and the End thereof is forced into a Wall or Plane, to fupport the whole 
Inftrument when it is to be ufed. The Figure D is the Trigon of Signs put on the Axis, 
and turns about the fame by means of a Ferril. This Trigon has a Thread F fattened to 
the Extremity thereof, and there is another Thread E fattened, to the Center of the Dial. 
But note, We do not place the Trigon upon the Axis, unlefs when the Arcs of the Signs are 
to be drawn upon Dials. 

The Ufe of the Sciaterra. 

You muft firft force the Steel Point I, into the Wall or Plane whereon a Dial is to be drawn, 
and place the Quadrant to the Degree of the Elevation of the Pole : then you muft take a 
Square Compafs^ and lay the Side thereof along the Plane of the Quadrant, and turn the 
Inftrument until the Needle fixes itfelf directly over the Line of Declination ; or if you 
have not a Compafs when the Sun fhines, and the Hour of the Day is known, turn the In- 
ftrument 'till the Shadow of the Axis falls upon the Hour of the Day upon the Equinoctial 
Circle. 

The Inftrument being thus difpofed, extend the Thread E from the Center along the Axis 
'till it meets the Wall or Plane propofed, and there make a Point for the Center of the Dial : 
then extending the faid Thread over each Hour of the Equinoctial, note the Points wherein 
it meets the Wall or Plane, and draw Lines from the Center (before found) thro' them, and 
thofe will be the Hour-Lines. After this, you may give the Dial what Figure you pleafe, 
and fet the fame Figures upon the Hour-Lines as are upon the correfpondent Hours of the 
Equinoctial Circle. Note, The Style is fet up in the manner we have mentioned in fpeaking 
of the moveable horizontal Lial. 

If the Arcs of the Signs, or diurnal Arcs, are to be drawn upon the Dial, you muft put 
the Ferril at the End of the Trigon upon the Axis, and fix it over each Hour of the Equi- 
noctial one after another by means of the Screw : then extending the Thread F along the Lines 
appertaining to each Sign, mark as many Points on each Hour-Line on the Wall or Plane, 
and join them by curve Lines, which fhall form the Arcs of the Signs, whereon muft be fet 
their refpective Characters. 

The Arcs of the Signs may be otherwife drawn in the following manner : The Akis of the 
Dial being well fixed, chufe a Point in the fame for the Extremity of the right Style, repre- 
fenting the Center of the Earth •, and upon this Axis put the Ferril of the Trigon in fuch 
manner, that the Extremity of the right Style exactly anfwers to the Vertex of the Trigon, 
reprefenting the Center of the Equinoctial and the World. Then having fixed the Trigon 
by means of the Screw prefling againft the Ax\s, turn it fo that one of the Planes thereof 
(for the Signs ought to be drawn upon both fides) falls exactly upon the Hour-Lines one 
after another, and extend the Thread F along the Radius's of the Signs on the Trigon, and 
by means thereof mark Points upon each Hour-Line of the Wall or Plane : and if thefe 
Points be joined, we fhall have the Arcs of the Signs. 

Proceed thus for drawing North Dials, as likewife inclining and declining Dials, in ob- 
ferving to invert the Inftrument when the Centers of the Dials are downwards. 

The Conjlruftion of M. Pardie'j Sciaterra. 

This Inftrument, which is made of Brafs or other folid Matter, of a Bignefs at pleafure* Fig. 11. 
confifts of four principal Pieces or Parts. The firft is a very even fquare Plate D, called the 
horizontal Plane, becaufe it is placed horizontal or level when ufing, having a round Hole 
E in the Middle, wherein is placed a Pivot, upon which turns the fecond Piece, called the 
meridional Plane, in fuch manner that the faid Piece is always at right Angles to the hori- 
zontal Plane. On the narrow Side C of this Piece is fattened a Plumb- Line, whofe ufe is for 
placing the Inftrument level. The Top of this Piece is cut away into a concave Quadrant, 
both fides of which are divided into 90 Deg. beginning from the Perpendicular anfwering to 
the Middle of the Pivot, and there is a pretty deep Slit made down the Middle of this Qua- 
drant to receive a prominent Piece of a Semi-Circle H, which is the third principal part, 
that fo the faid Semi-Circle may be in the fame Plane as the fecond Piece is, and likewife 
be raifed or lowered according to different Elevations of the Pole. The Diameter of this 
Semi-Circle is called the Axis, and the Center thereof is (imply called the Center of the In- 
ftrument, like as the Thread fattened thereto is called the centeral Thread. The fourth Piece 
A is a very even Circle, both fides thereof being divided into 24 equal Parts, for the 24 
Hours of the Day ; and this is fixed at right Angles to the Semi-Circle H, and fo moves a- 
long with it. One of the Sides thereof is called the upper-fide, and the other the under- fide. 
The Trigon of Signs is drawn (in the manner before explained) upon both fides of the Semi- 
Circle, having the Point A, the Extremity of the Diameter of the Equinoctial Circle, for 
the Vertex thereof.

The Ufe of this Injlrument. 

Having firft placed the Points of ir and =a= of" the Semi-Circle upon the Degree of the 
Elevation of the Pole in the Place for which you would draw a Dial, fet the Inftrument upon 
a fixed horizontal Plane, near to the Wall or Plane you are to draw a Dial on. Then turn 
the Meridional Plane 'till the Shadow of the Equinoctial Circle falls upon the Day of the 
Month or Degree of the Sign on the Axis the Sun is in. This being done, the Shadow of 
the faid Axis or Diameter of the Semi-Circle H, will fhew the Time of Day upon the Equi- 
noctial Circle, and the whole Inftrument will be well fituated, the Meridional Plane 
anfwering to the Meridian of the Heavens, the Equinoctial Circle parallel to the Celeilial 
Equinoctial Circle, and the Axis of the Dial parallel to the Axis of the World. This being 
done, extend the Thread F fattened to the Center, along the Axis to the Wall or Plane 
you are to draw a Dial on, and the Point wherein it meets the Wall will be the Center of 
the Dial. The faid Thread thus extended will likewife give the Pofition of the Style or 
Axis of the Dial ; for if an Iron Rod be placed in the faid Point of Concourfe, and in the 
fame Situation as the Thread is, this will be the Style of the Dial : but if you have a mind 
to have a right Style only, you need but fet up a Rod in the Wall or Plane, whofe end 
touches the Thread extended along the Axis of the Inftrument ; and this Rod may have what 
Figure you pleafe given to it, as a Serpent or Bird, provided the Extremity of the Bill there- 
of meets the faid Thread. 

Now to mark the Hour-Lines upon the Dial, extend the Thread from the Center over 
the Plane of the Equinoctial Circle along the Hour- Lines thereof one after another, until it 
meets the Wall : then if Lines be drawn from the Center of the Dial to the faid Points of 
Concourfe, thefe will be the Hour-Lines. But the Hour-Lines may be otherwife pricked 
down in the Night, by the light of a Link or Candle ; for the centeral Thread being firft 
extended along the Axis, and faftened to the Wall, afterwards move the Link 'till the Shadow 
of the Axis falls upon any given Hour upon the Equinoctial Circle, and then the Shadow 
of the faid extended Thread upon the Wall will be the fame Hour- Line ; and by draw- 
ing a Line upon the Wall along the fame with a Pencil, that will be the Hour-Line. 

Proceed thus for drawing the other Hour-Lines. Note, This Method of drawing Dials 
is a very good one, particularly when a Surface is not flat and even, or when the Center of 
the Dial falls at a great Diftance. You muft obferve likewife, that the Shadow of the Axis 
of the Inftrument fhews the Time of Day on the upper-fide of the Equinoctial Circle from 
the 20th of March (N. S.) to the 22d of September, and on the under-fide the other fix 
Months ; and the Side of the Equinoctial Circle that the Sun Ihines upon, muft always but 
juft touch the Center of the Semi-Circle. 

CHAP. V. 

Of the Conflruciion and Ufes of Portable Dials, 

Of the ConJlruRion of a Globe. 

.12. fTT^ H I S Figure reprefents a Globe, whereon are drawn the Meridians or Hour-Circles. 
X There are divers Sizes of them •, the great ones are fet up in Gardens, and are of Stone 
or Wood well painted, and the fmall ones are made of Brafs, having CompafTes belonging 
to them, and may be reckoned among the Number of Portable Dials. 

The manner of turning round Balls of any Matter is well known, but if a large Stone- 
Ball is to be made, that cannot be turned becaufe of it's Weight : firft, you muft nighly 
form it with a Chifiel, and then take a wooden or brafs Semi-Circle of the fame Diameter 
as you defign your Ball. This being done, turn the Semi-Circle about the Ball, and take 
away all the Superfluities with a Rafpe, until the Semi-Circle every where and way juft 
touches the Superficies thereof j afterwards make it fmooth with a Pumice-Stone or Sea- Dog 
Fifh's Skin, fefr. 

The Globe being well rounded and made fmooth, you muft take the Diameter thereof 
with a Pair of Spheric CompafTes, viz. fuch whofe Points are crooked, which fuppofe the 
right Line A B - t this Line is divided into two equal Parts in E by the vertical Line Z N, 
the upper Point whereof Z, reprefents the Zenith, and the lower one N, the Nadir. Now 
fet one Point of the Spheric CompafTes in E, and extend the other to A, and draw the Me- 
ridian Circle AZBN; likewife fetting one Foot of your CompafTes in Z, with the laft 
Opening defcribe the Circle A E B, reprefenting the Horizon -, and from the Point B to C 
count 49 Deg. the Elevation of the Pole on the Meridian, and fetting one Foot of your 
CompafTes in the Point C, reprefenting the North Pole, extend the other to 41 Deg. on the 
Meridian below the Point B, and draw the Equinoctial Circle ; likewife fetting one Foot of 

your 



Chap. 5. of Sun-Dials. 239 

your Compares, opened to the fame Diftance as before, upon the Point in the Meridian cut by 
the Equinoctial, you may draw the Hour-Circle of 6 pafling thro' the Poles C and D. By this 
means the Equinoctial mail be divided into four equal Parts by the Meridian and Hour- 
Circle of 6 ; and if each of thefe four Parts be divided into fix equal Parts, for the 24 Hours 
of a Natural Day, and about the Points of Divifion as Centers, with the extent of a Qua- 
drant of the Globe, Circles be defcribed ; thefe will all pafs thro' the Poles of the World 
C and D, and are the Hour-Circles. If you have a mind to have the half Hours or Quar- 
ters, each of the Divifions on the Equinoctial muft be divided into 2 or 4 equal Parts. 
The Hour-Circles are numbered round the Equinoctial both above and below it, as appears 
per Figure. 

If the Parallels of the Signs are to be drawn upon the Globe, you muft count Upon the 
Meridian both ways from the Equinoctial, the Declination for every Sign, according to the 
Table expreffed ; as, for Example, For the two Tropicks you muft count 23 Deg. 30 Min. 
from the Equinoctial, and about the Poles C and D, draw Circles on the Globe. Note&gt; 
The two Polar Circles muft be drawn at 23 Deg. 30 Min. from the Poles, or 66 Deg. 30 Min. 
from the Equinoctial. 

The Globe thus ordered muft be placed upon a Pedeftal proportionable to the bignefs 
thereof in a Hole made in the Nadir N, diftant from the Pole the Complement of it's Ele- 
vation (viz. 41 Deg.) and fixed in a Garden, or elfewhere, well expofed to the Sun, fo as to 
be conformable to the Sphere of the World. 

But if it be a fmall Portable Globe, we place a little Compafs upon the Pedeftal thereof* 
that fo the Globe may be fet North and South when the Hour of the Day is to be fhewn there- 
by, which is fhewn thereon without a Style, by the Shadow of the fame Globe : for the Sha- 
dow or Light thereon always occupies one half of the Globe's Convexity, when the Sun fhines 
upon it j and fo the Extremity of the Shadow or Light fhews the Hour in two oppofite 
Places. If, moreover, the different Countries on the Earth's Superficies, as likewife the 
principal Cities, are laid down upon the Globe according to their true Latitudes and Longi- 
tudes, you may difcover any Moment the Sun fhines upon the fame, by the illuminated part 
thereof, what Places of the Earth the Sun mines upon, and what Places are in Darknefs. 
The Extremity of the Shadow fhews likewife what Places the Sun is rifing or fetting at j 
and what Places have long Days, and what have fhort Nights : you may likewife diftinguifh 
thereon the Places towards the Poles that have perpetual Night and Day. All this is eafy to 
be underftood by thofe who are acquainted with the Nature of the Sphere. Note, This Dial 
is the moft natural of all others, becaufe it refembles the Earth itfelf, and the Sun mines 
thereon as he does on the Earth. 

You may find the Hour of the Day otherwife, by means of a thin brafs Semi-Circle di* 
vided into twice 90 Deg. adjufted to the Poles or Extremes of the Axis, by help of two little 
Ferrils. This Semi-Circle being turned about the Globe with your Hand, until it only 
makes a perpendicular Shadow upon the Globe, reprefents the Hour-Circle wherein the Sun 
is, and confequently fhews the Hour of the Day, and alfo what Places of the Earth it is 
Noon at that Time. But in this Cafe the Number 12 muft be fet to the Meridian, and the 
Numbers 6 and 6 to the two Points wherein the Equinoctial cuts the Horizon : and this is 
the reafon why we commonly place two rows of Figures along the Equinoctial. The Shadow 
of the two ends of the Axis, if they are continued out far enough beyond the Poles, and 
the Hours are -figured round the Polar Circles, will likewife fhew the Hour. Note* In 
order to* make fmall Portable Globes univerfal, we adjuft Quadrants underneath them, 
that fo the Pedeftal may be flid according to the Elevation of the Pole. This is eafy to be 
underftood. 

The ConftruBion and Ufe of the Concave and Convex Semi-Cylinder. 

Thefe Dials, which are made of different bigneffes, the fmall ones of Brafs, and the great 
ones of Stone or Wood, are very curious on account of their fhewing the Hour of the Day 
without a Style. Their Exact nefs confifts very much in being very round and even both 
within fide and without. 

The 13th Figure reprefents one of thefe Dials, fet upon and fattened on it's Pedeftal, in- Fig- 13^ 
Clining to the Horizon under an Angle equal to the Elevation of the Pole, and directly facing 
the South : and therefore the Hour-Lines and the Edges A B, a b, ferving as a Style, are all 
parallel between themfelves, and to the Axis of the World. The whole Convex Cylinder is 
divided into 24 equal Parts, or twice 12 Hours, by parallel Lines ; and the Concave Semi- 
Cylinder is divided into 6 equal Parts by Right Lines, which are the Hour- Lines from 6 in 
the Morning, to 6 in the Afternoon. 

Now when the Sun fhines upon this Dial, the Hour of the Day is fhewn on the Convex 
fide thereof, by the defect of Light, that is, by a right Line feparating the Light from the 
Shadow. But the Hour of the Day is fhewn in the Concave part of the Dial, by the 
Shadow of one of the Edges A B or a b •, fo that when the Sun in the Morning is come to 
the Hour-Circle of 6. the Shadow of the eaft Edge ab will then fall upon the other Edge 
A B, which is the Hour-Line of 6 : and as the Sun rifes higher above the Horizon, the 
Shadow of the laid Kdge a b will defcend and fhew the Hour among the Hour-Lines. (Note t 

The 



240 *The Conftrulytion and Ufes Book VI I L 

The Figures on the Top are for the Morning Hours, and thofe on the Bottom for the After- 
noon ones.) When the Sun is come to the Meridian, he directly fhines into the Dial, and 
then the Edges will caft no Shadow : but when the Sun has pafled the Meridian, and de- 
fcends weftwards, the Shadow of the oppofite Edge A B will mew the Hour from 12 to 6 
in the Evening. If you have a mind to have the Halves and Quarters of Hours, you need 
but double or quadruple the Divifions. 

Small Dials of this kind have Companies belonging to them, that fo the Dials may be ki 
North and South. 

The Conjlrutlion and Ufe of the Vertical Cylinder. 

This is a vertical Dial drawn upon the Superficies of a Cylinder by means of a Table of 
the Sun's Altitude above the Horizon at every Hour, when he enters into every 10th De- 
gree of the Signs, according to the Latitude of the Place for which the Dial is to be drawn j 
and for this end the following Table is calculated for 49 Degrees of Latitude.

We now proceed to fhew the Confiruclion of the of or ef aid Dial upon a Plane which afterwards 
may be made Cylindrical, or wrapped round a Cylinder ; or this Dial may be made upon the 
Surface of a Cylinder itfelf if the Lines be drawn thereon as upon a Plane. 

Fig. i 4 . Defcribe the Right-angled Parallelogram A B C D upon a brafs Plate or Sheet of Paper, 

whofe Breadth A B or CD let be nearly equal to the Circumference of the Cylinder it is to 
be wrapped round, and prolong the Line A B, upon which afiume A E for the Length of 
the Style, which mail determine the Length of the Cylinder. Then about the Point E, as 
a Center, with the Radius E A, make a circular Arc equal to the Sun's Meridian Altitude at 
his entrance into Cancer, and draw the occult Line E D, determining the Length or Height 
ef the Cylinder AD -, but if this length was given, and the Length of the Style required, 
you muft delcribe an Arc about the Point D, equal to the Complement of the Sun's great- 
eft Meridian Altitude, which, if the greateft Altitude be 64 Deg. 30 Min. will be 25 Deg. 
30 Min. and draw the occult Line DE&gt; which fhall determine the Length of the Style E A, 
proportioned to the Length of the Cylinder. 

This being done, divide the Arc A F into Degrees and Minutes, and draw occult Lines 
thro' each of the Points of Divifion, from the Center E to tiie Line A D, that fo this Line 

way 



Chap. 5* of Sun-Dials. 241 

rtiay be made a Scale of Tangents. But this Line may be otherwife divided, by fuppofing 
the Radius AE ioo or iooo equal Parts, according to the Length of the Cylinder, 
and taking the correfpondent Tangents from printed Tables, and laying them off 
from A. 

Things being thus ordered, divide the Sides A B, DC, into 6 equal Parts, and join the 
points of Divifion by five parallel right Lines, which will reprefent the beginnings of the 
twelve Signs ; then trifect each of thefe parallel Spaces for the ioth and 20th Degree of each 
Sign. Now by this means the Beginnings of the Months may be fet upon your Dial, be- 
caufe there will be no fenfible Error in fixing the Sun's Entrance into every Sign the 20th 
Day of every Month (N. S.). Then to prick down the Hour-Points upon all thefe Lines 
one after another, you muft ufe the foregoing Table : for example, to prick down the Houi- 
Point of 10 in the Morning, or 2 in the Afternoon, upon the Line A D reprefenting the 
Summer Tropick, you will find by the Table, that the Sun's Altitude at the Time of the 
Summer Solftice at the Hours of 10 or 2, is §5 Deg. 19 Min. therefore you muft take the 
Tangent of 55 Deg. 19 Min. from your Scale of Altitudes A D, and lay off from the 
Side A B upon the faid Tropick, and then you will have a Point therein thro' which the 
propofed Hour-Line mufl pafs. Again, To prick down the Hour- Point of the faid Hour 
of 2 upon another Parallel, fuppofe on that of the ill Degree of Leo or Gemini, you will 
find by the Table that the Sun's Altitude will then be 52 Deg. 34 Min. and the Tangent of 
thefe Degrees being taken from the Scale of Altitudes A D, and laid off upon the faid Pa- 
rallel from A B, will give a Point therein thro' which the Hour-Line of 2 muft pafs. And 
if you proceed in this manner, and find Points in the other Parallels, and likewife on their 
Divifions of every ioth and 20th Degree •, thefe Points joined will give the curved Hour- 
Line of 10 in the Morning, or 2 in the Afternoon. 

And thus likewife may be found Points in the Parallels thro' which the other Hour- 
Lines muft pafs •, which being done, you muft join all thofe belonging to the fame Hour by 
an even Hand, and mark the Characters of the Signs, the firft Letters of the Months, as 
likewife the Hour-Figures* each in their refpective Places, as per Figure, and your Dial 
will be finifhed; which afterwards muft be wrapped about the Cylinder, or bent Cy- 
lindrically, fo that the Lines reprefenting the two Tropicks be parallel between them- 
felves. 

The Style is fattened to a Chapiter ferving as an Ornament, and muft be moveable on the&gt; 
Line A B, that fo it may be placed at right Angles on the Degree of the Sign or Day of the 
Month. This Dial being placed upright, or hung by a Ring, turn it to the Sun, fo that 
the Shadow of the Style may fall down right upon the Parallel of the Day you defire to know 
the Hour in, and then the Extremity thereof will fhew the Hour or Part. 

The Sun's Altitude may be (hewn likewife by this Inftrument thus : Put the Style uport 
the Scale of Altitudes, keeping the Cylinder fufpertded or horizontally placed, and turn it 
about fo that the Style be towards the Sun •, then the Shadow of the Extremity thereof fhall 
ihew the Sun's Altitude above the Horizon. 

The abovefaid Parallelogram may ferve likewife as a Dial, without being wrapped round 
a Cylinder, or turned up cylindrically, if the Style be fo adjufted as to Aide along the 
Line A B, that fo it may be fet over the Day of the Month, or Parallel of the Sign the Sun 
is in. This is eafily done, in making a little Slit along the Top of the Plate, and flatting the 
Foot of the Style, fo that it may Hide in the faid Slit without varying it's Length. Now if 
this Parallelogram be placed upright, and the Line AB level (which may be eafily done by 
means of a Plumb-Line faftened to one of the Sides), and you hold it thus in your hand, 
or fufpend it by a Ring, fo that it be directly expofed to the Sun, and the Shadow of the 
Style falls upon the Parallel of the Sign or Month \ then the Extremity of the Shadow of the 
faid Style will fall upon the Hour. 

'The Conftrufiion and Ufe of a Dial drawn on a Quadrant. 

This Figure reprefents a Portable Dial drawn on a Quadrant, whofe Conftruction we have Fig. t, 
thought fit to lay down here, fince it is made, as well as the Cylindrical Dial, by means 
ol a Table of the Sun's Altitude calculated for the Latitude of the Place the Dial is made 
for. 

Firft, Divide the Limb B C of the Quadrant into Degrees, and about the Center A 
defcribe another Arc R S, reprefenting the Tropick of *s. Likewife divide the Radius 
A B nearly into 3 equal Parts, and with the Diftance A D draw a circular Arc for the 
Tropick of Yf ; divide the Space B D into 6 equal Parts, and defcribe the like Number 
of circular Arcs about the Center A, which fhall reprefent the Parallels of the other Signs, 
as they are denoted on the Side A C of the Quadrant. The next thing to be done, is to 
draw the Hour-Lines. Let it be required (for Example) to find a Point in the Tropick of 
2s thro' which the Hour-Line of 12 muft pafs : By the above pofited Table, the Sun's Al- 
titude (at Paris) at the faid Time is 64 Deg. 29 Min. therefore take a Thread, or Ruler 
faftened to the Center A, and extend it to that Number of Degrees and Minutes on the 
Limb of the Quadrant, and where the Thread or Edge of the Ruler cuts the Tropick of 
ss, will be one Point thro' which the Hour-Line of 12 muft be drawn. Then feek the 

Q^q q Sun's 



242 ^he ConftruBion and Vfes Book VIII. 

Sun's Altitude when he enters into n, which being found 61 Deg. 12 Min. lay the Thread 
over 61 Deg. 12 Min. on the Limb, and where it cuts the Parallel of ii, make a Mark for a 
Point in the faid Parallel thro' which the Hour-Line of 12 muft pafs. And if you proceed 
in this manner, Points may be found in the Parallels, or their Parts (if the Quadrant be big 
enough), thro' which the Hour-Line of 12 muft pafs, as likewife all the other Hour-Lines j 
and if the Points be joined, the curve Hour-Lines will be had, and the Dial will be finifhed, 
when there are two Sights fixed upon the Side A C. 

The Ufe of this Quadrant. 
Direct the Plane of the Inftrument towards the Sun in fueh manner, that his Rays may 
pafs thro' the Holes of the Sights G G, and then the Plumb-Line freely playing, will Ihew 
the Time of Day by interfering the Parallel that the Sun is in. But if you put a little 
Bead or Pin's Head upon the Plumb-Line, then you may extend the Thread from the 
Center, and Aide the Bead thereon, and fix it over the Degree of the Sign or Day of the 
Month, and holding up the Quadrant, as before, the Bead will fall upon the Hour of the 
Day. 

The Conflruclion and Ufe of a Particular right-lined Dial. 

Fig. 1 j, This Dial, which we call Particular, becaufe it ferves but for one determinate Latitude, 

is made upon a very even Plate of Brafs, or other Metal, about the bignefs of a playing 
Card. The Conftruction thereof is thus: Firft, draw the two right Lines A B, CD, crof- 
fing one another at right Angles in the Point E, about which, as a Center, with the Ra- 
dius E C defcribe the Circle C B D, and divide it into 24 equal Parts, beginning from the 
Point D ; then thro' each two Divifions thereof equally diftant from the Points C and D, 
draw parallel right Lines, which will be the Hour-Lines, whereof D R is that of 12, BE 
that of 6, and C M that of Midnight. This being done, form the right-angled Parallelo- 
gram P M Q^R, and draw the occult Line D R, making an Angle with C D equal to the 
Elevation of the Pole, viz. 49 Deg. This Line fhall reprefent the Radius of the Equi- 
noctial, and by means thereof the Trigon of Signs muft be formed, having D for it's Ver- 
tex. In order for this, produce the Hour-Line of the Sun's rifing in the longeft Day of 
Summer, which here is the Hour-Line of 4 •, as likewife the Hour-Line of 6, until it meets 
the Radius of the Equinoctial Circle DR ; then the Point in the Radius of the Equinoctial 
cut by the Hour-Line of 6, will be the Center of a Circle, whofe Diameter mail be perpen- 
dicular to the faid Radius, and is terminated by the Interferon of the Hour-Line of 4 
therewith. This Circle being defcribed, divide the Circumference thereof into 12 equal 
Parts, in order to form the Trigon of Signs, as is before explained in the third Chapter of 
this Book. Note* The two Tropicks will be at the Extremities of the faid Diameter, each 
making an Angle of 23 Deg. 30 Min. with the Radius of the Equinoctial, the Vertex 
being the Point D. Now the next thing to be done, muft be to make a little Slit along 
the Radius of the Equinoctial, that fo a little Slider or Curfor may Hide along it, having a 
little Hole drilled thro' it for fattening a Thread and Plummet with a Bead or Pin's 
Head on the Thread. And after this, we place two Sights on the Extremities of the 
Line P Q^ 

The Ufe of this Dial. 

Slide the Curfor, and fix the Hole in which the Thread is fattened over the Degree of 
the Sign the Sun is in, or the Day of the Month •, then flip the Bead or Pin's-head along 
the Thread, until it be upon the Hour-Line of 12. This being done, hold up your In- 
ftrument, lifting it higher or lower 'till the Sun fliines thro' the Holes of the Sights R and S, 
and the Thread freely plays upon the Plane thereof ; then the Bead will fall upon the Hour 
of the Day. 

The Conflruclion of an Univerfal right-lined Dial. 

jff g- , 6 This right-lined Dial, which ferves for all Latitudes, is made of a bignefs at pleafure, 

upon a very even Plate of Brafs or other folid Matter. The Construction of it is thus : 
Draw the Lines A B, CD, cutting each other at right Angles in the Point E, about 
which, as a Center, defcribe the Quadrant A F, which divide into 90 Deg. and with the 
Point E for the Vertex, make a Trigon of Signs according to the Method explained in 
Chap. 2. Divide each Sign into 3 Parts, each being 10 Deg. and fet the htft Letters of the 
Months to the Places correfponding to them, by fuppofing (as we have already) that the 
Sun's Entrance into every Sign is the 20th Day of the Month (N. S.) ; for Example, his 
Entrance into r the 20th of March, his Entrance into s the 20th of April* &amp;c This 
may be without any fenfible Error in fo fmall an Inftrument. Now draw dotted Lines 
from the Center E thro' the Divifions of the Quadrant A F, to the Line A G, which will 
divide it into Points, from which Parallels muft be drawn to the Line A B, which fhall be 
the different Latitudes or Elevations of the Pole, which muft be only marked between the 
two Tropicks, as you fee in the Figure, wherein they aic drawn ro every 5th Deg. On both 
fides the Point B lay off upon the Line B H, the Divifions that the Radii of the Signs of 

the 



H3 



Chap. 5. of Sun-Dials* 

the Trigon make dn the Line a a, reprefenting the Latitude oF 45 Deg. that fo the Repre- 
{entation of another Zodlack may be made upon the Line B H. 

Now the manner of drawing the Hour-Lines upon this Dial is thus : Draw Lines thro* 
every 15th Deg. of the Quadrant A F, parallel to ED, which is the Hour-Line of 6- 
and thefe Parallels will be the Hour-Lines from 6 in the Evening to 6 in the Mornino- A L 
being the Hour-Line of Midnight. And if the parallel Spaces, be laid off on th? other 
fide of the Hour-Line of 6, you will have the Hour-Lines from 6 in the Morning to 6 in 
the Evening. And for drawing the half Hours, divide each 15th Deg. of the Quadrant 
A F into half, and draw Parallel Lines between the Hour-Lines. 

The Hour-Lines may be yet otherwife drawn, by means of a Circle, whofe Diameter is 
the Line A B, and whofe Circumference is divided into 24 equal Parts for the 24 Hours of 
the Day, or into 48, for the Half-Hours. For then if right Lines be drawn thro' the op- 
pofite Points of Divifion, parallel to E D, we fhall have the Hour-Lines, and thofe of the 
Half-Hours, as we have faid in the Conftruction of the former right-lined Dial. 

About the Point I, as a Center, draw an occult Quadrant, which divide into 90 Deg. and 
laying a Ruler to the Center I, and on each Divifion mark the fame Degrees upon the Sides 
G Q, and G S of the Inftrument. Note, By means of thefe Divifions we may find the Sun's 
Altitude above the Horizon, as we fhall fhew by and by. R R are two Sights fixed on the 
Side G H. And the Piece K is a fmall Arm or Index, made of 3 Blades of Brafs, fo join- 
ed to each other by headed Rivets, that they may have a Motion either to the right or left i 
at the fharp end of this Ann is made a very little Hole, thro' which goes a Thread with a 
Plummet at the end thereof, and a little Bead or Pin's Head thereon. This little Arm 
is faftened to the Inftrument with a headed Rivet, that fo it may have a Motion at the 
Place K. 

The Ufe of this Dial. 

If the Hour of the Day be to be found by this Inftrument, you muft adjuft the End a of 
the Index on the Interfection of the Line of the Latitude of the Place, and the Degree of 
.the Sign the Sun is in, or the Day of the Month ; then extend the Thread, and flide the 
Bead to the fame Degree of the Sign in the little Zodiack, drawn on the Hour-Line of 12 
B I. This being done, hold the Inftrument up until the Sun fhines thro' the Sights R R, 
and the Thread freely playing upon the Plane of the Inftrument, the Bead will fall upon the 
Hour of the Day. 

If the Time of the Sun's rifing and fetting in all the Signs of the Zodiack for the Latitudes 
denoted upon the Inftrument be required, fix the End a of the Index on the Interfection of 
the Line of the Latitude of the Place, and the Degree of the Sign the Sun is in ; then the 
Thread freely falling parallel to the Hour-Lines, will fhew the Hour of the rifing and fet- 
ting of the Sun. For Example, The End of the Index being fixed on the Interfection of 
the Sign of s*, and the Line of the Latitude of 49 Deg. the Thread will fall along the 
Hour-Line of 4 in the Morning, or 8 in the Evening : and this fhews, that about the eoth 
of June, (N. S.) the Sun rifes at Paris, at 4 in the Morning, and fets at 8 in the Evening, 
and fo of others. 

The Elevation of the Pole is found thus : Place the End of the Index on the Point I, and 
raife or lower the Inftrument until the Sun's Rays pafs thro' the Holes of the Sights ♦, then 
the Thread freely playing, will fhew the Sun's Altitude upon* the Degrees on the fide OS 
or Q^G. 

All thefe kinds of Dials, that fhew the Hour of the Day by the Sun's Altitude, are con- 
venient in this, that they fhew the Time of Day without a Compafs ; but their common 
Imperfection is, that about Noon the Hour cannot be exactly determined by them, unlefs 
by feveral Obfervations to know whether the Sun increafes or decreafes in Altitude, and con- 
fequently whether it is before or after Noon. 

The Conftruttion of an horizontal Dial for feveral Latitudes. 

This Dial, which is made upon a very even and fmooth Plate of Brafs, or other folid Plate 24, 
Matter, hath a little Piece of Brafs in form of a Bird, the lower part of which is ad- Fig. 1. 
jufted in two little knuckles, that fo it may be rendered moveable, and lie down upon the 
Plane of the Dial. This Bird is kept upright by means of a Spring that is underneath the 
Dial-Plate, which going thro' a little fquare Hole in the Plate, keeps the Bird firm upon it's 
Foot. There is a Style or Axis going into the Bird, which is double, the lower End. of 
which goes into a little Knuckle at the Center of the Dial, that fo the faid Style may be 
raifed or lowered, according to the Latitude. There is on the Style a circular Arc, where- 
on the Degrees are fet down from 35 or 40 to 60. There is a Slit made along this divided 
Arc, paffing by the Eye of the Bird, that fo it's Bill may be fet to the Degree of the Pole's 
Elevation, and fixed there. The Dial-Plate is hollowed in circular, that fo a Compafs 
may be added thereto, faftened underneath by two Screws. The Needle and the Glafs 
covering it, are placed in the fame manner as in other Compaffes, of which we Have al- 
ready fpoken. 

The 



2A± The ConflrucJion and Ufes Book VlIL 

The Surface of this Dial is divided into 4 or 5 Circumferences for the like Number of 
different Latitudes, according to fome one of the Methods before laid down for diawirtg 
of horizontal Dials, whereof that by the Calculation of Angles is molt in ufe for fucli 
fmall Dials as thefe. They may be drawn alfo by means of a Plat-form, upon which are 
feveral Dials divided by the Rules before given. But this is well known to the Inftrument- 
Maker. 

The outmoft Circumference, which is divided for 55 Deg. of Latitude, may well enough 
ferve for thofe Places contained between the 58th and 53d Deg. of Latitude. The fecond, 
which is divided for 50 Deg. of Latitude, may ferve for Places contained between the 53d 
and the 47th Deg. of Latitude. The third, which is divided for 45 Deg. may ferve for 
Places between the 47th and 42d Deg. And the fourth, which is divided for 40 Deg. ferves 
for Places contained between the 42d and 38 th Deg. of Latitude. 

When a 5th Dial is drawn upon the Plate for the Latitude of 35 Deg. this ferves for all 
Places contained between the 37th and the 3 2d Deg. of Latitude. Now by means of a 
good Map of the World, or Globe, you may fee at what Places thefe Dials will be in ufe -, for 
that which is made for one Latitude, will ferve for all Places round about the Earth, having 
the fame North and South Latitude. We commonly grave underneath the Dial a Table of 
the principal Cities of the World with their Latitudes and Longitudes •, that fo the conve- 
nient Circumference on the Plate may be chofe, and the Axis of the Dial raifed to the proper 
Elevation of the Pole. 

The Ufe of this Dial. 

To find the Hour of the Day, raife or lower the Style, fo that the End of the Bill of the 
little Bird may anfwer to the Degree of the Elevation of the Pole marked on the Style, as 
at Paris againft the 49th Degree. The Style being thus raifed, place the Dial parallel to the 
Horizon, that is, level, and turn it fo to the Sun 'till the North Point of the Needle ufually 
marked with a little Ring, fixes itfelf ovef the Line of Declination, whereon is a Flower-de- 
luce&gt; and North is writ. Then the Shadow of the Style will fhew the Hour of the Day up- 
on the Circumference divided for the Latitude of the Place. You muft take care not to fee 
the Dial near Iron, for this changes the Direction of the Needle. 

'The Confiruftion of a Ring Dial. 

Fig. 2. Take a very round Ring of Brafs, or other folid Matter, about two Inches in Diameter, 

Four or five Lines in breadth, and of a convenient Thicknefs, and affume the Point A at 
pleafure thereon (whereat there is a little Hole), about which, as a Center, defcribe a Qua- 
drant ADC, which divide into 90 Degrees. Then find the Sun's Altitudes in the foregoing 
Table at every Hour when he is in the Equinoctial for the Latitude of Paris, and laying a 
Ruler from the Center A thro' thofe Altitudes affumed on the Quadrant, you may draw 
Lines which will divide the concave Surface of the Ring into rhe Hour-Points. Now this 
Dial will be very good for the Times of the Equinox, it being fufpended by the Ring B, fo 
that the Line A D is upright. 

But one of thefe Dials may be made for fhewing the Hour of the Day at any other time 
of the Year, if the Hole A be made moveable. For doing which, make the Arcs A E, 
A I, 23 Deg. for the Signs «, T T, m, and x •, A F, A K, 40 Deg. 26 Min. for the Signs 
h, ft, ~, and t -, and the Arcs AG, A L, 47 Deg. for the Signs es and kf. (The rea- 
fon why we affume thefe Arcs double, is, becaufe Angles at the Circumference are but half 
thofe at the Center.) Now by this means we fhall have a Kind of Zodiack upon the convex 
Surface of the Ring, whereon muft be marked the Signs in their proper Places, or elfe the 
firft Letters of the Months, that fo the Hole A may be put to the Degree of the Sign, or 
the Day of the Month. 

You muft defcribe likewife 7 Circles in the concave Surface of the Ring, whereof that in 
the Middle will be for the Equinoctial, and the others for the other Parallels. This being 
done, about the Points A, E, F, G, I, K, L, as fo many Centers, defcribe Quadrants of 
90 Deg. upon which Quadrants affume the Altitudes of the Sun every Hour when he is in 
every of the Signs, and produce the Radii drawn from the Centers to the Points of Affump- 
tion, until they cut the Circumferences in the concave Part of the Ring, and you will have 
Points thereon for the Hour-Lines, which muft be joined. 

Note, Thefe Divifions may be feparately drawn, and afterwards transferred on the 
Ring. 

The Ufe of this Dial. 

Place the moveable Hole at the Degree of the Sign wherein the Sun is ; then holding the 
Ring fufpended, turn it towards the Sun, fo that his Rays paffing thro' the Hole A, may 
fall upon the convenient Circumference of the Sign in the concave Part of the Ring, and then 
you will have the Hour of the Day fhewn.

To defcrifa the Hour- Lines upon another fort of Ring. 

The fourth Figure reprefents th'13 Ring compleat, and the Parallelogram ABCD, repre* Fig. 3, 
Tents it laid open or ftrctched upon a Plane, chat fo the Hour-Lines may be pricked down 
thereon before it be turned up circularly. 

This Ring is made of a blade of Brafs, or other folid Matter, being in length proportion- Fig. 4. 
able to the Bignefs you would have the Ring, and at leaft 4 or 5 Lines broad, with a pro- 
portionable Thicknefs, and whofe Extremes AC, B D, are cut at right Angles. About 
the Points C and D defcribe two Quadrants A L, M B, and divide each of them into 9 
^ qual Parts •, and from each oppofite Divifion draw the Parallels of the Signs, whereof the 
Line C F D (hall be for v and ===, A E B for the two Tropicks, and the others for the other 
Si&lt;ms placed according to their order. Then bifect the Parallelogram A B C D by the Line 
E F, and draw the Line G H feparately equal to E B, that fo a Scale may be made thereof, 
which mull be divided into 9 equal Parts, each of which muft be fubdivided into 10 equal 
Parts more by little dots, and fo the faid Scale will be divided into 90 equal Parts, anfwer- 
ing to the 90 Dcg. of a Quadrant. This being done, take the Degrees of the Sun's Alti- 
tude from the above pofited Table of Altitudes, at every Hour when the Sun is in the Equi- 
nox, and the Solftice% for the Horizon of Paris. For example, When the Sun is in the ift 
Deg. of sz, his Meridian Altitude is 64 Deg. 29 Min. take 64 \ equal Parts from the Scale 
G H between your Compaffes, and lay them off upon the Brafs Blade both ways from E to 
the Points I and K, as like wife from the Point F to the Points L and M, and join the 
Points I L and K M, by right Lines : then take from the Table the Sun's Altitude at the 
Hours of 1 and 11, when he is in the Summer Solftice, viz. 61 Deg. 54 Min. which here 
may be taken for 62 Deg. and opening your Compaffes to the Extent of 62 equal Parts of 
the Scale, lay them off upon A B from K towards E, and you will have a Point of the 
Hour-Lines of 1 1 and 1 ; likewife take 41 equal Parts or Degrees, for the Sun's Meridian 
Altitude when he is in the Equinoctial, and lay them off from M to O, and from L to N, 
and the Points N and O are thofe thro' which the two Hour-Lines of 12 muft be drawn. 
Moreover, take 39 Deg. 20 Min. the Sun's Altitude when he is in the Equinox, at the Hours 
of 11 and 1, from the Scale, and lay them off from the faid Points M and L upon the faid 
Line C D, and you will have two Points in the Line C D, thro' which the Hour-Lines of 1 1 
and 1 muft be drawn. And in this manner may Points be found in this Line, thro' which 
the other Hour-Lines muft pafs. 

But now to find Points in the Line A B, or TrOpick of Capricorn? on this fide the Point E, 
♦hro' which the Hour-Lines muft be drawn, (for the Points of the fame Line, on the other 
fide of E, for the Tropick of Cancer may be found in the fame manner as the Points for the 
Hour-Line of 11 and 1 was) you muft take 17 4 Degrees, or equal Parts from the Scale, 
viz. the Sun's Meridian Altitude, when he is in the Tropick of Capricorn, and lay them off 
from I to P, and P will be the Point thro' which the Hour-Line of 12 muft pafs ; and fo 
may the Points be found thro' which the other Hour-Lines muft be drawn. Now if the 
Points found in the Lines A B, and C D, thro' which the Hour-Lines pafs, be joined by 
right Lines •, thefe right Lines will be the Hour-Lines. 

But if you have a mind to be exacter, you may take the Degrees of the Sun's Altitudes 
at every Hour when he enters, and is in each 10th and 20th Degree of every Sign, and then 
find Points on the refpective Parallels on the Dial thro' which the Hour-Lines muft be 
drawn, which will not be right Lines but Curves j and in this cafe the Dial will be 
exacter. 

Having drawn the Hour-Lines, you muft Number them on both fides the Lines A B, 
C D, and alfo fet down the Characters of the Signs, and the firft Letters of the Months, 
each in their proper Place. When this is done, you muft drill two little Holes in the Points 
R and S {viz. the middles of the Lines I L, K M) in a conical Figure, the greater Bafes 
being outmoft, that fo the Sun's Rays may better come thro' them ; afterwards round or 
turn up the faid Blade circularly, folder the Extremities A C, BD together, and place a 
Button, with a Ring in the middle of the Junction of the faid Extremities, fo that the 
whole Inftrument be in equilibria ; which that it may, you muft turn the outfide there- 
of. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument. 

Hold the Ring fufpended, and turn the Hole proper for the Time of Year towards the 
Sun, fo that his Rays may fall upon the Parallel of the Sign he is in, the Day wherein you 
ufe the Inftrument -, and then the Hour of the Day will be (hewn thereon by a bright Spot 
or Point of Light. 

Note, The Hole S is in ufe from the 20th of March, (N. S.) to the 2 2d of September, and 
the Hole R for the other fix Months. We likewife write upon the convex Superficies of 
the Ring near the little Holes, the 20th of March, and the 22d of September, as appears 
in Figure 3, and, laftly, obferve that thefe two laft -Djals are proper but for one La- 
titude.

The Conftruftion and Ufe of the unherfal Agronomical Ring-Did. 

Fig. 5. This Inftrument, vvhofe Ufe is to find the Hour of the Day in any part of the Earthy 

by a bright Spot of the Sun's Light, is made of Brafs or other Metal, and confifts of two 
Rings, or flat Circles turned both within fide and without. The Diameter of thefe Kings, 
which ought to be broad and thick proportionable to taeir bigneftes, are from two to fix 
Inches. The outward Ring A rtprefents the Meridian of any Place wherein one is, and 
there are two Divifions of 90 Degrees thereon, which are diametrically oppofite to each 
other, one whereof ferves from our North Pole to the Equator, and the other from the Equa- 
tor to the South Pole. 

The innermoft Ring reprefents the Equator, and ought to turn very exactly within the 
outward one, by means of two Pivots or Pins put into Holes made diametrically oppofite in 
the two Rings at the Points of the Hour of 12. 

There is a thin Riglet (called a Bridge) with a Curfor marked C, compofed of two little 
Pieces that Aide in an Aperture made along the Middle of the faid Bridge, and which are 
kept together by two fmall Screws. Thro' the Middle of this Curfor is a very little Hole 
drilled, that fo the Sun may mine thro' it. Now the Middle of the faid Bridge may be 
confidered as the Axis of the World, and the Extremities as the Poles of the World ; and 
there are drawn on one fide thereof the Signs of the Zouiack with their Characters, and on 
the other fide the Days and Names of the Months, or only their firft Letters, being placed 
according to the refpect they have to the Signs. The Signs are divided into every 10th 
or 5th Degree, according to their Declination, by means of a Trigon already divided, 
the Vertex of which, or Extremity of the Radius of the Equinoctial, being within fide the 
Equinoctial Circle, as at the Point F. The two Pieces D D which are fcrewed to the cuter- 
moll Ring, ferve to fupport the Bridge or Axis which is moveable round, and are fo ordered 
as that the innermoft Ring may lie exactly within the outermoft, and they both make as it 
were but one. The two Pieces E are alfo fcrewed on the outermoft Ring, and ferve as 
Props to keep the Equinoctial Circle or inward Ring at right Angles to the Meridian or 
outermoft Ring. 

We fhall not here repeat the manner of dividing the two Quadrants into Degrees, and 
the Equinoctial Circle into Hours, Halves, and Quarters, having iufficiently fpoken of this 
elfewhere. We fhall only add, that all the Divifions of the Equinoctial Circle muft be 
drawn upon the concave Side thereof, which may be done by means of a Piece of Steel 
turned up fquare, according to the Curvature of the Circle. 

Near the outward Edges, on each of the two flat Sides of the Meridian, is made a Groove 
for the Piece G to Aide therein, the Middle of which is bent inwards, that fo it may go 
into the laid Grooves. The two Sides of this Piece, which muft be well hammered that 
they may have a good Spring, are made flat, in order to prefs againft the convex Surface 
of the Meridian, that thereby the Piece G may be held fall on any Degree of Divifion of 
the Meridian. The Button thro' which the Ring of Sufpenfion H goes, is riveted to the 
Middle of the Piece G, fo that it may turn round very freely, and by this means the In- 
strument be very perpendicularly fufpended by the Ring H : for this is one of the principal 
things in which the Exactnefs of the Inftrument confifts. 

'The Ufe of the Agronomical Ring-Dial. 

Place the inort Line a on the Middle of the hanging Piece G over the Degree of the La- 
titude of the Place you are in upon the Meridian Circle, for example, over the 49th Deg. 
at Paris ; and then put the Line crofting the little Hole of the Curfor on the Bridge to the 
Degree of the Sign, or the Day of the Month you defire to know the Hour of the Day in. 
This being done, open the Inftrument fo that the two Rings or Circles be at right Angles 
to each other, and fufpend it by the Ring H, fo that the Axis of the Dial reprefented by the 
Middle of the Bridge be parallel to the Axis of the World. 

Turn the flat Side of the Bridge towards the Sun, fo that his Rays coming thro' the little 
Hole in the Middle of the Curfor, fall exactly on a Line drawn round the Middle of the 
concave Surface of the Equinoctial Circle, or innermoft Ring ; and then the bright Spot or 
luminous Point ftiews the Hour of the Day in the faid concave Surface of the Ring. 

Note, The Hour of 12 cannot be ftiewn by this Dial, becaufe the outermoft Circle or Ring 
being then in the Plane of the Meridian, it hinders the Sun's Rays from falling upon the in- 
nermoft or Equinoctial Circle. You muft obferve likewife, that when the Sun is in the Equi- 
noctial, you cannot then tell the Hour of the Day by this Dial, becaufe his Rays fall parallel 
to the Plane of the faid Equinoctial Circle. But this is but about one Hour every Day, and 
four Days in the Year. 

The ConflruRion and Ufe of a Ring- Dial with three Rings. 

Fig 6, Tins Inftrument differs from the precedent one in nothing but only a third Ring or 

Circle, carrying the Sun's Declination. The Ring A reprefents the Meridian of the Place 

you would ufe the Dial in ; the Ring B reprefents the h qu noctial Circle ; and the Ring D, 

which turns exactly within the faid Equinoctial Circle, produces the fame Effect, as the 

Bridg-e 



Chap. 5. of Sun-Dials* 247 

Bridge reprefenting the Axis of the World in the precedent Inftrument. The two Extre- 
mities of the Diameter of this laft Ring, or the two Points of the Circumference thereof, 
whereat it is faftened to the Meridian, anfwer to the two Poles of the World, On the op- 
pofite Parts D D of the Circumference of this Circle, is denoted a double Trigon of Signs, 
whofe Center is the Vertex wherein all the Radius's reunite, the Arcs of each of which are 
fubdivided into every 10th or 5th Degree, to which may be likewife fubjoined the Days of 
the correfpondent Months. 

The Index E is faftened to the Center of the innermoft Ringi having two Sights riveted 
to the Extremities thereof, each having a fmall Hole drilled therein, for the Sun's Rays to 
pafs thro'. Note, Dials compofed in this manner fhew the Hour of 12, becaufe the In- 
dex is without the Plane of the Meridian Circle : and when we make them large, as 
o or 10 Inches in Diameter, we divide the Equinoctial Circle into every 5th or every 2d 
.Minute. 

This Dial hath a Piece F like as the former Dial has, going into a Groove made on each 
fide the Meridian, to be did to the Latitude of the Place. We fometimes fet thefe Dials 
upon Pedeftals, nearly like thofe of Spheres, which are (lid to the Latitude ; and in this Cafe 
they are placed upon an horizontal Plain •, we likewife add CompafTes to them, by which 
means the Variation of the Needle may be exactly known. 

The Ufe of this Dial. 

Place the little Line in the middle of the hanging Piece F to the Latitude of the Place 
wherein you have a mind to know the Hour of the Day, and the fiducial Line of the In- 
dex on the Day of the Month, or Degree of the Sign the Sun is in. Then open the Equi- 
noctial Circle at tight Angles to the Meridian, and holding the Inftrument fufpended, raife 
or lower the innermoft Circle, fo that the Sun's Rays may go thro' the Holes of the two 
Sights ; then the Line which is drawn along the middle of the Convexity of the faid Circle, 
will fhew the Hour or Part drawn in the middle of the Concavity of the Equinoctial Circle, 
even at all times of the Day; 

This may likewife be done fomething more convenient, when the Inftrument is placed 
horizontally upon it's Pedeftal. 

The Conjlruclion of an univerfal inclined Horizontal, and an Equinoclial Dial. 

This Inftrument confifts of two Plates of Brafs, or other folid Matter, whereof the under- Fig. 7. 
one A is hollowed in about the Middle, to receive a Compafs faftened underneath with 
Screws. The Plate B is moveable by means of a ftrong Joint at the Plate C. Upon this 
Plate is drawn a horizontal Dial for fome Latitude greater than any one of thofe the Dial 
is to be ufeci in, and having a Style thereon proportionable to that Latitude ; for when the 
faid Plane B is raifed by means of the Quadrant, the horizontal Plane muft always have a 
lefs Latitude than that the Dial is made for, or otherwife the Axis of the Style will have an 
Elevation too little. 

Initead of the Quadrant D we generally place but only an Arc from the Equator to 60 
Degrees, which are numbered downwards, 60 being at the Bottom, and for this Latitude 
of 60 Deg. we commonly draw the aforefaid horizontal Dial. That Arc of 60 Deg. is 
faftened by two fmall Tenons, and may be laid down upon the Plate A, as likewife may 
the Style upon the Plate B, and both of thefe are kept upright by means of little Springs 
underneath the Plates. What remains of the Conftruction of this Dial, may be fupplied 
from the Figure thereof. 

"The Ufe of the inclined horizontal Dial. 

Raife the upper Plate B to the Degree of Latitude or Elevation of the Pole of the Place 
wherein you are, by means of the Graduations on the Quadrant D. Then if the Plane A 
be fet horizontal, fo that the Needle of the Compafs fettles itfelf over it's Line of Declina- 
tion, the Shadow of the Axis will fhew the Hour of the Day. Note., We grave the Names 
of feveral principal Cities, as likewife their Latitudes and Longitudes, underneath the two 
Plates, in order to avoid the Trouble of feeking them in Maps. 

After the abovefaid manner, equinoctial Dials are made Univerfal throughout the whole 
Earth •, but here we muft have a whole Quadrant. The upper Plate is commonly in form 
of a hollowed Circle, which we divide into 24 equal Parts, for the Hours, each of which 
we fubdivide into 4 equal Parts, for the Quarters j all thefe being drawn in the Concavity of 
the Circle. 

There is a Piece that goes thro' the Circle, carrying the right Style, which is kept faft in 
the middle of the Circle by means of a little Spring faftened underneath the Circle -, and by 
this means the right Style may be raifed above the faid Circle, and lowered underneath it. 
And when the equinoctial Dial is drawn, we ufe the little Piece F for a Style, placed in the 
Center of the Circle. Note, The upper part of the Dial fhews the Hour of the Day from 
the 22d of March, (N. S.) to the 2?.d of September, and the under part thereof the Hour of 
the Day, the other 6 Months of the Year. 

The

The Ufe of the equinoctial Dial. 

You muft place the Edge of the equinoctial Circle to the Degree of the Elevation of the 
Pole, by means of the Quadrant •, then if the Dial be fet North and South by means of the 
Compafs, the Shadow of the Style will fhew the Hour of the Day at all times of the Year, 
even when the Sun is in the Equinoctial, becaufe the Circle is hollowed in, 

The CoriftruEtion of an Azimuth Dial. 

Fig. 8. This Dial, which is commonfy made in the Bottom of a Compafs, is called an Azimuth 

Dial, becaufe it is made by means of the Azimuth's or Sun's Vertical Circles, upon a Plate 
of Brafs, or other folid Matter, parallel to the Horizon. Firft, draw the Line A B, repre- 
fenting the Meridian, upon which defcribe a Circle at pleafure, half of which we fhall only 
ufe here for drawing the Morning Hour-Lines, becaufe thofe of the Afternoon are drawn 
after the fame way. Divide this Circle into Degrees, beginning from the Point A, repre- 
fenting the North Pole. Then trifect the Semi-Diameter AC, and take AD equal to two 
thirds thereof, which muft be divided into 6 Parts, thro' each Point of Divifion •, about the 
Center C muft be drawn concentrick Arcs, reprefenting the Parallels of the Signs, the Arc 
H being the Summer Tropick, that neareft to the Center C the Winter Tropick, and each 
of the others for two Signs equally diftant from the Tropicks, as appears per Figure. 

The Parallels of the Signs may moreover be drawn, in defcribing a Semi-Circle upon the 
Line H D, which Semi-Circle being divided into 6 equal Parts, you muft let fall dotted Pa- 
rallels upon the Line H D •, thefe Parallels will divide the faid Line into unequal Parts, and 
if thro' the Points of Divifions Arcs be defcribed about the Center C, thefe Arcs will be the 
Parallels of the Signs at unequal Diftances from each other. 

Now for drawing the Hour-Lines, the following Table of the Sun's Azimuths muft be 
ufed •, for example, to prick down a Point in the Tropick of Cancer, thro' which the Hour- 
Line of 11 in the Morning muft be drawn, you will find the Sun's Azimuth will then be 
3oDeg. 17 Min. and when he is in the firft Degree of n, or laft of ft, his Azimuth at the 
fame Hour is 27 Deg. 58 Min. and fo of others. Therefore if a Ruler be laid on the Center 
C, and on the 30th Deg. and 27 Min. of the outward divided Limb, the Edge of the Ruler 
will cut the Parallel of se, in a Point thro' which the Hour-Line of 11 muft pafs : then 
keeping the Ruler to the Center, move it, and lay it over the 27th Deg. and 58th Min. of the 
outmoft Limb, and you will have a Point in the Parallel of u and ft. thro' which the Hour- 
Line of :i muft pafs ; and in this manner may Points be found in the other Parallels thro* 
which the Hour-Line of 1 1 muft pafs ; and alfo Points in all the Farallels thro' which the 
other Morning Flour-Lines muft pafs : each of which Points belonging to the fame Hours 
being joined, you will have the curved Hour-Lines on one fide of the Meridian. And to 
find the Points thro' which the Afternoon Hour-Lines muft pafs, take the Diftances of each 
Point in the Parallels from the Meridian, and transfer them on the fame Parallels continued 
out on the other fide of the Meridian, becaufe the Sun's Azimuth at any two Hours equally 
diftant on each fide the Meridian, is the fame. 

The Ufe of the Azimuth Dial. 

Turn the Side B towards the Sun, fo that the Shadow of the right Style planted in a Point 
without the Compafs, and parallel to the Line of Noon, may fall along the Meridian Line : 
then the Needle pointing exactly North and South, will fhew the Hour of the Day in the 
Interfc&amp;ion thereof with the Parallel of the Sign the Sun is in, upon condition that the 
Needle has no Variation. But fince the Needle varies now above 12 Degrees at Paris, you 
muft place the Style in the Point E over the Line of Declination or Variation K I, and adjuft 
the Shadow of the Style along the faid Line of Variation, and by this means the Error arifing 
from the Needle's Variation will be avoided.

The Conjiru&amp;ion and Ufe of the Analemmatick or Ecliptick Horizontal Dial 

This is called an Analemmatick Dial, becaufe it is made by means of the Analemma, 
which is the Projection or Reprefentation of the principal Circles of the Sphere upon a 
Plane. The 9th Figure is the Analemma ; and the 10th Figure reprefents the Dial compleat, 
which (hews the Hour of the Day without a Compafs. 

Now to project the Analemma ; upon a very even fmooth Plate of Brafs, draw the Lines Fig. 9, 
A B and C D, cutting each other at right Angles in the Point E, about which, as a Center, 
defcribe the Circle A C B D, reprefenting the Meridian, it's Diameter C D, the Horizon, 
and A B the prime Vertical. Then affume the Arc D F equal to the Elevation of the Pole, 
which here is 49 Dcg. and draw the Line E F reprefenting the Axis of the World ; likewife 
affume the Arc C G equal to the Height of the Equinoctial 41 Degrees, and draw the Line 
G E for the Equinoctial. Affume the Arcs G H, G I, each of 23 Deg. 30 Min. for the 
Sun's greateft Declination, and draw the Line H I cutting the Equinoctial in the Point Y, 
about which, as a Center, defcribe the Circle H L I K, or only half of it, which divide in- 
to 6 equal Parts, and thro' each Point of Divifion draw Parallels to the Equinoctial, which 
continue out to the Horizon ; then from the Sections made by the faid Parallels on the Me- 
ridian, let fall the Parallels M, N, O, and P to the Horizon, and from the Sections made 
by the faid Parallels on the Axis, let fall the indefinite Perpendiculars £ c , R b, Qji to the 
Horizon. This being done, take the DifTance E M between your CompafTes, with which 
fetting one Foot in N, with the other make a fmall Arc upon the Line Q^z, and with one 
Foot in O cut the Line R b with the other ; then, continually keeping the CompafTes opened 
to the Extent E M, fet one Foot in P, and cut the Line S t in the Point C. 

Now to conftruct the little Zodiack, take the Diftance $ C, and lay off from E towards 
A and B for the Tropicks of 25 and Jcf •, again, lay off the Diftance 46, from the Point E on 
one fide, for the Parallel of n, and on the other fide for the Parallel of ~ ; and finally, 
take the Diftance X a, for marking the Parallel of « on one fide, and that of X on the 
other, and then the little Zodiack may be formed, as per Figure. Now to prick down the* 
Hour-Points, you muft defcribe the Circle M T Z V about the Center E, with the Diftance 
E M, and divide the Circumference thereof into 24 equal Parts, as likewife the Circum- 
ference of the Meridian A C B D, and from each oppofite Point of Divifion in the Meridian 
draw ftrait Lines parallel to A B, and in the Circle M T Z V, ftrait Lines parallel to C D, 
and thro' the Tnterfections of thefe Lines that are neareft to the Meridian, draw lightly an 
Ellipfis from Point to Point, as you fee in the Figure. Thefe Points of Section will be the 
Hour-Points, thofe for the Morning being on the left, and thofe for the Afternoon on the 
right ; and to have the half and quarter Hour-Points, the two Circles A C B D, M T Z V, 
muft be divided into 96 equal Parts. 

Things being thus prepared, transfer all the Hour-Points on another Brafs Plate, and Fl 'g- lo &gt; 
form the Ellipfis B thereon, by lightly drawing Lines from Point to Point, and grave the pro- 
per Numbers upon it, as they are marked in the 10th Figure. Likewife transfer the Trigon 
of Signs upon the faid Plate, taking each of the Diftances between your CompafTes, the one 
after the other, fo that the Signs v and ^ be in the Line of the Hour of 6, and place the 
Characters of the Signs thereon, as alfo the firft Letters of the Months, each one in their 
order. When this is done, you muft adjuft a Curfor C fo as to flide along the middle of 
the Trigon. This Curfor carries the right Style D, which rifes and falls by means of two 
fmall Knuckles. 

On the other part of this Plate, is drawn an horizontal Dial according to the common 
Rules, for the fame Latitude the Analemma is made for, and we place the Style or Axis E 
thereon upon the Hour-Line of 12, which rifes, falls, and is kept upright by means of a 
fmall Spring underneath the Plate. 

The Ufe of this Dial. 

Set the Dial parallel to the Horizon, and put the Curfor with it's right Style upon the 
Day of the Month, or Sign the Sun is in j then turn the Inftrument until the fame Hour be 
fhewn upon the two Dials, which will be the Hour of the Day. If, for example, the Sha- 
dow of the Extremity of the right Style falls upon the nth Hour on the Analemmatick 
Dial, and at the fame time the Shadow of the Style of the horizontal Dial falls likewife up- 
on the 1 ith Hour, on the horizontal Dial ; then the true Hour of the Day will be that of 
11. The Conveniency of this Dial confifts in this, that the Hour of the Day may be found 
thereby without a meridian Line, or Compafs ; but then it muft be pretty large, to fhew 
the Hour exactly. 

The Conflruclion of an univerfal Polar, Eajl y and Weft Diah 

This Inftrument confifts of a very ftrait and fmooth circular Piece of Brafs, or other Fg. u. 
Metal, pretty thick, that fo it may preferve it's perpendicular Weight, as likewife that a 
Groove may be made round the Limb thereof, for a hanging-Piece to flide about the fame, 
like that on the aftronomical Ring.

o The Conjlrucflon and Ufes Book VIII. 

About the Center cf the faid circular Piece defcribe the Circumference of a Circle, which 
divide into twice 90 Degrees. Then draw a right Line from the 90th Deo rC e thro' the 
Center, representing the Equinoctial, near the Top of which afiume a Point at pleafure, thro' 
which draw a right Line perpendicular to the Equinoctial-Line, which fhall be the Hour- 
Line of 6. Then to have the other Hour-Lines, you mult lay off the anfwerable Tangents 
upon the Equinoctial-Line both ways from the Point therein of the Hour-Line of 6 ; as the 
Tangent of 15 Deg. for the Hour- Points of 5 and 7 ; the Tangent of 30 Deg. for 4 and 8 ; 
the Tangent of 45 Deg. for 3 and 9, &amp;c. and if Lines be drawn thro' thefe Points parallel. 
to the Hour-Line of 6, thefe will be the Hour-Lines •, and the Length of the right Style' 
muft be equal to the Radius or Tangent of 45 Deg. and muft be placed upright upon the 
Hour- Line of 6, at the Point wherein it cuts the Equinoctial-Line. 

At the Points C C, on the Hour-Line of 9 in the Morning, and 3 in the Afternoon, are 
adjufted two fmall Knuckles, in which is placed the Piece V, which may lie down upon the 
circular Piece, and hkewife ftand at right Angles to it. Upon this Piece are pricked down 
the Hour- Lines of a Polar Dial, from 9 in the Morning to 12, and from 12 to 3 in the Af- 
ternoon. We fhall not here repeat the manner of drawing thefe Hour-Lines, for we have 
fufficiently fpoken of this already, as likewife how to draw the Arcs of the Signs \ only ob- 
serve, that the Parallels of the Signs are divided into every 10th Deg. and the fir if. Letters 
of the Names of the Months are fet down in their proper Place. 

The Style B is adjufted to the circular Piece with a Joint, that fo it may be railed or lie 
flat upon the faid Piece •, but it muft be raifed fo that the Extremity thereof may be exactly 
over the Point in the Equinoctial-Line cut by the Hour-Line of 6, and the Diftance of the 
faid Extremity from this Point equal to the Diftance from the Hour- Line of 9 to the Hour- 
Line of 6. 

The Ufe of the faid Dial. 

If you have a mind to find the Hour of the Day before Noon, place the little Line on 
the middle of the hanging Piece L upon the Latitude of the Place-, on that Quadrant on the 
Right-hand of the Style B, raife the Style fo that the Extremity thereof be directly over the 
Interfection of the Equinoctial and the Hour-Line of 6, and it's Diftance from that Point of 
Interfection equal to the Diftance from the Hour-Line of 9 to the Hour-Line of 6. Then 
holding the Dial fufpendtd by it's Ring, expofe it to the Sun, fo that the Shadow of the 
Extremity of the Style falls upon the Day of the Month ; and you will have the Hour of 
the Day upon the Eaft or Polar Dial. But if the Hour of the Day be required in the After- 
noon, you muft put the hanging Piece on the Latitude of the Place upon the Quadrant on 
the left fide of the Style, and turn the Dial to the Sun fo that the Shadow of the Extremity 
of the Style falls on the Degree of the Sign or Day of the Month. Then you will have the 
Hour of the Day as before. 

Thus have I laid down the Conftruction and Ufes of Portable Dials, chiefly in ufe, which 
may be fet North and South, without a Compafs or Meridian Line. But before I clofe this 
Chapter, I fhall briefly defcribe ibme other Portable Dials, which are curious enough, but 
are fomething difficult to make. 

The firft of thefe is a horizontal Dial of 2 or 3 Inches fquare, which we make of Brafs or 
any other folid Metal, for a given Latitude, and whofe Axis fhewing the Hour, is a Thread 
fattened at one end to the Center of the faid Dial, and the other end of which is hung to 
the top of a pretty thick Brafs Blade, placed at the Extremity of the Dial near the Hour- 
Line of 12. This Blade may lie down upon the Plarie of the Dial, and is kept upright by 
means of a Spring underneath the Dial ; and the Height of the Notch wherein the Thread 
lies above the Plane of the Dial, is equal to the Tangent of the Latitude. 

About a quarter of the Height of the faid Blade is adjufted thereon a Circle or Ring, 
proportioned to the bignefs of the Dial-Plate. This Ring is moveable by means of a Joint, 
and fo may lie down upon the Blade, and the Blade upon the horizontal Dial-Plane ; and 
when the Inftrument is ufing, there is a Prop to keep this Ring at the Height of the Equi- 
noctial, viz. 41 Deg. but when the Thread ferving for an Axis is extended, it muft exactly 
pafs thro' the Center of this Ring. 

The Concavity of the Ring is divided into Hours, Halves, and Quarters, as the equi- 
noctial Ring of the univerfal Ring-Dial is ; and there is a Bead or Pin's Head put upon the 
Thread, that fo it may be moved to the Sign the Sun is in, and ferve as aCurfor to fhewthe 
Hour of the Day in the middle of the Concavity of the Ring or Equinoctial. 

Now to place the Bead to the Sign or proper Month, you muft have a feparate Brafs Rig- 
let, having the Signs of the Zodiack, as alfo the Days of the Months drawn thereon in the 
manner they were drawn upon the Bridge of the univerfal Ring-Dial ; and having placed the 
laid Riglet from the Center of the horizontal Dial along the Thread or Axis, Aide the Bead 
to the Degree of the Sign the Sun is in, and then take away the Riglet, and fo will the Bead 
be placed for fhewing the Hour of the Day. 

On the backfide of the Blade is drawn an upright Line for a Plumb-Line to play on, that 
fo the Dial may be fet level. Note, This Dial may be rendered univerfal, if an Arc of a 
Circle divided into Degrees be adjufted behind the Bla^le by means of a Joint, fo as it 

may 



Chap. 6. of Sun-Dials. ^ x 

may-lie upon the Blade, and the Point whereon the Plumb-Line is hung by the Center of the 
faid Arc ; for then the Dial may be fet to the Latitude, by making the Plumb-Line fall upon 
the proper Degree on the circular Arc. It is proper alfo to obferve, that the Hours from 
eicrht in the Evening to four in the Morning may be taken away from the Equinoctial Ring, 
that fo this Dial may be of ufe at the Time of the Equinox. 

The Ufe of the aforefaid Dial 

Having placed the Bead to the Degree of the Sign the Sun is in, or Day of the Month, as 
before directed, expofe the Dial to the Sun, and turn it to the right or left until the Shadow 
of the Bead falls upon the fame Hour or Part, on the middle of the Concavity of the equi- 
noctial Ring, as the Shadow of the Thread or Axis does on the horizontal Dial ; and then 
that will be the true Time of the Day. 

We make feveral other portable Dials, as horizontal Aftrolabes, being Projections of the 
Sphere upon the Plane of the Horizon ; other Aftrolabes vertically uied by means of a 
Plumb-Line ; horizontal Dials made by means of the Sun's Altitudes, which are likewife 
fet North and South without a Compafs, and whereon the Signs are drawn by right 
Lines iffuing from the fame Center, and the Hour-Lines, curve Lines ; as likewife other 
portable Dials, which are curious enough, whofe Conftruction and Figures we referve for 
another time. 

Horizontal Dials whereon are drawn the Signs, as that of Fig. J. Plate 23. may like- 
wife be fet North and South without a Compafs, if the Dial be fo placed in the Sun, that 
the Shadow of the Extremity of the right Style falls upon the Degree of the Sign the Sun 
is in, or Day of the Month. But here there is this Inconveniency, that the Diftance of the 
Parallel of Cancer from the adjacent Parallels is fo fmall, that the Space of 10 Days there 
cannot be diftinguifhed. So that when we have done all we can, it is fcare pofiible to 
make a portable Dial that can fet North and South without a Compafs or Meridian Line, 
without falling into one of thefe Inconveniencies, either of having the Hour-Lines near 
Noon too nigh each other, or not exactly fhewing the Hour of the Day at the Time of the 
Solftices, becaufe of the fmall Difference that there is in the Sun's Elevations and Declination 
at thofe times. 



CHAP. VI. 

Of the ConflruSlion and Ufes of a Moon-Dial, a7id a NoBurnal 

or Star-Dial. 

Of the Conjlruclion of an horizontal Dial for fhewing the Hour of the Night by the Moon. 

THIS is called a Moon-Dial, becaufe by it you may tell in the Night by the Shadow Fig. 12, 
of the Moon, what Hour- Circle the Sun is in. It confifts of two Pieces or Plates of 
Brafs, or other folid Matter, of a bignefs at pleafure. The under-Plate H, is in figure of a 
Parallelogram, and the upper one A is circular, turns about the ffiadowed Space L, and the 
Center B, and has a horizontal Dial drawn upon it for the Latitude of the Place, according 
to the Rules before prefcribed for drawing horizontal Dials. The under Plate hath a Circle 
thereon divided into 30' unequal Parts, for the Days of a Lunar Month. Thefe Divifions 
are made thus •, let D E be the equinoctial Line by which the horizontal Dial was drawn, 
and F the Center of the equinoctial Circle (or the Center by which the equinoctial Line is 
divided.) About this Center defcribe a dotted Circle, and divide it into 30 equal Parts, or 
half of it into 15, and having laid the Edge of a Ruler on the Center F, lay it over each 
Point of the Divifions of the faid Circle one after another, and prick down Points upon the 
equinoctial Line ; then lay the Ruler to the Center B, and on each Point of Divifion of the 
equino&amp;ial Line, and divide the Circle H ; and when you have divided half of it, transfer 
the fame Divifions on the other Semi-Circle, and by this means the whole Circle will be di- 
vided into 30 unequal Parts for the 30 Days of a Lunar Month, about which Numbers 
muft be graved, as they appear per Figure. This being done, place the Axis B C anfwer- 
ing to the Elevation of the Pole, and difpofe it fo that when it is fet up it may not hinder the 
Hour-Plate from turning about the Center B. 

The Ufe of this Dial. 
The Moon's Age muft be found by an Ephemeris, or by the Epact, that fo the Point of 
the Hour-Line of 12 on the horizontal Dial may be applied to the Day of her Age in the 
Circle H of the under Plate. 

But before we go any further, you muft obferve, that the Moon by her proper Motion 
recedes Eaftwards from the Sun every Day about 48 Minutes of an Hour, that is, if the 
Moon is in Conjunction with the Sun on any Day upon the Meridian, the next Day fhe 

will 



252 The Coriflruaion and Ufes Book VIII. 

will crofs the Meridian about three quarters of an Hour and iotne Minutes later than the 
Sun : and this is the Reafon that the Lunar Days are longer than the Solar ones ; a Lunar 
Day being that Space of Time elapfed between her Paflage over the Meridian, and her next 
PalTage over the fame ; and thefe Days are very unequal on account of the Irregularities of 
the Moon's Motion. 

Now when the Moon is come to be in Oppofition to the Sun, flie will again be found in 
the fame Hour-Circle as the Sun is •, fo that if, for example, the Sun fhould be then in the Me- 
ridian of our Antipodes, the Moon would be in our Meridian, and confequently would fliew 
the fame Hour on our Sun-Dials as the Sun would, if it was above the Horizon. But this 
Conformity would be of fmall duration, becaufe of the Moon's retardation of about two 
Minutes every Hour. If moreover the Sun, at the Time of the Oppofition, be jult letting 
above our Horizon, the Moon being diametrically oppofite to it will he juft nfing, csV. and 
therefore to remedy the faid Retardation, we have divided the Circle H into 30 Parts. 

Now the Point of the Hour-Line of 12 on the horizontal Dial being put to the Moon's 
Age, as above directed, and the under- Plate fet North and South by means of a Compafs 
or meridian Line, the Shadow of the Style will fhew the Hour of the Night ; but to have 
the Hour more exact, you muft know whether it is the firft, fecond or third Quarter of 
the Moon's Day that you feek the Hour in, that fo the Point of the Hour-Line of 
12 may be fet againft a proportionable part of one of the 30 Spaces or Lunar Days of the 
Circle H. 

The Table on the under-Plate H, is ufed for finding the Hour of the Night by the Sha- 
dow of the Moon upon an ordinary Dial. To make this Table, draw 4 Parallel right Lines 
or Curves of any length, and divide the Space I I into twelve equal Parts for 12 Hours, and 
the two other Spaces K K into 15, for the 30 Lunar Days. 

The Ufe of this Table. 

Firft obferve what Hour the Shadow of the Moon fhews upon a Sun-Dial ; then find the 
Moon's Age, and feek the Hour correfpondent thereto in the Table, and add the Hour 
ihewn by the Sun-Dial thereto -, then their Sum, if it be lefs than 12, or elfe it's excefs above 
12, will be the true Hour of the Night. For example ; Suppofe the Hour fhewn upon the 
Sun-Dial by the Moon, be the 6th, and her Age be 5 or 20 Days, againft either of thefe 
Numbers in the Table you will find 4, which added to 6 makes 10, and fo the Hour of the 
Night will be 10. Again, Suppofe the Moon fhews the Hour of 9 upon the Sun-Dial, when 
(he is 10 or 25 Days old, againft 10 and 25 in the Table you will find 8, which added to 9, 
makes 17, from which 12 being taken, the Remainder 5 will be the true Hour fought. And 
fo of others. 

To find the Moon's Age, you muft firft find the Golden Number •, and this is done by 
adding 1 to the given Year, and dividing the Sum by 19, and the Remainder will be the 
Golden Number. Then you muft find the Epact, by means of the Golden Number •, and 
this is done thus : Divide the Golden Number by 3, and each Unit remaining being called 
10, will be the Epact, if the Sum be lefs than 30 ; but if above 30, 30 being taken from 
it, and the Remainder added to the Golden Number will be the Epact. The Epact being 
found, the Moon's Age may be had after this manner: If the Moon's Age be fough. in 
January, add o to the Epact •, in February, 2 ; in March, 1 ; in April, 2 ; in May, 3 ; in 
June, 4 ; in July, 5 ; in Augufi, 6 ; in September, 8 ; in October, 8 •, in November, 10 ; and 
in December, 10: and the Sum, if it be lefs than 30, or the Excefs above 30, added to the 
Day of the given Month (rejecting 30 if need be) will be the Moon's Age that Day. For 
example, To find the Moon's Age the 14th Day of March, in the Year 171 6, (O. S.) the 
Golden Number is 7, and the Epact 17 ; therefore adding 1 for March to 17, and the Sum 
will be 18 ; and if to this 18 be added 14 for the Day of the Month, the Sum will be 32, 
from which 30 being taken, and the Remainder 2 will be the Moon's Age. Note, This way 
of finding the Moon's Age is not fo exact as we have it by the Ephemeris. Likewife ob- 
ferve, that vertical Moon-Dials may be made in the manner as the horizontal ones are, but 
the Divifions of 30 Parts upon equinoctial Dials muft be equal, and the moveable Circle 
divided into 24 equal Parts, cifc. 

The Confiruclion of a Noclurnal or Star- Dial. 

The 13th Figure fhews the Difpofition of the chief Stars compofing the Conftellation of 
Urfa Major, and Urfa Minor, about the Pole and the Pole- Star. 

The Nocturnal we are going to mention, is made by the Confideration of the diurnal Mo- 
tion, that the two Stars of Urfa Major, called his Guards, or the bright Star of Urfa Minor, 
make about the Pole, or the Pole Star, which at prefent is but about 2 Deg. diftant from 
the North Pole. 

Now to conftruct this Inftrument, you muft firft know the right Afcenfion of the faid 
Stars, or in what Days of the Year they are found in the fame Hour Circle as the Sun is. 
This may be found, by Calculation, on a Globe, or a Celeftial Planifphere, by placing the 
Star in queftion under the Meridian, and examining what Degree of the Ecliptick will 
be found at the fame time under the Meridian. By this Method you will find that the 

bright 



Chap. 7. of Sun-Dials. 2,53 

bright Star or Guard of the Little Bear, was found twice in one Year with the Sun under 
the Meridian, viz. in the Year 1715, once the 8th of May, (N. S.) above the Pole, and 
again the 8th of November below the Pole. Therefore in the faid two Days of the Year, 
the abovementioned Star will be in all the Hour-Circles at the fame Time as the Sun is ; 
and confequently will fhew the fame Hour. You will find alfo, that the two Guards of 
Urfa Major were found two other Days of the Year under the fame Meridian or Hour- 
Circle as the Sun, viz. the firft Day of September below the Pole, and the firft Day of 
March above it. And in thefe two Days the faid Stars will fhew the fame Hours as the 
Sun does •, but becaufe the fixed Stars return to the Meridian every Day about r Deg. 
fooner than the Sun, or four Minutes of an Hour, which is two Hours per Month, it is 
this, which is to be obferved for having the Hour of the Sun, which is the Meafure of our 
Days. 

Thefe things being premifed, it will not be difficult to make a Nocturnal or Star-Dial, 
in the following manner : 

The Inftrument is compofed of two circular Plates applied on each other ; the greater of Fig- H« 
which, having a Handle for holding up the Inftrument when ufing, is about two Inches 
and a half in Diameter, and is divided into twelve Parts for the twelve Months of the Year, 
and each Month divided into every 5th Day ; fo that the middle of the Handle exactly anfwers 
to the Day of the Year wherein that Star which is ufed has the fame right Afcenfion as the 
Sun has. If, for example, This Inftrument be made for the two Guards of Urfa Major, the 
firft Day of September muff, be againft the middle of the Handle; and if it be made for the 
bright Star of Urfa Minor, the 8th Day of November muft be againft the middle of the 
Handle. Therefore if you will have the Inftrument ferve for both thefe Stars, the Handle 
muft be made moveable about the faid circular Plate, that fo it may be fixed according to 
neceffity •, and this is eafy to do by means of two little Screws. 

This being done, the upper lefTer Circle muft be divided into 24 equal Parts, or twice 12 
Hours, for the 24 Hours of the Day, and each Hour into Quarters, according to the Order 
appearing in the Figure. Thefe 24 Hours are diftinguifhed by a like Number of Teeth, 
whereof thole whereat the Hours of 12 are marked are longer than the others, that fo the 
Hours may be counted in the Night without a Light. 

In the Center of the two circular Plates is adjufted a long Index A, moveable about the 
fame upon the upper Plate. Thefe three Pieces, viz. the two Circles and the Index, are 
joined together by means of a headed Rivet, and pierced fo, that there is a round Hole thro' 
the Center about two Inches diameter, for eafy feeing the Pole-Star thro' it. Note, The Mo- 
tions of the upper-Plate and Index ought to be pretty ftiff, that fo they may remain where 
they are placed when the Inftrument is ufing. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument. 

Turn the upper circular Plate 'till the longeft Tooth whereat is marked 12 be againft the 
Day of the Month on the under Plate ; then bringing the Inftrument near your Eyes, hold 
it up by the Handle, fo that it leans neither to the Right or Left, with it's Plane as near 
parallel to the Equinoctial as you can ; and looking at the Pole-Star thro' the Hole in the 
Center of the Inftrument, turn the Index about, 'till, by the Edge coming from the Center, 
you can fee the bright Star, or Guard of the Little Bear, if the Inftrument be adapted for 
that Star, and that Tooth of the upper Circle that is under the Edge of the Index, is at the 
Hour of the Night upon the Edge of the Hour-Circle ; which may be known without a 
Light, by accounting the Teeth from the longeft, which is for the Hour of 12. 

You muft proceed in this manner for finding the Hour of the Night, when the Inftru- 
ment is made for the Guards of Urfa Major, which Stars are nearly in a right Line with the 
Pole-Star, are of the fame Magnitude, and are very ufeful for finding the Pole-Star.

CHAP. VJL 

Of the Conftruflion of a Water-Clock, 



THIS Clock is compofed of a Metalline well foldered Cylinder, or round Box B, Fig. 15. 
wherein is a certain Quantity of prepared Water, and feveral little Cells, which com- 
municate with each other by Holes near the Circumference, and which let no more Water 
run thro' them than is neceflary for making the Cylinder defcend flowly by it's proper Weight. 
This Cylinder is hung to the Points A A by two fine Cords of equal Thicknefs, which 
are wound about the Iron Axle-Tree D D, which Axle-Tree goes thro' the exact middle of 

T t t the 



2,54 ^ e Conftruclion and Ufes Book VIII. 

the Cylinder at right Angles to the Bafes, and as it defcends (hews the Hour marked upon 
a vertical Plane on both fides of the Cylinder. The Diviiions on this Plane are made thus: 
Having wound up the Cylinder to the top of the Plane from whence you would be^in the 
Hour-jJivifions, let it delcend 12 Hours, reckoned by a Clock or good Sun-Dial, and note 
the Place where the Axle-Tree is come to at the End of that Time, and divide the Space 
the Axle-Tree ha3 moved thro' in 12 equal Parts, each of which fet Numbers to, for the 
Hours. 

We make likewife Clocks of this kind, that fhew the Hour by a Hand turning about a 
Dial-Plate, as appears in the fame Figure. This is done by means of a Pulley four or five 
Inches in diameter, fattened behind the Dial-Plate on a Brafs or Steel Rod, going thro' the 
Center thereof; one End of this Rod goes into a little Hole for fupporting it, and at the 
other End is fixed the Hand (hewing the Hour. 

The faid Hand turns by means of a Cord put about the Pulley, one end of which fup- 
ports the Axle-Tree at the Place H, and at the other end is hung a fmall Weight F ; then as 
the Cylinder (lowly deicends, it caufes the Pulley to turn about, and confequently the Hand, 
which by this means (hews the Hour. 

The Circumference of the Pulley mult be equal to the Length the Axle-Tree of the Cy- 
linder moves thro' during twelve Hours •, and for this End you muft take that Length ex- 
actly with a String, and then make the Circumference of the Pulley equal to the Length of 
the String ; and fo the Pulley and Hand will go once round in twelve Hours. When the 
Cylinder defcends a little too fwift, and confequently the Hand moves too faft, then the 
Weight F muft be made heavier \ and when it defcends too flow, it muft be made lighter. 

The Confiruftion of the Cylinder or Round Box. 

Fig. 16. This Cylinder is fometimes made of beaten Silver, but commonly with Tin. The Dia- 

meter of each Bafe thereof is about 5 Inches, and the Height 2. 

The In fide of this Cylinder is divided into feven little Cells (and fometimes into five), as 
the Figure (hews. Thefe little Cells are made by foldering feven Silver or Tin inclined Planes 
to each Bafe, and the concave Circumference of the Cylinder; each of which are about 2 
Inches long, as BF, A L, EI, D H, CG. Thefe Cells have fuch an Inclination when they 
turn about, that they receive the Water thro' a little Hole in each Plane near the Circumfe- 
rence, and by this means let it run from one Cell to the other ; lb that as the Cylinder rolls, 
it defcends, and (hews the Hour upon a vertical Plane by the Extremity of the Axle-Tree, 
which (as we have faid) goes thro' the fquare Hole M in the middle of the Cylinder. Note, 
In a Cylinder of the abovefaid bignefs we ufually pour feven or eight Ounces of diftilled 
Water. But before the VVater be poured in, you muft take great care to well folder the in- 
clined Planes to the Bafes and Circumference. After this, the Water muft be poured thro' 
two Holes pofited on one and the fame Diameter, equally diftant from the Center M ; then 
thefe Holes muft be well (topped with foldering, that fo the Air may not get in, or the 
Water run out while the Cylinder is turning about. 

You may perceive, by the Figure, that the inclined Planes within the Cylinder do not join 
each other, but end in G, H, I, L, F, that fo when the Cylinder is winding up, the Water 
may run fwiftly from one Cell to the other, and the Cylinder remain at any Height one pleafes ; 
becaufe that at every Motion we give it when winding up, the Water running in a great 
Quantity thro' the Openings, the Cylinder will prefently aflume it's Equilibrium, which would 
not happen if the Cells were abfolutely inclofed : for the little Holes in the inclined Planes, 
are not fufficient for letting the Water run thro' them fo fwift as it ought, it going through 
them but by drops. 

It is manifeft, if this Cylinder was fufpended by the Center of Gravity thereof, as would 
happen if the Surface of the Axle- Tree mould exactly pafs thro' the Center of the faid Cy- 
linder, it would remain at reft ; and the Caufe of it's Motion is, that it is fufpended without 
the Center of Gravity by the Cord's going about the Axle-Tree, which ought not to be, with 
regard to the. bignefs of the Cylinder, and the Quantity of Water in it, but about one Line, 
or one Line and a half, in thicknefs. 

From what has been faid it is evident, that the Swiftnefs or Slownefs of the Motion of 
the Cylinder depends upon the Thicknefs of the Axle-Tree ; for the thicker the Axle-Tree is, 
the (lower will the Cylinder defcend, and contrariwife, becaufe it has more or lefs Excentri- 
city, and confequently the Water will run more or lefs fwift from one Cell to another; by 
which means the Force of it's Motion will be more or lefs ballanced by the Weight of the 
Water contained in the oppofite Cell. 

If you have a mind to fee the Circulation of the W T ater in one of thefe Cylinders, you may 
have one made that (hall have a Glafs Bafe ; but then it will be difficult to find a Matter that 
(ball make the inclined Planes (tick firm to this Glafs Cafe, and this to the Circumference oi 
the Cylinder. 

When the Cylinder is nearly defcended to the Bottom of the Cords, you mud raii'e it up 
with your Hand, making it turn at the fame time, fo that the Cords may equally roll all 
along the Axle-Tree, and that it be hung horizontally.

I have hinted before, that the Water poured into the Cylinder muft be diftilled, other- 
wife it muft be often changed, becaufe it makes a Slime about the fmall Holes thro' which it 
runs, which hinders it's running as it fhould do. 

CHAP. VIII. 

Of the ConflruSiion of an Inftrument^ Jhewing on what Point of the 
Compafs the Wind blows ^ without going out of ones Room. 

YOU muft affix to the Ceiling, Mantle-Tree, or Wall of a Room, a Circle divided into 
32 equal Parts, for the 32 Points of the Compafs, fo that the North and South Points 
thereof exactly anfwer to the meridian Line, which may be eafily done by a Compafs. Then 
there muft be a Hand made moveable about the faid Circle, and this Hand muft be turned 
about by an upright Axle-Tree, which may be turned round by the leaft Wind blowing 
againft the Fane at the Top thereof, above the Roof of the Houfe. 

But to explain this more fully, confult Fig. 17. The Wind turning the Fane AB (which Fig. 17. 
ought to be of Iron), fixed to the Top of the Axle- Tree C D, turns this Axle-Tree, which 
is placed upright, and fuftained towards the Top by the horizontal Plane E F, which is a 
Piece of Iron fattened to fome convenient Place for holding up the Axle-Tree. And at the 
Bottom of the faid Axle-Tree is placed a Steel Square G H, having a fhallow fmall Hole D 
nude therein for the Point of the Axle-Tree, which ought to be of tempered Steel for the Axle- 
Tree to ftand in, and move with the leaft Wind. The Pinion I K muft have 8 equal Teeth 
for the 8 principal Winds. The Teeth of this Pinion take into the Teeth of the Wheel 
ML, whole Number are 16 or 32, according to the Points denoted upon the Circle YZ; 
and fo this Wheel is turned about by the Fane, as alfo it's Axis P Q^, which being placed 
horizontally, goes thro' the Wall T at right Angles to it, as alfo to the Circte of Winds 
Y Z, fixed to the Wall. The Hand R fhewing which way the Wind blows, is fixed to the 
End of this Axle-Tree P Q^, and turns along with it ; and the Names of the Winds muft be 
diftinguifhed by Capital Letters, as on Compafs Cards. 

By the Difpofition of the whole Inftrument it is eafy to perceive, that when the Wind 
turns the Fane A B, this likewife turns the Axle- Tree C D, which at the fame Time turns 
the Pinion I K, and the Pinion 1 K the Wheel L M, and this the Axis QJ?, and Q^P the 
Hand. And fo you may fee which way the Wind blows, without going out of the Room. 




A fljorl Defcription of the principal Tools ufed in making 
of Mathematical Inftruments. 

TH E chief and moft neceffary Tool is a large Vice, ferving to hold Work while 
it is filing, &amp;c. It is neceffary that this Tool be well filed, that the Chops meet 
each other exactly, that they be cut like a File, be in good temperature, that the 
Screw be adjufted as it fhould be in it's Box ; and that the whole Tool be well fixed to. a 
Bench. There are alfo Hand-Vices of different bieneffes, according to the Work to be 
filed. 

The Anvil, which ferves for hammering Work upon, ought to be very fmooth and of 
tempered Steel, and placed upon a great wooden Billot, fo that it may not give way when 
it is working upon. 

There are alfo Bench- Anvils for ftrengthening and rivetting fmall Work ; fome of thefe, 
which are called Bee's, and ferve to make Ferrils upon, &amp;c. have one fide conical, and the 
other in figure of a fquare Pyramid. 

Hand-Saws are made fo as to have Branches drawing the Blades (which are of different 
bigneffes) ftraight by means of Screws and Nuts. 

It is neceffary to have good Files. The rough ones made in Germany are the beft ; and 
the fmooth and baftard Files of England are very good. There are alfo fmall rough and 
fmooth Files, for filing Work Triangular, Square, Circular, Semi-Circular, &amp;?f. Rafps for

2 z6 si Dejcriptio/i of the principal 'Tools 

fafbioning of Wood ; feveral forts of Hammers for firaightening, fmoothing, rivetting, &amp;e. 
of Work •, Tapes and Plates for making Screws. 

Pincers and Knippers of feveral kinds. SchTars of feveral Sizes for cutting of Metals. 
Burnifhing-Sticks for polifhing Work. Steel-Drills of divers bigneiles for making of Holes 
thro' Work, having one end filed like a C at's Tongue, and the other fharp. Thefe Drills arc 
ufed different ways - y for fome of them are placed in a drilling Leath, which is compofed of a 
fmall fquare Iron-Bar, and two little Poupets or Heads carrying a Pulley, wherein is placed 
the Drill in a fquare Hole going thro' it, which is turned by means of a little Cat-gut Row. 
Note, This Tool is placed in a Vice when it is ufing. Brafs or Wood may be drilled alio by 
putting it firft into the Vice, and the Drill in a Pulley. Then if the end of the Drill be put 
into a (hallow Cavity made in a Piece of Brafs or Iron, placed againft your Bread, and the 
Point thereof be put to the thing you would make a Hole thro' ; by turning the Drill fwiftly 
about by means of the Bow, and at the fame time prefiing it with your Bread: againft the 
thing to be drilled, you will foon make a Hole thro' it. 

The Leath is alfo of great ufe ; the mod fimple of them is made of two Brafs or Tron 
Poupets or Heads Aiding along a fquare Iron-Bar, and a Support which alfo Aides alono- the 
faid Bar, upon which the Tools are laid when they are ufing. At the Top of the Poupets 
are two Screws of tempered Steel going thro' them, which are fixed by means of Nuts. 
When this Leath is to be ufed, it muff, be placed in a Vice, and the thing to be turned, be- 
tween the two Points of the Screws j and if you have a mind to turn with your Hand, you 
muft ufe a Cat-gut Bow. 

Great Leaths for turning with one's Foot are compofed of two wooden Poupets, and 
two wooden fide Beams, of a Length and Breadth proportional to the bignefs of the 
Leath, which are fuftained by two Pieces of Wood called the Feet of the Leath. Thefe 
fide Beams are placed level, about two or three Inches diftant from each other, according 
to the bignefs of the Poupets put between them, and the ends of them are adjufled upon 
the Feet, which are about four Foot high, and they are likewife joined underneath 
by two or three crofs pieces of Wood, for rendering the Machine more ftable and 
folid. 

The Poupets, which are two pieces of Wood of equal Length and Thicknefs, have one 
part of each cut fo as to go in between the fide Beams •, and the other part, being the Head, 
is cut fquare, and folidly pofited upon the fide Beams •, and that they may be very firm, 
there are Clefts of Wood drove with a Mallet into Mortice- Holes at the Bottom of the Pou- 
pets underneath the fide Beams. 

In the Head of each Poupet is a tempered fteel Point ftrongly inclofed in the Wood -, fo 
that when thefe two Points are brought to each other, they may exactly touch. There is 
Jikewife a wooden Bar going all along, which is fuftained by the Arms of the Poupets, which 
may be lengthened and fhortened at pleafure ; and this ferves as a Reft for the Tools, when 
they are ufing. 

Againft the Ceiling, over the Leath, is fixed an Elaftick wooden Rod, having at the End 
thereof a Cord fattened, which comes down to the Ground, and is fixed to the End of a 
piece of Wood, called the Treader. 

Now when you have a mind to work, the Cord muft be put about the Piece to be turned, 
or about a Mandril adjufted to it ; and prefiing your Foot upon the Treader, you will turn 
the Work by means of the Rod which fprings ; then with proper Tools laid upon the Sup- 
port, and againft the Piece which is turning, you muft firft fafhion it with coarfe Tools, and 
finifh it with fine ones. 

Becaufe all Work cannot be turned between two Points, one of the Poupets muft be taken 
away, and inftead thereof muft be placed a Piece of Wood furnifhed with Iron, adjufted be- 
tween the fide Beams as the Poupets are, and inftead of having a Steel Point has a very- 
round Hole therein, in which goes the Colet of an Iron-Arbor, whofe other End is fuftained 
by the Steel Point of the other Poupet. 

The faid Arbor is fifteen or eighteen Inches long, and is compofed thus : at the End, 
which is fupported againft the aforefaid Piece of Wood, is a Screw of a very large Thread 
made round the Arbor, upon which are fcrewed on divers Brafs Boxes, in which are held fad 
the Pieces of Wood, which ferve to place the feveral Works to be turned. And at the other 
End of the faid Arbor are made feveral Threads of Screws of different bigneffes, that fo 
Screws may be turned. 

Near the middle of the faid Arbor, is placed a Mandril or wooden Pulley, about which goes 
a Cord. There may be feveral other Pieces adjufted on this Arbor, for turning irregular Fi- 
gures, as Ovals, Hearts, Rofes, wreathed Pillars, csV. All thefe Pieces are filed into the 
Figures that one would have them make, and have fquare Holes in the middle of them, 
which are adjufted to a Square near the End of the Arbor. 

When the Pieces are difpofed on the Arbor, the pointed End thereof is placed in a little 
Hole in the Steel Point of the Poupet, and the other End in the abovefaiu wooden Piece 
(placed inftead of a fecond Poupet), which is made fo, that there are two Pieces which 
fpring, and pufh the Figure backwards and forwards, and by this means move the 
Arbor backwards and forwards, more or lefs. according to the Figure ; and this is the

Caufe that the Tool gives the proper Figure to the Work, which moves to it, or recedes 
from it, according to the Motion of the Arbor ; for the Tool muft always be held faft upon 
the Support. But fmce thefe kinds of Figures are feldom ufed for Mathematical Inftruments, 
I ihall fay no more as to this way of turning. 

The principal Ufe of the faid Arbor, ferves for turning of Rings, making of Grooves 
in Compaffes, and other the like things. And -this may be done, in placing the Pieces to 
be turned upon the Wood belonging to the Boxes (of which we have already lpoken), which 
are adj lifted on the Leath for receiving the faid Pieces. Note, The Refts or Supports of the 
Tools are likewife placed according as the Work requires ; fome before, and fome fide- 
ways. 

Male and Female Screws are formed, by putting the proper Thread on the Arbor into a 
piece of Wood hollowed into a Screw of the fame Thread, which is placed at the Poupet 
carrying the End of the Arbor. And the other End of the Arbor, where is a Colet of the 
fame Thicknefs, is put exactly into the Hole of the abovementioned piece of Wood •, then if 
the Treader be put in motion by your Foot, the Work will move backwards and forwards, 
[o as that you may form a Screw or a Nut, with toothed Tools made on purpofe, according 
to the Thitads marked upon the Arbor. Note, For turning of Wood, Googes, Chiffels, 
&amp;V. are ufed. But for Brafs and other Metals, fmaller Tools of tempered Steel muft be 
ufed, as Graving-Tools, cjJV. 

Thus have I here, and in the Body of this Work, given a fliort Account of the Tools 
commonly ufed in making of Mathematical Inftruments. The others may be eafily fupplied 
according to Neceffity. But fince they are ufually made by thofe that ufe them, I fhall here 
(hew how to chufe the beft Metal for thtir Conftruction. 

The beft Steel comes from Germany. This ought to be without Flaws, Black- Veins, or 
Iron-Furrows. You may know this by breaking of it, and feeing whether the Grain be very 
fine and equal. 

In forging of Tools, or any thing elfe of Steel, you muft take care of over-heating them, 
and perform it as foon as poffible •, for the longer they are hot, the more will they be 
fpoiled. 

When the Tools are forged and filed, and you have a mind to temper them, you muft 
heat them led-hot 'till their Colour be fomething redder than a Cherry, and then they muft 
be tempered in Spring or "Well- Water : the colder the Water is, the better. And when they 
are cold, they muft be taken out of the Water, and laid prefently upon a Piece of hot Iron, 
fo long, 'till the Colour they have contracted by tempering is loft, and they become yellow- 
ifh ; and then they muft be thrown again into the Water, without flaying 'till they become 
blue, becaufe they will lofe their Force. 

To temper Bundles of Files, or other Pisces of Iron, you muft take Chimney-Soot, the 1 
oldeft and grofTeft being the beft, and having finely powdered it, temper it with Pifs and 
Vinegar, putting a little melted Salt therein, until the whole be as a liquid Pafte. The Soot 
being tempered, the Tools muft be covered over with it, and this covered with Earth, and 
the whole Bundle thrown into a ftrong Charcoal-fire ; and when it is become fomething red- 
der than a Cherry, it muft be taken out and thrown into a Veffel full of very cold Water, 
and then the Files will be fufficiently hard. 

We have already fhewed the manner of foldering Brafs or Silver to each other ; and We 
would have it here obferved, that Iron may be foldered to Iron, by putting thin Brafs upon 
the Piece to be foldered, and the Powder of Borax, and then covering it all round with 
Charcoal, and heating it until we perceive the Brafs melts and runs. 

Note, Brafs cannot be hammered when it is hot, for it will break •, but Copper is ham- 
mered cold or hot : but this is feldom ufed in making of Mathematical Inftruments, becaufe 
Brafs is finer and more convenient. Brafs is made with red Copper and Calamin, which is a 
Stone giving a yellow Tincture to the Metal, and is found in the Country of Liege, and in 
France. 

Gold and Silver may be hammered cold or hot, and may be melted alfo nearly as Brafs 
is ; and Mathematical Inftruments are made with Gold and Silver in the fame manner as with 
Brafs.

DEFINITION I. 

H E Path of a Vertex, is that Circle of the Earth which any Place or Vertex 
on it's Superficies defcribes, in the Space of twenty-four Hours, by the 
Earth's diurnal Revolution, 
rallel to the Equator. 



Whence the Paths of Vertices are Circles pa- 



DEFINITION II. 

If a Plane be conceived to touch the Moon's Orbit in that Point, wherein a Line connec- 
ting the Centers of the Earth and Sun interfects the faid Orbit, and Hands at right Angles 
to the aforenamed Line : And if an infinite Number of right Lines be fuppofed to pafs 
from the Center of the Sun, thro' this Plane to the Periphery of the Earth, to it's Axis, 
as likewife to the Axis of the Ecliptick, and the Path of any Vertex ; the faid Lines will 
orthographically project the Earth's Difk, it's Axis, the Axis of the Ecliptick, and the Path 
of the Vertex, on the aforefaid Plane : and this is the Projection we are to delineate. This 
being prefuppofed, it will follow ; 

1. That when the Sun is in &amp;, Si, «P, =&amp;, "1, +, the Northern half of the Earth's 
Axis projected on the aforefaid Plane, viewed on that Side next to the Earth, lies 
to the Right-Hand from the Axis of the Ecliptick : But if the Longitude of the 
Sun be in any of the fix oppoGte Signs, it lies to the Left-Hand from the Axis of the 
Ecliptick. 

2. When the Sun's apparent Place happens to be either in v, «, v, 2?, Si, tP, 
the North Pole lies in the illuminate, or vifible part cf the Difk ; but otherways in the 
cbfcure. 

3. When the Sun's Place in the Ecliptick is 90 Degrees d iff ant from either Pole* 
that is, when the Sun is in the Equator, the Paths cf the Vertices, or all Circles of the 
Earth parallel to the Equator, will be projected in right Lines upon the faid Plane : but 
if the Sun's Place be leffer than 90 Degrees, the faid Paths will be projected in Ellipfes upon 
the faid Plane, whofe conjugate Diameters will be fo much the lefTtr, as the Place of the Sun 
is leffer. 

4. The tranfverfe Diameter of the Ellipfes reprefenting any Path, is equal to double the 
right Sine of the Diltance of the faid Vertex from the Pole ; that is, equal to twice the 
Co-Sine of the Latitude of the Place or Vertex : but the Conjugate, to the Difference of the 
right Sines of the Sum, and Difference of the Difrances of the Path and Sun from the Pole j 
that is, equal to the Sine of the Complement of the Sun's Declination added to the Co-La- 
titude of the Place, lefs the right Sine of the Difference of the Complement of the Sun's 
Declination, and the Co-Latitude of the Place. 

5. The tranfverfe Diameter lies at right Angles to the Earth's Axis, and the conjugate 
sp-incides therewith.

SECTION I. 

To reprefent in P!a?io, the Path of a Vertex in the Earth's Difk, whofe Dijlance 

from the North Pole is 38 Deg 32 Min. the Sun's Place being in 10 Deg. 40 

Min. 30 Sec. of Gemini, femblable to that which will be projected on a Plane t 

touching the Earth's Orbit in that Pointy by fir ait Lines produced from the Sun to 

the Earth. 

HAVING drawn the Semi-Circle HER, let it reprefent the Northern half of the p} a t e lc , 
Earth's illuminate Difk (becaufe the Sun is in Gemini) projected upon the faid Plane, F] - 
the Sun it's Center, the Point therein oppofite to the Sun, H o R an Arc of the Ecliptick ' S 
paffing through it. Upon O raife G E, perpendicular to the Ecliptick H R, and the Point 
E wherein it interfecls the Limb of the Difk, will be the Pole of the Ecliptick, and C; E 
it's Axis. 

Again ; Make O E equal to the Radius of a Line of Chords (by Ufe III. of the Line of 
Chords)^ from which taking the Chord of 23 Deg. 30 Min. (the conftant Diftance of the two 
Poles) fet it off both ways from E to B and C, draw the Line B C, in which the Northern 
Pole of the World mail be found. 

Make B A equal to A C, the half of this Line, the Radius of a Line of Sines, and there- 
in fet off the Sine of the Sun's Diftance from the folftitial Colure 19 Deg. 19 Min. 30 Sec. 
from A to P, on the Left-Hand of the Axis of the Ecliptick (becaufe the Sun is in Gemini)* 
arid draw the Line O P, which will be the Axis of the Earth, and P the Place of the North- 
Pole in the illuminate Hemifphere of the Difk. 

Or the Angle E O I, which the Axis of the Earth and Ecliptick make with each other, 
may be more accurately determined by Calculation. For,

Tangent of the Inclination of the Axis - - - - * 8 10 54 9^57^7 

Count the faid 8 Deg. 10 Min. 54 Sec. in the Limb of the Difk from E to I, on the 
Left-hand, and draw the Line O I, this fhall be the Axis ; and the Point P wherein it inter- 
fects the Line B C, the Place of the Pole in the illuminate Difk. 

The next thing required will be the Sun's Diftance from the Pole, or the Complement of 
his Declination, which will be found 6y Deg. 57 Min. 48 Sec. this added to the Diftance 
of the Vertex from the Pole 38 Deg. 32 Min. makes 106 Deg. 29 Min. 48 Sec. and the 
fame 38 Deg. $1 Min. taken from 6y Deg. 51 Min. 48 Sec. gives 29 Deg. 25 Min. 48 Sec. 
the Meridional Diftance of the Sun from the Vertex. 

Make- o E the Radius of the Difk, to be the Radius of a Line of Sines, from 
which take the Sine of 73 Deg. 30 Min. 12 Sec. (the Complement of 106 Deg. 29 
Min. 48 Sec. to a Semi-Circle) and fet it off in the Axis from O to 12 j it there gives 
the Meridional Interferon of the Nocturnal Arc of the Path with the Axis, 

Take the Sine of 29 Deg. 25 Min. 48 Sec. from the fame Line of Sines, and kt it off 
the fame way from to M, and it there gives the InterfecYion of the diurnal Arc of 
the Path with the Meridian. Whence M 12 will be the conjugate Diameter of the 
Path, it being the Difference of the Sines of 70 Deg. 30 Min. 12 Sec. and 29 Deg. 25 
Min. 48 Sec. that is, the Difference of the Sines of the Sum, and Difference of the Di- 
ftances of the Path and Sun from the Pole, which will be the conjugate Diameter of any 
Path. 

Bifect 12 M in C, and through it draw 6 C 6 at right Angles to the Axis of the Globe § 
and then taking the Sine of 38 Deg. 32 Min. the Diftance of the Pole from the Vertex, fee 
it off from C both ways to 6 and 6; then the Line 6 6 will be the Tranverfe-Diameter of 
the Path, and C 6 the Semi-Diameter. 

Making C 6 equal to the Radius of a Line of Sines, if from the fame you take the 
right Sines of 15, 30, 45, 60, y$ Degrees, and fet them off feverally both ways from C in 
the Tranverfe-Diameter, and from the Points fo found erect Perpendiculars, a 11, a 1, 
a io, a 2, &amp;c. equal to the Co-Sines of the faid Arcs, taken from a Line of Sines, whofe 
Radius fhall be C 12, equal to C M, you will have twenty-four Points given, through 
which the Ellipfis reprefenting the Path fhall pafs, which fhall alfo fhew the Place of the 
Vertex at every Hour of the Day. In the fame manner may the Parts of an Hour be pricked 
down in the Path, in laying off the Sine of the Degrees and Minutes correfponding thereto 
from C towards 6, and then raiting Perpendiculars from the Points fo found in the Semi- 
Tranfverfe, and fctting off from the faid Semi-Tranfverfe each way upon the Perpendiculars, 

* the 



2,6a The Ufe of the Sector in the 

the Sines of the Complements of the Degrees and Minutes correfponding (o the aforefaid 
Parts of an Hour. As, for Example ; To denote half an Hour pait n and 12, cake the 
Sine of 7 Deg. 30 Min. and lay it effon both fides from C to b and b ; then take the Co-fine 
of 7 Deg. 30 Min. and having raifed the Perpendiculars b ', lay off the laid Sine-Comple- 
ment from b to f, and you will have the Points in the Periphery of the Eliipfts, for half 
an Hour pafb n, and half an Hour pafi 12 ; and in this manner may the Path be divided 
into Minutes, if the Ellipfis be large enough. 

Take this for another Example; Suppoie I would reprefent upon the Plane of the Earth's 
Difk, the Path of Gibraltar ', whofe Latitude is 35 Deg. 32 Min. North, and the Sun's Place 
is in 15 Deg. 45 Min. of Leo. 
Pig- 2- Having, as before, drawn the Semi-Circle H E R, for the Northern half of the Earth's 

illuminate Difk, and drawn O E perpendicular to R H, as alio drawn the Lane C B, which 
is always equal to twice the Chord of the Sun's greateft Declination, 23 Deg. 30 Min. you 
muft next make AB equal to a Radius of a Line of Sines, and then lay off from A to P, 
on the Right-hand of the Axis of the Ecliptick (becaufe the Sun is in Leo), the Sine of the 
Sun's Diftance from the folftitial Colure 45 Deg. 45 Mm. or, the Angle E O I may be 
more nicely determined by Calculation, as was before directed, and then © P I, will be the 
Axis of the World. 

Now the Sun's Diftance from the Pole, or the Complement of his Declination is 73 Deo-. 
51 Min. which being added to the Complement of the Latitude 54 Deg. 28 Min. the Sum 
will be 128 Deg. 19 Min. and this taken from 180 Deg. the Remainder will be 51 Deg-. 41 
Min. alfo if 54 Deg. 28 Min. be taken from 73 Deg. 51 Min. the Difference will be iQ°De°-. 
23 Min. 

Then if you make the Semi-Diameter of the Difk the Radius of a Line of Sines, and 
lay oft from the Center O to 12, the Sine of 55 Deg. 41 Min. the Point 12 in the Axis will 
be the Meridional Interferon of the Nocturnal Arc of the Path with the Axis •, and if 
again you lay off the Sine of 19 Deg. 23 Min. irom © to M, you will have the Meridional 
Interaction of the Diurnal Arc of the Path with the Axis ; whxce M 12 will be the con- 
jugate Diameter of the Elliptical Path. 

And if you bifecl M 1 2 in C, and draw the Line 6 C 6 at right Angles to the Axis 
© I ; and then lay off the Sine Complement of the Latitude 54 Deg. 28 Min. from C to 6, 
on each fide the Axis, you will have the Tranfverfe diameter of the Path, which may be 
drawn and divided, as before directed, for that of Fig. I. 

Note, When the elevated Pole is in the obfeure Hemifphere of the Earth, the diurnal 
Arc, or illuminated Part of the Path, is in that Part of the Ellipfis that lies neareft -to the 
faid Pole, but ocherways b the more remote ; and where the Ellipfis cuts the Limb of the 
Difk, are the Points on it from which the Sun appears to rife and fet, &amp;e. And becaufe 
thefe Points are necefTary to be found, when an Eclipfe happens near Sun-riling or Sun-fet- 
ting, they may be determined in the following manner: 
Sig 1. Lay off the Sun's Declination 22 Deg. 2 Min. upon the Limb of the Difk from R to N, 

as alfo the Complement of the Latitude of 38 Deg. 32 Min. from R to P •, then draw the 
Line © N, and from the Point P let fall upon the Diameter R H, the Perpendicular P Q^, 
cutting the Line © N in L. This being done, take the Extent G L, between your Com- 
pafTes, and lay it off upon the Axis © I from © to K •, then draw a Line both ways from 
the Point K, parallel to the tranfverfe Axis C 6 of the Path, and the faid Line will cut the 
Limb of the Difk in the Points q p of the Sun's rifing and fetting. 

Or the Arc Ip may be more accurately determined by Calculation ; for in the Triangle 
O Q^L, right-angled at Q^, are given the Angle CKL O, equal to the Sun's Diftance from 
the Pole •, and thf Side Q^G equal to the Sine of tke Latitude. To find the Side O L, 
which is equal to the Sine Complement of the Arc I p, the Canon is, As the Sine of the 
Sun's Diftance from the Pole, is to Radius ; So is the Sine of the Latitude to the Sine Com- 
plement of the Arc I p, or I q.

Thefe being found from Aftronomical Tables and Calculations, I mall mew how to draw 
the Line of the Moon's Way, or Path of the Penumbra, upon the Plane of the Earth's Difk, 
as it falls at the Time of the Conjunction of May 1 1, 1724, and the manner of dividing the 
fame, for London, Genoa, and Rome. 

Having drawn the Semi-Circle HER of the Earth's Difk, and the Paths of London, Plate 26* 
Genoa, and Rome, by the Directions of the laft Section, the Sun's Place being 61 Deg. pj~ , 
38 Min. 45 Sec. and the Latitude of London 51 Deg. 30 Min. that of Genoa 44Deg. 27 Min. 
and that of Rome 41 Deg. 51 Min. you muft next draw the Perpendicular to the Moon's 
Way •, which is done .thus : Take the Semi-Diameter O H of the Difk between your Com- 
pafTcs, and open your Sector fo, that the Diftance from 60 to 60 of Chords be equal to 
that Extent; then taking 5 Deg. 37 Min. parallel-wife from the Lines of Chords (which is 
the Angle of the Moon's Way with the Ecliptick, or the Angle that a Perpendicular to her 
Way makes with the Axis E O of the fame Ecliptick), lay them off upon the Limb of the 
Difk from E to F, on the Right-hand of the Axis of the Ecliptick, becaufe the Argument 
of Latitude is more than three Sines, and the Line O F being drawn, will be the Perpendi- 
cular to the Moon's Way at the Time of the general Conjunction, May 11, 1 724. 

Again : Take the Semi-Diameter of the Difk between your CompafTcs, and open the Sec- 
tor fo, that the Diftance from 61 ~*, the Semi-Diameter of the Difk, on each Line of Lines 
be equal to that Extent ; then the Sector remaining thus opened, take between your Com- 
paflTes the parallel Extent of 32 ~ + , the neareft Approach of the Moon to the Center of the 
Difk, and lay it off from O to M, upon the Perpendicular to the Moon's Way ; then, if 
upon the Point M, a Perpendicular, as M G, be drawn both ways, this will be the Line of 
the Moon's Way, or Path of the Penumbra. 

Now to divide the faid Path into it's proper Hours, which let be for London. The mid- 
dle of the general Eclipfe, or the Time when the Moon's Center will be at M, happens at 12 
Minutes paft 5 in the Afternoon : fay, As 1 Flour or 60 Minutes is to %5 Min. 18 Stc. the 
hourly Motion of the Moon from the Sun ; So is 12 Minutes the Time more than 5 in the 
Afternoon, to 7 Min. 3 Sec. the Motion from 5 a-Clock to the middle. 

Your Sector remaining opened to the laft Angle it was fet to, take the Extent from 7 ~ to 
7 A- on each Line of Lines, and fetting one Foot of your CompafTcs upon M, with the 
other make a Point on the Moon's Way to the Right-hand ; and this fhall be the Place of 
the Penumbra at 5 a-Clock in the Afternoon at London ; which therefore denote with the 
Number V. 

The hourly Motion of the Moon from the Sun is 35 Min. 18 Sec. therefore take the pa- 
rallel Extent of 35',?, on the Line of Lines, between your Compaffes, and fetting one Foot 
upon V, with the other make Points on each fide V, thefe fhall fhew the Place of the Moon's 
Center at the Hours of IV and VI ; and if from thefe Points you farther fet off the faid Ex- 
tent in the faid Line, you may thereby find the Place of the Moon's Center for every Hour, 
v/hilft the Penumbra fhall touch the Difk : and if the Space between every Flour be divided 
into 60 equal Parts, you fhall have the Place of the Moon's Center in the Line of her Way, 
to every fingle Minute of Time. 

Or, you may take the Semi- Diameter of the Difk between your CompafTcs, and make a 
Scale thereof, in dividing it, by means of the Sector, in the following manner: Open the 
Sector fo, that the Diftance between 61 ff, the Semi-Diameter of the Difk, and 61 -i* on 
the Line of Lines, be equal to the Semi-Diameter of the Difk. This Diftance lay off from 

X x x A to 



262 The Ufe of the Se&amp;or in the 

A to B : then your Sector remaining thus opened, take between your CompafTes fucceftive- 
ly, the parallel Diftances of each Divifion to 61 £*, and lay them off from A towards B, 
every 5th of which Number, and your Scale will be divided into Minutes. And by the fame 
Method you may divide each Minute into Parts, ferving for Seconds, if your Scale be long 
enough. Now your Scale being divided, you may make ufe thereof, for drawing and di- 
viding the Path of the Penumbra, without the Sector : For 32 44 of thefe Parts of the Scale, 
give you the neareft Diftance of the Moon's Center to the Center of the Difk. Alfo 7 ^ 
Parts of the faid Scale, will be the Diftance of the Center of the Penumbra from the Point 
M, at five a-Clock ; and 35 44 of the Parts of the Scale, will be the Diftance from Hour to 
Hour, on the Path of the Penumbra. 

Now to fix Numbers upon the faid Path of the Penumbra, reprefenting the Hours when 
the Moon's Center will be at the faid Hours, at Rome and Genoa, we muft have the Dif- 
ference of Longitude between London and the faid two Places given ; as alfo, whether 
they are to the Eaft or Weft from London; the Difference of Longitude between London and 
Rome, is 12 Deg. 37 Min. and between London and Genoa, is 9 Deg. 37 Min. they being both 
to the Eaft from London. Each of thefe being reduced to Time, the former will be 50 Mi- 
nutes, and the latter 38 Minutes, wherefore 5 a-Clock for Rome on the Moon's Way, muft 
be at 10. Min. pad 4, {ox London ; and 6 a-Clock at 10 Minutes paft five, &amp;c. Underftand 
the fame for other Hours and Minutes. I have noted the Hours for Rome under the Line 
of the Moon's Way, with Roman Characters. Again, 5 a-Clock on the Moon's Way for 
Genoa, muft be fet at 22 Minutes paft 5 for London ; and 6 a-Clock, at 22 Minutes paft 
6, ciJV. I have noted the Hours for Genoa with fmall Figures over the Line of the Moon's 
Way. 

Note, The 10 Minutes, and 22, are each of them the Complement of 50 Minutes, and 38 
Minutes to 60 Minutes. 

SECTION III. 

To determine the apparent Time of the Beginning or End of a Solar Eclipfe, the Time 
when the Sun foall be eclipfed to any pojjible Number of Digits, the Inclination of 
the Cuffs of the Eclipfe, and the Time of the vifble Conjunction of the Luminaries^ 
in any given Latitude. 

TH E Paths of London. Rome, and Genoa, as alfo the Path of the Penumbra being drawn 
and divided, as directed in the two laft Sections for the great Eclipfe of 1724, which 
•will be a very proper Example for fufficiently explaining this Method, take between your 
CompafTes the Semi-Diameter of the Penumbra 32 ■£-£, from the Line of Lines on the Sector, 
it being firft opened to the Semi-Diameter of the Difk 61 |4 *, or you may take it from your 
Scale, which being done, carry one Foot of your CompafTes along the Line of the Moon's 
Way, from the Right-hand to the Left •, wherein find fuch a Point, that if the faid Foot 
be fet, the other Foot fhall cut the fame Hour or Minute, in the Path of the Vertex of any 
given Place ; then the Points in the Paths upon which either of the Feet of your CompafTes 
ftand, will fhew the Time of the Beginning of the Eclipfe at that Place. 

For example ; If you carry the Semi-Diameter of the Difk along the Line of the Moon's 
Way, you will find that one Foot of the CompafTes being fet at a, on the Moon's Way, 
which is 41 Min. paft 5 in the Afternoon for London, the other Foot will fall on the Point b 
©n the Path of London, which is likewife 41 Min. paft 5 in the Afternoon ; wherefore the 
Beginning of the Eclipfe ax. London will be at 41 Min. paft 5 in the Afternoon. 

Again : If you carry ftill on the Foot of your CompafTes, they remaining yet opened to 
the Semi-Diameter of the Difk, and find another Point on the Moon's Way, whereon if you 
fix one Point of your CompafTes, the other fhall cut the Path of the Vertex at the fame 
Hour or Minute, which this ftands upon in the Line of the Moon's* Way, the Points whereon 
your CompafTes ftand in either Path, fhall fhew the Minute the Eclipfe ends. 

For example : One Foot of the CompafTes being fet to g in the Path of the Vertex, which 
is 29 Min. paft 7 in the Afternoon, the other Foot will fall upon the Line of the Moon's 
Way, a: the fame Hour and Minute, viz. 29 Min. paft 7 ; therefore the Eclipfe ends at 
London 29 Min. paft 7 : but take notice, that the Line of the Moon's Way fliould be conti- 
nued further out beyond 7 a-Clock, that fo the Point of the CompafTes may fall upon the 
proper Minute, to wit, 29. 

Moreover : If one fide of a Square be applied to the Ecliptick H R, and fo moved back- 
wards or forwards, until the other fide of the faid Square cuts the fame Hour or Minute in 
the Path of the Vertex, and Line of the Moon's Way ; this fame Hour or Minute will be the 
Time of the vifible Conjunction of the Luminaries at the given Place. 

For example ; When the perpendicular fide of the Square cuts the Path of the Moon's 
Way at e, which is 37 Min. paft 6, the faid fide will likewife cut the Path of the Vertex for 
London at c, which is 37 Min. paft 6 ; therefore the Time of the vifible Conjunction of the 
Luminaries at London will be 37 Min. after 6, 

Draw 



Conftru&amp;ion of Solar Eclipfe s. 2,63 

Draw the Line a b, as alfo the Line O b ; this mall reprefent the vertical Circle, and the 
Angle © b a will be the Angle that the vertical Circle makes with the Line connecting the 
Centers of the Sun and Moon, at the Beginning of the Eclipfe at London. 

Draw the Line g m ; to wit, join the Points in the Path of the Vertex, and the Puth of the 
Moon's Way, which fhews the End of the Eclipfe at London ; and the Line O g - y then the 
Angle O g m, will be that which the vertical Circle forms with the Line joining the Centers 
of the Luminaries. 

Take the Semi-Diameter of the Sun, viz. 15 44 between your Compaffes, either from your 
Sector, opened as before directed, to the Semi-Diameter of theDifk, or from your Scale, and 
with that upon the Center c (to wit, the Minute in the Path of London, whereat the Time of 
the vifible Conjunction happens) defcribe a Circle ; this Circle fhall reprefent the Sun. 

Again -, Take the Moon's Semi-Diameter 16%-% from your Sector (remaining opened as 
before), or your Scale, and upon the Center e (to wit, the Minute in the Path of the Moon's 
Way, whereat the true Conjunction happens at London) defcribe another Circle. This fhall 
cut off from the former Circle fo much as the Sun will be eclipfed, at the Time of the vifible 
Conjunction. 

From O draw the Line 0^: This mall reprefent the vertical Circle, and v the vertical 
Point in the Sun's Limb, whereby the Pofition of the Cufps of the Eclipfe, in refpect of the 
Perpendicular paffing thro' the Sun's Center, are plainly and eafily had. 

Produce d c 'till it interfects the Moon's Limb in p, then fhall p q be the part of the Sun's 
Diameter eclipfed, ?t the Time of the greateft Obfcuration at London : And if the Sun's 
Diameter be divided into 12 equal Parts, or Digits, you will find p q to be 11 -££s of thofe 
Parts or Digits.

And the Beginning of the Eclipfe at Rome is - - - 06 42 

The vifible Conjunction, or Middle, will there be when the Sun is fet a and confequcntty

I have, as you fee in the Figure, alfo drawn a fourth Path (or Edinburgh, whofe Latitude 
is $$ Deg. 56 Min. and Longitude about 3 Deg. to the Weft from London. Wherefore for each 
Hour in the Moon's Way for London, you ffiuft account 1 2 Min. more for the fame Hour at 
Edinburgh ; that is, for example, 5 a-Clock on the Line of the Moon's Way for Edinburgh) 
muft ftand at 1 2 Min. paft 5 at London. Underftand the fame for other Hours, &amp;V. 

And by proceeding according to the Directions before given, you will find,

Note, The Path of the Moon's Way ought to be continued out further to the Left-hand* 
in order to determine the Time of the End of the Eclipfe at Edinburgh. 

If you have a mind to know at what Time any poffible Number of Digits or Minutes 
fhall be eclipfed at any Place in the Sun's antecedent or confequent Limb ; divide the Sun's 
Diameter into Digits or Minutes, and cut off the Parts required to be eclipfed from the 
Semi-Diameter of the Penumbra ; then take the remaining part of it between your Com- 
paffes, and carrying it along the Line of the Moon's Way, find the firft Point in it, in which 
placing one Foot, the other will cut the fame Hour in the Path of the Place that the fixed 
Foot ftands upon ; then the Hour and Minute in either Path upon which the Feet of your 
Compaffes ftand, will be the Time of that Obfcuration. 

As, for example •, Suppofe it was required to find at what Time 6 Digits or 4- of the Sun's 
Diameter fhall be eclipfed in his antecedent Limb at London : Cut off 4 of the Sun's Semi- 
Diameter from the Semi-Diameter of the Penumbra, and carrying the Remainder, as directed, 
you will find, that if one Point of your Compaffes be fet at 6 Hours 9 Minutes in the After- 
noon, on the Path of the Moon's Way, the other Point will alfo fall upon the fame Hour 
and Minute in the Path of London -, and therefore the Time when the Sun's antecedent Limb 

* at 



264 Sfife Ufe of the Sector, &amp;c. 

at London will be half eclipfed, will be at 9 Minutes paft 6 ; and when it's confequent Limb 
will be half eclipfed, will be at 5 Minutes paft 7. 

Fig. 2, Now to determine the Pofition of the Cufps of the Eclipfe, for example, at London : 

Draw a Circle A D B E, reprefenting the Sun's Body, and the right Line A C B, reprefent- 
ing his vertical Diameter. This being done, lay off the Angle © b a upon the Sun's Limb 
from A to D, draw the Diameter E C D, and the Point D will be the firlt Point of the Sun's 
Limb obfcured by the Moon at the Beginning of the Eclipfe. 

Fig. 3. Again ; To determine the Pofition and Appearance of the Eclipfe at the Time of the 

middle, or greateft Obfcuration, take the Sun's Semi-Diameter between your CompaiTes, and 
upon the Point C, defcribe a Circle •, then draw the vertical Diameter A C B, and make the 
Angle A C D equal to the Angle v c p, and draw the Diameter D C F. This bein» done 
take the Moon's Semi-Diameter between your CompaiTes, and having laid off from the 
Center C to E, the Diftance c e in. the firft Figure ; upon the Point E, as a Center, de- 
fcribe an Arc cutting the Sun's Limb, and the Pofition and Appearance of the Eclipfe at 
the Time of the greateft Obfcuration, or the middle, at London, will be as you fee in the 
Figure. 

Laftly, To determine the Pofition of the End of the Eclipfe, draw a Circle (as in the 4 th 
Figure), and crofs it with the vertical Diameter ACB; then make the Angle ACE equal 
to the Angle O g m, and draw the Diameter E D •, then will the Point E on the Limb of the 
Sun, be that which is laft obfcured, or whereat the Eclipfe ends. 

If you have a mind to find the Continuation of total Darknefs at any Place where the Sun 
will be totally eclipfed, cut off the Semi-Diameter of the Sun, from the Semi-Diameter of 
the Penumbra, and taking the Remainder between your Compafles, carry it along the Line 
of the Moon's Way, and find the firft Point in it j on which placing one Foot, the other 
will cut the fame Hour in the Path of the Place, which Hour note dow r n. Again -, Carrying 
on further the fame Extent of your Compaffes, find two Points on the Paths of the Vertex and 
Moon's Way, which fhall fhew the fame Hour and Minute on them both. This Time alfo 
note down ; then fubftracl the Time before found from this Time, and the Difference will 
be the Time of Continuance of total Darknefs.

T is now almoft forty Years fince I tranllated Mr Bions French Book 
of Mathematical Instruments into Englijh. I did it with Reluctance, 
at the Defire of Friends, and a little for the Sake of Interefl, the Sub- 
ject becoming fomewhat unpleafant to me, at that Time, by Ufe and 
long Acquaintance j for having at firft moflly applied myfelf, even from twelve 
Years of Age, in the Knowledge of Mathematical Inflruments, I began to be tired 
and fatiated, as I may fay, with them, when I undertook this Work, although they 
are generally fo pleafing and ufeful, and betook myfelf to the more refined and diffi- 
cult Branches of the Mathematicks. I was reading, and trying to underfland Sir 
Ifaac Newton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philofophy, at the Time I was pre- 
vailed upon to tranflate Mr Bions Book, which I liked to do much better. The 
defire of travelling further, and -acquiring new Knowledge in this amiable Science is 
very natural to one who loves it. But having fet about the Bufinefs, I foon perceived 
that many French Inflruments of Mr Bions were excelled by fome of ours, of the 
fame kind in Contrivance ; and as to Workmanfhip, I never did fee one French In- 
flrument fo well framed and divided, as fome of ours have been ; for Example, Mr 
Sutton's Quadrants, made above one hundred Years ago, are the fined divided In- 
flruments in the World ; and the Regularity and Ex?xtnefs of the vafi Number of 
Circles drawn upon them is highly delightful to behold. The mural Quadrant at 
the Royal Obfervatory at Greenwich, far exceeds that of the Royal Obfervatory at 
Paris. Alfo the Theodolites of Mr Sijfon and Heath. The Clocks and Watches 
of Mr Graham, Tompion, and Quare. The Orreries of Mr Graham and Mr Wright. 
And many more curioufly contrived, and well executed Mathematical Inflruments 
which I could mention, far exceed thofe of the French, or indeed any other Na- 
tion in the World. The making good Mathematical Inflruments is almofl pecu- 
liar to the Englijh, as well as their Skill in all Branches of the Mathematicks and 
Natural Philofophy has been generally fuperior to that of other Nations. 

I therefore thought of adding fome Englijh Inflruments to thofe of Mr Bion, and 
accordingly made choice of fuch which I thought were then preferable to his of the 
fame Kind, and moil pleafing to me. 

This firfl Impreflion being publifhed, imperfect as it was, rather for want of Incli- 
nation in me, than Abilities to make it better, was foon fold off; and the Bookfeller 
and others, at Times for many Years lafl pafl, were putting me in mind of preparing 
a iecond Impreflion with Additions. But being at thofe Times always immerged in 

Y y y 2 other 



A D VERTISEMENT. 

other more delightful Branches of the Mathematicks, efpecially pure Geometry and 
Mechanicks, I declined doing it. But having at laft been prevailed upon, through feve- 
ral Motives, this fecond Impreflion is here published, with a Supplement or Appendix, 
containing the Defcriptions, and fome of the Uies of fuch Inftruments as were before 
omitted, or have been made better, as I thought fince, for the Purpcfes defigned by 
them, and wherein there are fome other Inftruments, though juft touched upon and 
defcribed, yet there is given fo much of their Nature and Ufe, as may fatisfy theCuriofi- 
ty of fome ; and for thofe who defire more ample and compleat Defcriptions of them, 
I have fo far fatisfied their Wifhes, as to point out fome of the feveral Writings where 
they are treated of more at large. 

In a Word, this Treatife here published is a fufficient Explanation of the main 
Body of all the Inftruments of the moft Value, and in the greateft Efteem, that are 
generally made, and fold in the Shops of the Mathematical Inftrument-Makers, and 
which have been contrived to anfwer the various ufeful Purpofes of practical Mathe- 
maticks. And if a better Book on this Subject has not yet been compiled, it is becaufe 
the able Geometricians, who are the moft capable of making one, have the leaft Incli- 
nation for it, becaufe of the fmall Honour and Reputation they would acquire by it ; 
and thus it has happened that there never has yet been a very good Book upon this 
Subject.

plying the Root by ioo. The fame Scales of Divifions are likewife upon the part, or half 
C L, of the long Rule G C, beginning near the Point C. The firft of thefe Divifions of 
equal Parts are for fixing the long Rule C G, and the Sockets, fo as to readily defcribe a 
Figure, whofe Circuit (hall have a given Proportion to the Circuit of a given fimilar Fi- 
gure. The fecond, for the Defcription of a Figure whofe Area fhall have a given Propor- 
tion, to the Area of a given fimilar Figure. And the third, for the Defcription of the re- 
prefentation of a Solid that fhall have a given Proportion to a given Solid. 

Dd is a turned Brafs Pillar about | of an Inch long, with a Worm at the End to go 
into a very even Table ; the Sides FD, D E of the Parallelogram are fattened to the Top 
D of this, fo as to be any ways moveable horizontally. And at the Ends B, C, are equal 
round Holes wherein are put a Steel Point C c for moving over every part of a given Fi- 
gure or Draught, and a Pencil Point B b for defcribing a Figure or Draught fimilar to a 
given one. Laftly, The turned Brafs Pillar A a has a free horizontal Motion about the 
Point A, and a little Wheel a upon the Bottom of it to run upon the Table, like one of 
the Legs of a Child's Go-Cart. The Lengths of thefe Pillars and the two Points C c , B b 
muft be fuch, that in all Pofitions of the Parallelogram the Points d, c, b, a&gt; may be in 
one Plane, viz. upon the Surface of the Table, or of a Paper laid upon it. 

The Ufeof this Inftrument is contained in the Defcription, fufHciently to be apprehended 
by any intelligent Perfon. 

II. Of the Camera Obfcura. 

This is a Room darkened in the Day-time, and chiefly when the Sun fhines, having a 
Convex-Glafs or Lens placed in an Hole in the Window-fhutter, through which Glafs the 
Light only paffes into the Room ; which GJafs if properly placed, will project the Pictures 
of Objects from without Doors, inverted upon any white upright Surface within the Room, 
placed at it's focal Diflance from the Glafs. And here it is to be noted, firft, that the 
Pictures will appear more bright and lively in the Morning, if the Window and Objects 
be to the Welt, and contrariwife in the Afternoon, if the Window and Objects be to the 
Eaft, and about Noon if the Window and Objects be Northwardly. 

For the Convenience of directing the Axis of the Glafs towards any Object, the Lens is 
placed in a large cylindrical Hole boared through the middle of a wooden Ball, called a 
Sky Optick-ball, which is eafily moved about it's Centre, within a hollow wooden Zone, 
and fattened to the Window-fhutter : This Zone confifts of two half Zones fcrewed toge- 
ther in the middle after the Ball was let in ; and the Concavity of the Zone hinders the 
Light from paffing between it and the Ball. 

When the focal Diftance of the Lens is 8 or 10 Feet, the Pictures of the Objects may be 
received upon a large Screen covered with white Paper, or Linnen, or painted white, and 
to have it moveable upon fmall Wheels, that fo it may be brought to a proper Diftance 
from the Lens. 

The Pictures of the Objects will be fo much the larger as the focal Diftance of the Lens 
is longer, and fo much the brighter, all things elfe the fame, as it's Aperture is larger. 

The inverted Pictures may be viewed upright by reflecting them downwards upon a Table 
by means of a Looking-Glafs, whofe Surface is fet at an half right Angle, or thereabouts, 
to the Horizon. 

To draw Copies of Prints, Paintings, &amp;c. by tracing their PicJures formed by the Lens. 

Place the Original at a proper Diftance without Doors, and let it's Picture within the dark 
Room be received upon a Sheet of Paper, or upon a large plane Glafs, not polifhed on one 
fide ♦, this Glafs being placed upright with it's rough fide turned from the Window, you 
may eafily trace upon it with a Black-lead Pencil, the Out-Lines of the Picture. And if a 
Sheet of fine Paper be ftrained over the Glafs, the Strokes of the Pencil will appear through 
it when held againft the Sky-light •, and thus the Picture may be drawn upon the Paper. 
But note, The eafieft way of making the Image diftinct upon the Glafs, when fixed, is to 
place the Lens in a Tube that fhall flide within another fhort Tube fixed in the Window- 
Shutter. 

To do this without the Trouble of making two "Draughts. 

Having ftrained the drawing Paper upon a fmooth Board, lay it upon a firm Table, to 
be placed under the Lens in the Window-fhutter, and let an inclined Looking-Glafs g h i k, 
Fig. 2. N. I to refl e &amp; tne Picture upon that Paper, be fixed over the Table a c , thus, a b and c d (Fig. 2. 
N. I.) are two Boards fixed upright upon the Table on each hand of the drawing Paper •, p a\ 
and e f is a third Board equal in Length to the Diftance between the upright Boards having 
a round Pin at each End of it ; when this Board is laid over the back-fide of a Looking- 
Glafs, and fcrewed to the Frame of it, the Pins muft be lodged in two Slits at the Tops 
of the upright Boards •, and by twoNuts that fcrew upon the Pins. The Glafs may be ftayed 
at a proper Inclination for throwing the Picture directly down upon the Paper bdow, 

and 



and making the Pi Shires of ObjeSts. 

and then it may be made diftinct by moving the Tube that holds the Lens inwards or 
outwards. 

III. Of the portable Camera Obfcura. 

This Inftrument when carrying or not ufed, is like a wooden Box, and fome of them are 
more like very large Folio Books ; the rtafon of the whole Contrivance is this. The Rays 
of Light that come from the Object P CjR, after parting through the Lens E, are tending to Fig. 2. N. H. 
form an Image p q r, but being reflected upwards by the Looking-Glafs ABC, they 
form an horizontal Image x z, upon a Glafs Plane, whofe unpolifhed fide lies uppermoflr, 
upon which a Copy of the Picture may be fketched out by a Black-lead Pencil ; and to the 
Spectator facing the Object the Picture appears upright, there is only reprefented in this 
Figure a Section of the Inftrument through the Axis of the Tube that holds the Lens, and 
through the middle of the Box and Looking-Glafs within it : The Section of the Side op- 
pofite to the Tube is not here reprefented, it is only a Door opening fide ways •, the Edges 
of the rough Glafs at the Top are placed in two Grooves upon the Sides of the Box, and 
being taken off, it is placed in a Drawer e /, at the Bottom of the Box ; the Looking-Glafs 
ABC may alfo be drawn out of the Grooves in the Sides of the Box and lodged in the 
fame Drawer. The fquare wooden Tube confifts of three Parts ; the innermoft that carries 
the Lens draws inwards or outwards, to make the Pictures diftinct ; the Parts g h, i k, be- 
ing fixed together, and to the Box, with fmall Bolts, may be taken afunder and put into the 
Box •, then the Lid a t at the Top, and the Door at the End, being both fhut and fixed, 
the Inftrument becomes more commodious for carriage ; the infide of the Lid whofe Sec- 
tion is a t (Fig. 3.) has two Wings that open at right Angles on each Side of it, and 
reft upon the Sides of the Box, to darken as much as poflible the Image upon the rough 
Glafs. 

IV. Of another portable Camera Obfcura for drawing. 

Into the middle of the top of a fquare Box (Fig. 4.) there is put an upright Tube, or Fig. £ 
rather a piece of a fquare Pyramid ; in the top of which there Aides a ftiort fquare Tube, 
having a broad Object-Glafs fixed in a Hole at the top of it •, the focal Diftance of the Glafs 
being fomewhat lefs than it's utmoft Height above the Bottom of the Box, where the Pic- 
tures of Objects are to be formed by it : upon one edge of the Top of this Tube there 
turns a Lid, having a plane Looking-Glafs fixed fiat upon the infide of it, and thereby 
capable of being ftayed at any inclination proper for reflecting the Rays that come from an 
Object directly downwards through the Object-Glafs, to the drawing Paper fixed upon the 
Bottom of the Box, where the Picture of the Object will be diftinctly painted, when the 
Object-Glafs is fet to a proper Height : the Box being quite clofed and dark within, this 
Picture is viewed through a fmall Hole in the upper Edge of the Box Hoped off from the 
Side oppofite to the Object where the Draught's-Man ftands, and puts his Hand and Pencil 
through a Hole made in this fide ; or rather in a long piece that Aides in it horizontally, ac- 
cording as he has occafion to move his Hand. The fc'^Tare Box is a b c d e /, the fixed 
Tube is£-, the Aiding Tube is h, the Object-Glafs is o, the inclined Looking-Glafs is /, the 
Hole for the Eye is k y that for the Hand in the Slider m n is /. 

There are other portable Camera Obfcura's that have been made and are defcribed in 
Books, only differing from thefe either in bignefs or fome lefs efTential Parts. There are 
two of them to be feen at the End of Mr s'Gravefande's Effay on Perfpeilive \ a large one 
•and a fmall one •, the former being almoft like a common Chair, or Sedan, with a folding 
Table in it, to lay the drawing Paper upon, and in which may be put a fmall Stool for the 
Draught's-Man to fit upon. The Convex Lens and inclined Looking-Glafs is a Top over 
the horizontal Table : where he gives fome ufeful Cautions. 1. There muft be ufed but 
one Convex- Glafs, fince when there are two or more the true Appearance of the Object is 
loft : the fame inconvenience will alfo lie in the way, when a Concave Looking-Glafs is 
ufed in the Conftruction of the Machine. 2. When more than two plane Looking-GlafTes 
are ufed, the Rays after a triple Reflexion become fo weak as to obfeure the Appearances 
of the Objects ; and when two Looking-GlafTes are ufed they ought to be well polifhed. 

3. The Looking-GlafTes muft not be put into the Machine, becaufe in fuch a clofe Place 
the Draught's-Man's Breath will fully the GlafTes, which cannot happen to the Convex-Glafs, 
by reafon of it's being inclofed within a Tube. He fays alfo, that the Faces of-Perfons 

may be drawn in Minature, when the Picture of the Perfon upon the drawing Paper is 

not above half an Inch, but when it is bigger it is not eafy to trace out the exact Refem- 

blance, becaufe each Point of the Face has not the fame Focus.

CHAP. II. 



Offome more modern Inflruments ufed at Sea, in taking the Degrees 
of the Altitude of the Sun or Stars, or the Degrees of their Di- 
fiances. 

E S I D E S the Inflruments for this Purpofe already fpoken of in our Treatife of Ma- 
thematical Inflruments, there have been of late Years feveral others actually made, 
defcribed, and ufed for this Purpofe, indeed not effentially differing from one another, all 
of them being defigned to be ufed where the Motion of the Objects, or Obferver, or any 
thing occafioning an unfteadinefs in the other Inflruments when ufing, make the Obferva- 
tions difficult or fubject to Error. 

The firft of thcie Inflruments for taking the Moon's Diflance from the fixed Stars was in- 
vented long ago by Sir Ifaac Newton, as appears in a Paper of Sir Ifaac Newton's own 
Hand-Writing, found amongfl thofe of the late Dr Halley, and the very Inftrument itfelf 
that Sir Ifaac Newton either made himfelf, or caufed to be made fo long ago as when Dr 
Halley went about making the Catalogue of the fixed Stars in the South-Seas, which was in 
the Year -1672, was not long ago to be feen at Mr Heath's the Mathematical Inftrument- 
Maker in the Strand. See the Philofophical Tranfaclions, Number 465, for the Year 1742. 

Many Years after this, Inflruments for doing the fame thing, were publifhed in the Phi- 
lofophical Tranfaftions, Number 420, and 425, under the Name of Mr Hadley's Octants or 
Quadrants, not much differing from Sir Ifaac's. Two or three more of the like, not effen- 
tially varying from the Original one of Sir Ifaac Newton, have alfo been made and pub- 
lifhed under the Name of Mr Caleb Smith, with Engravings of two of them defcribed in a 
printed Sheet of Paper, entituled The Ufe of the new Inftrument, or Sea Quadrant, for taking 
Altitudes of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, from the vifible Horizon, by an Obfervation either 
forwards or backwards, as well as any other angular Diftances, without Impediment or Inter- 
ruption from the Ship's Motion, whereby the Latitude at Sea may be obtained with greater 
Certainty and more frequently, than by any other Inftrument commonly ufed for that purpofe. 
Sold by Mr Heath, Mathematical Inflrument-Maker in the Strand, and feveral other Mathe- 
matical Inftrument- Makers, and by fome Bookfellers too. 

But as Sir Ifaac Newton has now been found to be the flrfb Inventor of this Inftrument, 
and as one of thofe not much different from his, called by the Name of Mr Hadley's Sea- 
Octant or Quadrant, is now m* . J \in vogue and ufed at Sea, I fhall therefore in this Chapter 
give only the Defcription and Ule of Sir Ifaac Newton's Quadrant of this Kind, and that 
other called Mr Hadley's, leaving Mr Smith's to be fcen in the Paper above defcribed. 

I. The Defcription and Ufe of Sir Ifaac Newton'j Sea Inftrument or Quadrant. 

Fig. 5. The Figure P Q,R S denotes a Brafs Plate accurately divided in the Limb D QJnto half 

Degrees half Minutes, and ,' r Minutes by a Diagonal Scale ; and the 4 Degrees, and f 
Minutes, and -,\ Minutes, counted for Degrees, Minutes, and 4- Minutes. AB is a Tele- 
fcope three or four Feet long, fixed on the Edge of that Brafs Plate. G is a Speculum 
fixed on the faid Brafs Plate perpendicularly, fo as to be inclined 45 Degrees to the Axis of 
the Telefcope, and intercept half the Light which would otherwife come from the Tele- 
fcope to the Eye. C D is a moveable Index turning about the Centre C, and with it's fidu- 
cial Edge fhewing the Degrees, Minutes, and ^ Minutes on the Limb of the Brafs Plate 
P Qj the Centre C mud be over againfl the middle of the Speculum G. H is another 
Speculum parallel to the former, when the fiducial Edge of the Index fhewing the Degrees 
falls upon 00 Deg. 00 Min. 00 Seconds ; fo that the fame Star may then appear through 
the Telefcope in one and the fame place, both by the direct Rays, and by the reflected 
ones i but if the Index be turned, the Star fhall alfo appear in two places, whofe Diflance is 
mewed on the Brafs Limb by the Index. 

The Ufe of this Inftrument. 

By this Inftrument the Diflance of the Moon from any fixed Star is thus obferved : view 
the Star through the Telefcope by the direct Light, and the Moon by the reflected Light, or 
the contrary, and turn the Index 'rill the Star appears to touch the Edge of the Moon, and 
the Index will fhew upon the Brafs graduated Arch of the Inftrument, the Diflance of the 
Star from the Limb of the Moon ; and though the Inftrument fhakes by the Motion of your 
Ship at Sea, yet the Moon and Star will move together as if they did really touch one 

another 



Of modern Inftruments ufed at Sea ', &amp;c, 269 

another in the Heavens, fo that an Obfervation may be made as exactly at Sea as at Land ; and 
by the fame Inftrument may be obfervcd exactly the Altitudes of the Moon and Stars by 
bringing them to the Horizon, and thereby the Latitude and Times of Obfervations may be, 
determined more exactly than by the Ways now in Ufe. Note, In the Time of the Obferva- 
tion, if the Inftrument moves angularly about the Axis of the Telefcope, the Star will move 
in a Tangent of the Moon's Limb, or of the Horizon ; but the Obfervation may notwith- 
standing be made exactly, by noting when the Line defcribed by the Star is a Tangent to 
the Moon's Limb, or to the Horizon-, and to make the Inftrument ufeful, the Telefcope 
ought to take in a large Angle •, and to make the Obfervation true, the Star muft touch the 
Moon's Limb, not on the outfide of the Limb, but on the infide : thus far Sir Ifaac 
'Newton. 

TJbe Defcription and Ufe of Mr Had ley V Inftrument for taking the Latitude, or other 

Altitudes at Sea. 

The Inftrument ABC (Fig. 6.) is an Octant having it's Arch or Limb C B but 45 De- Fig. 6, 
grees diagonally divided into 90 equal Parts, and thefe again fubdivided into as many 
equal Parts as poffible with diftinction ; each of the firft mentioned equal Parts being De- 
grees, and the fubdivifions Parts of a Degree, as ferve to take any Altitude from the Hori- 
zon to the Zenith. The Octant is generally made of Mahogany Wood, and fometimes of 
Ebony, or Brafs, the Radius of the Inftrument being generally 20 Inches •, the Thicknefs is 
half an Inch ; the graduated Arch is ufually of Box- Wood, and fometimes Brafs about the 
Thicknefs of a Half-penny. About the Centre of the Inftrument there is an Index D, 
freely but ftiffly moving on a Pin, fhewing the Degrees upon the Arch. Upon this Index* 
near the Centre, is fixed a plane Speculum E, or piece of Looking-Glafs Quick-filvered 
on one fide, having it's middle E directly over the Centre of the Octant, which Speculum 
is perpendicular to the Plane of the Index, and whofe Plane coincides with the fiducial 
Line E D drawn along the middle of the Index : though it may make fome Angle with 
that Line in other Inftruments of this kind. This Speculum is about 2 Inches by 2 '. 
This Glafs is to receive the firft Image of the Sun, or other Object to be obferved by, and 
to reflect it to another lefler plane Speculum, or Looking-Glafs F, % of an Inch fquare, 
fixed perpendicularly on a piece of Wood faftened to the Side A B, or Limb of the Octant, 
and having it's Surface fo fituated, that when the Index is brought to mark the Beginning 
of the Divifions on the Limb (that is o°), it may be exactly parallel to the Surface of the 
other Speculum. That part of this Speculum is Quick-filvered which is next to the Plane 
of the Inftrument, and fo fet in it's Brafs Work, that it may at any time be fee perpendi- 
cular to the Plane of the Inftrument, if by any accident it fhould be removed from that 
pofture. When it is in the Perpendicular, it can alfo be turned round, keeping ftill perpendi- 
cular, fo as at pleafure to bring it to it's true pofition with regard to the Glafs fixed on the 
Index. This Glafs ferves for forward Obfervations with the Inftrument, and from it the 
Eye receives the Image of the Object by a fecond Reflection. There is another fuch Specu- 
lum G placed on the fide of the Octant, but farther from the Centre, and with the fame 
Sort of Brafs Work to fet it perpendicular, and to it's true Pofition. 

There are two dark or fmoaked GlafTes H, fet in Frames of Brafs fixed to a Pin, the 
one lighter, and the other darker, fo as to be turned at pleafure either of them, or both 
together, as the Sun's brightnefs may require between the Speculum on the Index, and 
either of the two on the fide of the Inftrument, according as the fore or back Obfervation 
is ufed. For which reafon there are two Holes on the fide of the Inftrument, that they ac- 
cordingly may be fhifted from the one to the other. I being the Hole for them in the back 
Obfervation. Each of the Obfervations has a fight Vane K, of Box- Wood, about 2 f 
Inches from the Centre. In that for the fore Obfervation are made two Holes to direct the 
placing the Eye, the one being exactly as high above the Plane of the Inftrument as is the 
middle of the unquickfilvered Part of the leffer Glafs j the other the Height of the Edge of 
the Quick- filver itfelf, or a little lower. That for the back Obfervation requires but one 
Hole, which is placed exactly at the Height of the middle of the clear Part of that Glafs. 
The Altitude of the Sun or Star above the Horizon, taken by this Inftrument, is deter- 
mined by the Inclination of the Planes of the two GlafTes (F and E for the fore Obfervation, 
and F and G for the back Obfervation) to each other, when the Sun or Star appears in the 
Horizon. In the fore Obfervation, the double of this Angle of Obfervation is the Alti- 
tude fought, and is marked by the Index, on the Arch of the Inftrument divided into half 
Degrees. But in the back Obfervation, twice the Difference of this Inclination from a right 
Angle gives the fame Altitude, and is marked by the Index in the fame manner, the fame 
Scale of Degrees ftrving for both ; fo that when the Index ftands at the beginning of the 
Scale, the Surface of the leffer Glafs F ufed for the fore Obfervation, is parallel to the 
Surface of that one the Index, viz. E, but the Surface of the other Glafs G perpendicu- 



lar to it. 



4 A The 



70 Of modern Inftruments ufe a I at Sea ', &amp;c. 

The Ufe of this refetfing Oft ant as thus defcribed, in taking the Altitude of the Sun, 

or a Star at Sea. 

I. To adjuft the Glafs for a fore Obfervation. 

Set the Index D exactly to the Beginning of the Scale C, that is, clofe up to the Button 
on the Side of the Limb AC. Then holding the Inftrument with your Left-hand, by 
the Index and Limb together, near the Arch B C, or over the Button, as upright as you 
can with the Arch downwards, and keeping the Index all the while touching the Button, 
look thro' the lower Hole in the Sight-Vane, that is, that next to the Inftrument, and fee 
the Edge of the Sea (taken for the Horizon), through the Part of the Glafs which does 
not reflect, and mark whether the Line of the Sea's Edge, that is, the Horizon thus feen 
by direct vifion coincides, or is the fame, with the fame Edge feen by the Reflection of 
the Quick-filvered part of that Glafs. If not, turn that Glafs by the Handle on the back 
fide of the Inftrument, 'till they do thus join or coincide. This being done, 

II. To take an Altitude by a fore Obfervation. 

Set the Index to the Altitude as near as you can judge, if it be within 10 or 15 Degrees 
the Matter is not much. Hold the Inftrument upright, as near as poflible, with it's Plane 
in a vertical Circle palling through the Zenith and Sun, or other Object, with the Arch 
downwards. And fuppofing the Object to be the Sun, placing your Eye at the upper Hole 
of the Sight- Vane K. Look at the Edge of the Sea (taken for the Horizon), juft under the 
Sun by direct view, through the outer Part of the Speculum on the Limb not Quick- 
filvered over. Then by moving the Index, the Image of the Sun muft be brought to ap- 
pear as if it were really joined to the Edge of the Sea, that is, as if it were brought down 
to the Horizon, touching it where the vertical Circle pafling through the Zenith and Centre 
of the Sun cuts the Horizon, and the Degrees and Minutes of the Arch marked by the 
Index will denote the Sun's Altitude. 

Note, If the Reflection be too bright for the Eye, turn up one or both the coloured 
GlafTes H, according as you fee occafion. But if the Image be too faint to appear on this 
Part of the Glafs, or it be any other Object than the Sun, or a bright Moon, then look 
through the lower Hole of the Vane, and fee it on the Quick-filvered part of the Specu- 
lum, and then you muft judge when the Line of the Horizon, feen directly through the 
unquick-filvered part if produced, would pafs through it. 

Note alfo the Line of the Direction of the Sight, or the Line in which you fee the Image 
when directly looking at it, muft be kept as near as poflible parallel to the Plane of the 
Inftrument, in order to be very exact. Wherefore when you look through the upper 
Hole, take the Obfervation about the middle of the unquick-filvered Part of the Glafs, 
and not too near the Edge of the Quick- filver, nor the outer Edge of the Glafs ; but, if 
you ufe the under Hole, bring the Image near the Edge of the Quick-filver, lean the In- 
ftrument a little awry to right and left by turns, by which the Image will feem to fwing 
to and fro, and move the Index 'till you have brought the Image juft to brufh the Ho- 
rizon in the loweft Part of it's fwing. 

Note, For common ufe it will be well enough to obferve by the Sun's Centre. But this 
way is not fo exact, as to do it by the Sun's upper or under Edge -, if the under Edge 
be ufed, in the fore Obfervation, you muft add 16 Minutes to thofe pointed by the Index; 
if the upper, fubftract 16 Minutes. 

To adjuft the Glaffes for the back Obfervation. 

Set the Index off fo much before the beginning of the Scale of Degrees as is the double 
of the Dip of the Horizon, or Edge of the Sea (viz. 8 Minutes, for 44 Feet above the 
Surface of the Sea •, y / for 34 Feet ; 6' for 25 ; cj for 17 Feet ; 4/ for 1 1 Feet ; 3' for 6 
Feet ; and i / for 3 Feet). Look through the Hole of that Sight- Vane holding the Inftru- 
ment upright, and fee that the Edge of the Sea behind you, appearing by reflection either 
from the clear Part of that Glafs, if it be difcernable there, or elfe from the Quick-filver 
on both fides ; join all along with that before you, feen through the fame clear Part of the 
Glafs. If thofe two Edges crofs one another, the Inftrument is not held upright, and the 
Adjuftment will not be fo certain. 

Note, The Edge of the Sea feen by reflection will be inverted ; the Water appearing 
above, and the Sky below. 

To take an Altitude by a back Obfervation. 

Having fet the Index to the Altitude as near as you can guefs, look through the Hole in 
the Sight-Vane, and the middle of the clear Part of that Glafs between the Quick-filvered 
Parts on both Edges, juft over your own Shadow, and move the Index 'till you bring the 

Image 



Of modern Inftruments ufed 4t Sea^ &amp;c. 271 

Ima»e of the Sun, &amp;c. exactly to the Horizon ; and the Degrees and Minutes marked on 
the graduated Arch will be the Altitude fought. 

Note, To know whether you hold the Inftrument upright, carry it to Right and Left by 
turns, keeping your Arms fteady, and you will fee the Image flide along the Edge of the 
Sea, if it be held upright •, otherwife it will run in a Line cutting it. In this Obltrvation, 
if you ufe the apparent under Edge of the Sun, fubftract 1 6 Minutes, otherwife add 16 
Minutes, contrary to what is to be done in the fore Obfervation. 

Note, The Dip of the Horizon fet down above, in the back Obfervation, is to be added 
to the Degrees of Altitude marked upon the Arch, and not fubftracted as in the fore 
Obfervation. 

To obferve the Altitude of a Star, by the fore Obfervation. 

Look directly up at it firft with the Index (landing clofe to the Button, then move the 
Jndex forwards, and caufe the Star to flide down to the Horizon, that you may not mi- 
ftake it for another ; and the Degrees marked by the Index will be that Star's Altitude ; 
and thus is the Altitude of a Star taken by the fore Obfervation. But when the Horizon is 
bright, and the Star faint, it may be bell to take the Altitude by a back Obfervation •, in 
which cafe you are to look directly up at the Star, and bring the Horizon, or Edge of the 
Sea, behind you to touch the Star by reflection. As the Stars are ufed in the Night, Moon- 
light Nights are beft for the Obfervation, either fore or back. 

Note, The back Obfervation is not fo eafy as the fore one, and is ufe fill in taking fmall 
Altitudes of the Sun when it's Light may be troublefome to the Eye in the fore Obferva- 
tion. It is alfo ufeful in verifying the Truth of an Altitude of the fame Object, taken at 
the fame time, or nearly fo, by a fore Obfervation with the fame Instrument. That the 
back and fore Obfervation may agree accurately, in a lofty Ship efpecially, the Index muft 
not ftand exactly at the beginning of the Scale in the Adjuftment for the fore Obfervation, 
but muft be fet off fo much before the beginning of the Scale, as has been already faid, as 
is the double of the Angle of the Dip or the vifible Horizon, or Edge of the Sea, below 
the true Horizon, for which reafon there is a few Minutes graduated before the beginning 
of the Arch. 

The chief Advantage of this Inftrument, fays Mr Hadley, confifts in this ; that whereas 
by taking an Altitude by other Inftruments now in ufe, a certain exact Pofture of them is 
required. But the Motion of the Ship continually difturbs the Obferver, by putting them 
out of that true Pofture, even in moderate Weather, and in hollow Seas to that degree, 
that Obfervations taken by them cannot oftentimes be accurate enough to be depended up- 
on. But with this Inftrument, though the Ship rolls ever fo much, provided the Inftru- 
ment be kept in, or near, an upright Pofture, though it be leaned forewards or backwards 
therein, yet the Image of any Object, when once brought by Aiding the Index to appear on 
the Edge of the Sea, will there remain abfolutely immovable, as long as the Index con- 
tinues in the fame Place, without being ftirred, and the Obferver has the fame Advantage 
of making the Obfervation as if he took it in fmooth Water, and the Inftrument was held 
flill without Motion. Thus far Mr Hadley. 

Hence it is evident from what has been faid, that whatever Improvement as to the Ufe 
and Exactnefs of thefe Inftrum«nts others may have found out, whether by the Matter, Fi- 
gure, Weight, alteration of fome Parts, He. Sir Ifaac Newton moft certainly muft have 
the Honour of the Invention. All the Praife due to others, can only confift in the Degree 
of Facility of the Ufe, and the Exactnefs, whereby the Inftrument, as contrived by them, 
exceeds that defcribed by Sir Ifaac Newton •, and, indeed, whatever this be, Sir Ifaac New- 
ton at leaft muft have been the original Caufe •, for had he not fhewn this his Invention to 
Dr Halley, it is probable that Nobody elfe might have thought of fuch a Contrivance, and 
confequently there would have been no fuch Inftrument, and accordingly no Improvement 
upon it. Or fuppofing fomebody elfe to have thought of fuch a Contrivance by himfelf, 
as well as Sir Ifaac Newton -, yet as Sir Ifaac appears to have been the firft Inventor, this 
other Inventor is allowed to have no fhare of the Honour of the Invention, and much lefs 
ftiould thofe who only alter or improve fome particular Part or Parts of the original In- 
vention ; perhaps (more to difguife and diftinguifh it from that of others, thereby the 
better to appropriate the whole to themfelves) than render the original Invention more per- 
fect and better fuiting the Defign of the original Thing itfelf. He who alters the Situation 
of a Door, Window, Chimney, or other lefler Part in a commodious well defigned Build- 
ing, has but a fmall Title to any of the Reputation acquired by the Architect of that Build- 
ing. Columbus, who firft difcovered the JVefl-Indies, is juftly allowed by all to have the 
Honour of the Difcovery, although Americus Vefputius, who failed there after him, had the 
Reputation to have that Country called by his Name. So Mr Hadley's and Mr Smith's 
Quadrants, though they do not differ from that of Sir Ifaac Newton as to the Main of the 
Invention, yet thefe Inftruments are called by their Names. 

The Inconveniences in the Ufe of this Inftrument feem to be, 1 ft, For him who wants to 
find the Altitude of the Sun by that Inftrument, firft to guefs at that Altitude without fuch 
Inftrument, at leaft within 10 or 15 Degrees, which is not eafy to do -by one who is not

much ufed to the taking of Altitudes. Secondly, The too great Obfcurity of the Objects 
when feen by a double Reflection, efpecially in hazy Weather. Thirdly, The uncertainrv 
of feeing the true Horizon in hazy Weather or at Nights. Fourthly, The uncertainty of 
bringing a Star to the true Horizon in the Night, even when the Moon fhines. The Hori- 
zon being then not eafily to be guefifed at, there being Vapours oftentimes on the Surface 
of the Sea caufing the Refraction to be ibmetimes more and fometimes lefs according to the 
Weather, Time of the Year, &amp;c. fo unconftantly various, that no Rule, or Tables, "by any 
one hitherto given for determining it's Quantity, can be entirely depended upon. f!y which 
means the true Horizon, as to Situation, will fometimes appear higher or lower through an 
Inflrument looking at it, that is, at the Line feperating the apparent Surface of the Sea 
from the Sky. And that according as the Medium that he looks at it through, is more or 
lefs denfe, or the Mercury in the Barometer is higher or lower. For all which Reafons I 
am apt to think that this Newtonian Quadrant or Otlant, is fubject to uncertainty with re- 
gard to the Practice, as well as all the others that have been hitherto invented. But how 
far this Inflrument exceeds any of them, it is not in my Power to fay. Experience, and 
that a good deal, fufficient Judgment, and proper Caution, are the beft Proofs. This may 
have the Advantage of fome of them in fome Particulars, and they of this in others. This 
I am certain, when the Sun is bright and the vifible Horizon clear, the Altitude, all things 
elfe alike, will be beft taken by this Inflrument. But in the Night when the Moon does not 
mine, the meridian Altitude of a noted Star, as the Pole Star, which is chiefly wanted in or- 
der to find the Latitude, cannot be taken fo exactly by this Inflrument, becaufe the Horizon 
cannot be diflinctly feen, as it can by a Brafs Aftrolabe, or Ring, properly poifed by a dex- 
terous Perfon, who has been ufed to all the various Motions of a Ship, and where the 
fenfible Horizon has nothing to do with the Operation. Befidcs, the Divifions of the De- 
grees upon this Aftrolabe, are twice as big as thofe upon one of thefe Octants of the fame 
Radius, which muff, certainly be fome advantage. Moreover, as there are but few who 
ufe this Octant who know the Reafon why it gives the Altitude that they are finding by it, 
but, on the contrary, every body who underftands the firft Rudiments of Aftronomy and 
Geography, immediately fees the Reafon of his Operation by the Aftrolabe ; the latter has 
fome advantage over the former upon this account, viz. with refpect to flmplicity. And 
this flmplicity may be a Means to bring this Aftrolabe more in ufe than it is at prelcnt, and 
I think fhould ftir up fome impartial, ingenious Perfons to compare the Ufes of the two 
Inftruments, which are beft, and if the Aftrolabe be deficient herein, to render it more per- 
fect by fome additional Contrivances, which I think it is capable of. Ttlefcopick Sights to 
the Index might be of ufe; and if the Wind fhould be fo high as to ditturbe the true 
poifing of the Inflrument, this may alfo be remedied In fhort, of all the Inftruments for 
taking the Altitudes at Sea, this mod ingenious Octant, as to contrivance, and that molt 
Ample one the Aftrolabe, I take to be the beft of any others. 

The Foundation of the Contrivance of the Newtonian Offant, is chiefly built upon the 
following Caloptrical Principles". 1. The Angle of Reflection is equal to the Angle of Inci- 
dence. 2. The Place of the Image of an Object, feen by the Reflection of a plane Specu- 
lum, will be behind the Speculum in a Perpendicular let fall from that Object, and as far 
behind the Speculum as that Object is before the Speculum (the Objects are fuppofed to be 
Points for the eafe of Imagination). 3dly, The Image of an Object feen by the fucceflive 
Reflections of one or more plane Speculums, will be feen in the fecond reflected Ray, by an 
Eye any where placed in that Ray, provided the Speculums themfelves do not hinder the 
Sight. Hence, 
Fig. 7 . If two plane Speculums b B, c C (Fig. 7.) inclined to one another under the Angle H R I, 

be at right Angles to fome third Plane MAN, as fuppofe that of the Horizon M A N. 
And if a Ray of Light A F emitted from any Point A of an Object, be fuccefllvely re- 
flected by thofe two plane Speculums (that is, by the Speculum b B from F to G, and by 
the Speculum c C from G through L, the Angle A F B being equal to ^FG, and the 
Angle C G F equal to the Angle c G L) •, the firft Image of A being at M, as far behind 
the Continuation of the common Section R H of the Speculum b B and the Horizon, as A 
is before it ; and the fecond Image N made by the Reflection of the fecond Speculum c C, 
as far beyond the Continuation R I of the common Section of the Plane of the fecond Spe- 
culum c C, as the Image M is on this Side of it. I fay, the three Points R, M, N, will be 
at the fame Diftance from the common Section R of the Planes of the two Speculums with 
the horizontal Plane. And the Angle A R N contained under the two right Lines A R, 
N R, drawn from the Object A, and it's fecond Image N, to the faid common Section R, 
will be the double of the Angle H R I of the Inclination of the Planes of the two Spe- 
culums b B, rC, viz. their common Sections with the Plane of the Florizon. 

For draw R A, join AM, M N, cutting R H, R I, in the Points P and S. Alfo let 
N G, A F, continued out, meet in L ; then flnce all Reflection is made in the fame Plane, 
with the incident Rays, the Points R, L, M, A, N, F, G, will be all in the fame Plane, 
viz. that of the Florizon, now becaufe PM-P A, and P F — P F, ami the A ngle A F 1 i 
= RFG=MFH; the Triangles F M P, F A P will be equal to one another ; where- 
fore F M = F A, and the Angle M F A will be twice the Angle A F H — M F H, and fo 



Of modern Inftruments ufed at Sea , &amp;c. ^^ 

the Arch A M — 2 Arch A II, or = 2 Arch M H. In like manner, fince the Angle 
M G C = Angle L G R = N G I, and M S -- S N, and G S = G S, therefore will the Tri- 
angles G M S, G N S be equal ; wherefore G M = G N, and the Angle M G N = 2 Angle 
N G I ~ I G M, therefore the Arch MN= 2 IM = 2lN. Hence the Triangles R M F* 
R AF will be equal, and lo R M = R A ; alio the Triangles R M G, R N G will be equal 
to one another, wherefore R M = R A =-- R N = R I. 

Again, make the Angle I R Q = I R H, oT the Arch I G, I Qj= I H, then will Q^H = 
2 I Q^ But QH = A N, for fince N Qj= M H = A H. If A Q^ be added to N Q^, and 
A H be added to N Q , there will be had A N = QJH •, wherefore A N = 2 H I, or the 
Angle A R N = 2 H R I. 

Alfo the Angle NLA will be equal to the Angle N R A, and fo the four Points A, N, 
R, L, will be all in one and the fame Circle. For fince the Angles ALN j- G F L — F G 
N, and fo A L N = F G N — G F L. But F G N = 2 F G I, and G F L = 2 G F R, and 
confequently their Difference is ~ 2 F R G = 2 H R I, wherefore the Points A, N, R, L 
will be in the Circumference of the fame Circle, the Angle NLA being equal to the An- 
gle N R A. Hence, if the Eye be placed at L, in the fecond reflected Ray NGL, the 
Image N of the Point A of a vifible Object will appear to be at N, fuppofing the Part c G 
of the Speculum c C to be away, viz. not hindering the Sight, or contrariwife, if N be a 
vifible Point of an Object, the Eye at L will fee it's Image at A ; if the Part b F of the 
firft Speculum be away, fo as not to hinder the direct Progrefs of the Rays AFL coming 
from A to L. Since the Radius AR of the Horizon MAN (or, indeed, of any great 
Circle in the Heavens), is infinite, the Points R, L, G, will coincide, or fall into one an- 
other ; and in this Cafe, the Arch A N of the Horizon contained between the vifible Point 
A, and it's fecond Image N, will be exactly equal to one half the Arch H I of the Angle 
of the Inclination of the two Speculums b B, c C, to one another. Hence, if M A N be 
the Meridian, and A be a Point where that Meridian cuts the Florizon, and if N be fup- 
pofed to be the Sun, in the Meridian, elevated above the Horizon by the angular Diftance, 
or Arch A K N. If thefe two Speculums b B, c C be fo inclined to one another, that the 
Image of the Sun N, appears to the Eye at R or L, by the Reflection of the Speculums to 
be caff upon the Point A of the Horizon. Twice the Angle of the Inclination of the Spe- 
culums will be equal to the Sun's Meridian Altitude AN ; and this is the main Foundation 
of the whole Contrivance of all thefe new Sorts of reflecting Sea Octants for the fore Obferva- 
tion. See a more particular Account of this Theory by Mr Hadley himfelf, in the Pbilcfo- 
phical TranfaHions, Numb. 420, 425 ; as alfo in Dr Smith's Opticks. 

And the Reafon of the Operation for a back Obfervation is derived from this Theorem^ 
viz. twice the Difference of this Angle of Inclination of the Planes of the two Speculums, 
from a right Angle, is the Angle A R N of Altitude. 

Mr Hadley tells us, that upon Trial of one of thefe Inftruments, three Obfervations made 
at Sea of the Diftance between two Stars with a Brafs Octant of this Kind, differed from 
Mr Flamjiead's at Land, only about a Minute ; and a dozen Obfervations of the Sun's Alti- 
tudes taken by one of thefe wooden Inftruments, differed but about half a Minute at a Me- 
dium from one another, when the Ship lay at Anchor ; and when the Ship was under Sail, 
another dozen differed at a Medium about a Minute. He tells us moreover, the Obferva- 
tions made of this Inftrument at Sea, were by the Help of fome curious Watches, with 
Second Hands, and from the Time by the Watch corrected, noted at the Inftant of each 
Obfervation, the true apparent Altitude of the Sun was computed, the Refraction, and Ob- 
ferver's Elevation being allowed for, and the Difference between the Altitude thus found by 
Computation, and what was given by the Inftrument at the fame Time, gives the Error of 
the Altitude found by the Inftrument. And he afterwards fays, that a Meridian Altitude 
may be taken at Sea to a Minute, by this Inftrument, which I much doubt •, for as a Mi- 
nute of the Arch of the wooden Octant of 22 Inches Radius, is but about 5 Parts of 200 of 
an Inch, which is but a very fmall Interval, and as thefe fmall Divifions by Workmen are 
oftentimes not made equal between themfelves, I think it is too much to fay, an Angle can 
be taken to one Minute, much lefs to half a Minute by fuch an Inftrument, even fuppofing 
there were no other material Caufes of Error in the Way. If I fhould affert that an Alti- 
tude could not be taken truly at Sea to 2 Minutes by the Inftrument, I do not know whe- 
ther I might not be right. For Mr Hadley* s Computation of the Altitude is fubject to 
fome Error, becaufe, as he himfelf owns, an Error of feven Seconds in the Time, will caufe 
an Error of one Minute in the Altitude, alfo an Error of the Sun's Declination at the Time 
of Obfervation, as alfo one in the Latitude of the Place, for both thefe muft be given, to- 
gether with the exact Time from Noon. In order to compute the Altitude from Spherical 
Trigonometry by the Tables of Sines and Tangents, that is, to find one Side of a Spheri- 
cal Triangle when the Angle oppofite to it (viz. the Time, and the other two Sides, in- 
cluding that Angle, the one being the Complement of the Latitude, and the other the Com- 
plement of the Sun's Declination), are all three given. I fay, an Error in either of thefe, 
will caufe one in the Altitude thus found by Trigonometrical Calculation, for which reafon 
I am not certain, whether the Goodnefs of one of thefe Octants might not be better tried 
by a number of Perfons in the fame Ship, near the Shore, each with one of thefe Inftra-

ments taking the Sun's Altitude at the fame Time, and other Perfons on the Slime, near at 
Hand at the fame Time, by ibme Signal, taking that fame Altitude with fome proper In- 
ftruments ; then by comparing the Sea Obfervations of that Altitude, with the Land ones 
taken at the fame Time, their agreement, or difference at a Medium, after all proper 
Allowances are made, will fhew the Exactnefs of the Octant in taking Altitudes of the Sun 
at Sea. And for greater Certainty of Exactnefs, that Altitude may be calculated too, by 
Spherical Trigonometry. By having given the Latitude, and Sun's Declination, as alio the 
Surfs Azimuth found at the Time of Obfervation, by a good Azimuth Compafs, r ther 
than the Time from Noon, given by a Watclu an Error in the Azimuth caufing lefs Error 
in the computed Altitude. Then if the Larfsl? .Altitude, Sea Altitude, and computed Alti- 
tude all agree, to a Trifle, we may be a flu red of the Certainty of the Altitude taken at 
Sea. But when the Land Altitude and computed one agree, and the Sea Altitude differs 
too much from them, there is an Error in the Sea Altitude taken. 




CHAP. III. 

The Defcription of another modern Quadrant of Mr Elton's for taking 
Altitudes without an Horizon^ either at Sea or Land* 

Fig. S. rr~\ HIS Inftrument (Fig. 8.) confifts of four principal Parts, viz. the Frame ABCD 

J[ E F, the Index G H, a Label I K, and a Shield or Ray Plate dfg ; and thefe confift 
of feveral Parts : the Frame has two Parts, the one a gradt rtco Arch D E, of 30 Degrees, 
each Degree fubdivided into 6 equal Parts ; the other B C, a Chord of an Arch of 60 De- 
grees, divided into two equal Parts. At the Extremities, and in the Middle of which are 
three Holes, or Stops, a, b, c, for the Label. The Index G PI turns, about the Centre of 
the Frame, through the whole Extent of the Arch, and has three Parts, a Nonius Plate «, 
Eye- Vane v, and Glafs Tube t, as a Spirit Level ; the Nonius Plate moves with the Index, 
and fubdivides each of the fmall Divifions into ten equal Parts or Minutes ; the Eye- Vane v, 
is to look through in a fore Obfervation, and the Glafs Tube / is to fhew by the Bubble of 
Air when the Index is horizontal ; the Label I K moves about the Centre of the Frame, 
the whole Extent of the Chord B C of the Arch of 60 Degrees ; having three fixed Stations 
thereon at 30 Degrees, 60 Degrees, and 90 Degrees, and contains two principal Parts, viz. 
a Lens /, and a Stool 0, for a Lanthorn Qj the Lens is to form the Sun's Image upon the 
Shield dfg, the Lanthorn is neceffary in nocturnal Obfervations, the Shield is fixed in the 
Centre of the Frame, and has three Parts ; an Azimuth Tube z, an Axis x, and an hori- 
zontal Tube / ; or in backward Obfervations a ray Plate ; the Hole in the Shield is to re- 
ceive the Sun's Image, the Azimuth Tube is to direct the Plane of the Inftrument perpen- 
dicular to the Florizon, the horizontal Tube is to fhew when the Label is level, the Axis is 
to cut the Objects in forward Obfervations. 

The Ufe of the Inftrument, for either a backward or forward Obfervation. 

If the Altitude does not exceed 30 Degrees, the Label muft be placed at the Station on 
the Radius or longeft Limb of the Quadrant. If the Altitude be between 30 and 60 De- 
grees, at the middle Station ; and if the Altitude exceeds 60 Degrees, at the uppermoft 
Station. 

To take the Sun's Altitude by a back Obfervation. 

In doing this, the Sight- Vane, or horizontal Tube, on the Shield is not ufed. Hold the 
Quadrant with both Hands fo as to keep it as fteady as poffible, with the back Arch turned 
towards the Sun. When the Bubble of the Azimuth Tube is brought under the Hole in the 
Shield, caufe the Sun's Image to fall on the Hole in the Shield, fo that it may reft in the 
Centre of the Sun's Image ; the Inftant the Azimuth Tube and the Sun's Image are thus re- 
gulated, fee if the Bubble in the horizontal Tube on the Index (which 'till then is difregard- 
cd) leaves the open End of the Tube, or ftops any where clear of the Ends of the Tube. 
If thefe happen at the fame Time, the Altitude is then truly taken. But if the Bubble had 
remained in the enclofed End of the Tube, when the Azimuth Bubble and Sun's Image 
were regulated, the Index muft have been flid up ; and if it ftaid in the open End, moved 
down 'till the horizontal Bubble on the Index quits the open End of the Tube, or ftopt 
between the Ends, as was before obferved ; and then is the Quadrant ftt. In continuing 



Some Account of the Mural Quadrant \ &amp;C. 275 

the Obfcrvation for a Meridian Altitude, the Quadrant being fet, as the Sun rifes, the ho- 
rizontal Bubble on the Index will not quit the open End of the Tube, or flop between the 
Ends, but hang there, or leave it after the Azimuth Bubble and Sun's Image have been 
regulated, which will require the Index to be continually moved down in order to keep the 
Quadrant fet ; when the Sun is up, or on the Meridian, the Quadrant will remain fet for 
fome time ; and on the Sun's falling, the horizontal Bubble will have a reverfe Tendency, 
inclining or running wholly to the enclofed End of the Tube. 

To take the Altitude of the Sun or Stars by a forward Obfervation. 
In this Obfervation the Lens and Tube, on the Index are not ufed. Hold the Quadrant 
upright, and looking through the Eye-Vane direct the Axis, or upper End of the Shield, 
to the Sun or Star. If the Axis cuts the Sun or Star at the fame lnftant that the Bubble 
on the horizontal Tube on the Shield quits the open End, the Altitude is then truely taken, 
and the Quadrant ftt. .But if it fhould leave the open End of the Tube before the Axis, 
or upper Edge of the Shield, cuts the Sun or Star, then the Eye- Vane, or the Index, muft 
be Aid down •, and if it remains at the open End, or quits it when the Axis is above, the 
Sun or Star moved up until the Quadrant is fet. In continuing the Obfervation for a me- 
ridian Altitude, as the Sun or Star rifes, the Bubble in the horizontal Tube will always 
quit the open End of the Tube before the Axis cuts the Horizon •, fo that to keep the 
Quadrant lit, the Eye- Vane muff on every fuch alteration be conflantly moved down •, 
while the Sun or Star is upon the Meridian, the Quadrant will remain fet; and when the Sun 
or Star falls, the Bubble will act contrary to what it did in the rifing, .refling wholly in the 
open End of the Tube. 

To take the Sun's Altitude by means of the Horizon. 

Turn the back of the Arch towards the Sun, and caufe the Sun's Image to fall on the 
Hole in the Shield, at the fame Time looking through the Eye- Vane, to cut the Horizon 
with the Axis. 

Note, In taking the Altitude of the Stars, a fmall Light mufl be fixed in the Lanthorn ; 
the lefs the better. It will be be ft in forward Obfervations of the Sun, to take the Altitude 
of the upper Limb, and then fubftract ; and when the Sun is very clear, take his Altitude 
by a backward Obfervation, the forward way being chiefly intended for nocturnal Obfer- 
vations, and when the Sun is too much obfeured to give any Shade or Image. 

In the Philofophical Tranj actions, at Number 423, pag. 273, from whence the afore- 
mentioned Defcription and Ufe 0! this Quadrant is taken, you have an Account how near 
Altitudes of the Sun taken at Sea by this Infirument, in a Voyage to Maryland, agreed with 
the Altitudes of the Sun taken at the fame Time by Davis's Quadrant. Sometimes they 
differed only one Minute, fometimes cf or 6', fometimes 16', and once their greateft Dif- 
ference was 21 Minutes. In the fame Place, it is faid, that Obfervations of the Altitudes 
of the fixed Scars taken by both the Inflruments, and the Latitude found thereby, common- 
ly differed about 4/ or 5', and the greateft Difference once arofe to 13'. Moreover, the 
•Captain of the Veffel that went to Maryland declares, that he obferved with his Quadrant 
of Mr Elton's both by the Sun and Stars, in all the various Sorts of Weather he met with 
in his Voyage to and from Maryland, without regarding the Horizon, with as great Ex- 
actnefs as with Davis's Quadrant when the Sun and Horizon were clear. Laftly, It is faid 
that another Sea Captain computed the Latitude in Leghorn Road, and feveral of the Ports of 
Spain, from Obfervations by this Quadrant, exactly agreeing with the known Latitudes of 
thofe Places. He adds, that he made feveral Obfervations by the Infirument in his PafTage 
home in hard Gales and a great Sea, and when it was fo hazy that the common Quadrant 
was of no ufe for want of the Horizon. 

Hence we may briefly obferve upon this Infirument, that it is no better than Davis's 
Quadrant, at leafl thefe two Captains thought fo, or elfe they would not have ufed Davis's 
as the Standard of Exactnefs, whereby to compare the others in their Voyages. At moft 
it can only exceed Davis's in hazy Weather, and Obfervations of the fixed Stars at Night, 
when the Horizon cannot be feen. 



CHAP. IV. 

Some Account of the great Mural Quadrant at the Royal Obfervatory 

in Greenwich Park, 

THIS Quadrant chiefly confifls of {freight Iron Bars, crofs-ways joined together (as Plate 2, 
appears in the Figure) flat-ways and edge-ways, the Breadth of each of which is 2 Fig ?o 
Inches and 9 Tenths, and the Thicknefs T 'o and 4 nearly -, all thofe that are edge- ways being 

* behind 



276 Same Account of the Mural Quadrant -, &amp;c. 

behind die others. They are fo placed to ftrengthen them the more, and are befides far- 
ther flrengthened by a great Number of fhort Iron Plates bent to a right Angle, and placed 
behind the Quadrant in the Angles made by the Bars, and riveted to them both. Behind 
at the Circumlerence of the Quadrant there is alio a Bar placed edge-ways, bent circular, and 
faftened all along the middle of the flat Arch or Limb of the Quadrant, by a furficient 
Number of little Iron Plates bent at right Angles. 

The Arch or Limb of the Quadrant con fills of two (every ways) equal quadrantal Arches 
laid upon one another ; an Iron one behind, and a Brafs one before ; the Breadth of each 
being 3 Inches and 4. Tenths ; and the common Part of their Breadths where they lie doubled 
one over the other and are riveted together, is 2 Inches and 2 Tenths •, the Brafs Limb be- 
ing remoter from the Center, than the Iron one by 1 Inch and 2 Tenths. This Limb is re- 
duced to a true Plane, by firft placing the flat of the Quadrant very firm upon a Level or 
Horizontal Plane, and erecting perpendicularly over it's Center an Iron Axis, to the Bottom 
of which Axis is fixed at right Angles, an Iron Arm, equal in Length to the Radius of 
the Quadrant, and to the other End of this Arm is fixed an Iron Scraper directly over the 
Brafs Limb, and being firmly fupported by the Arm and it's Braces, was turned about the 
aforefaid Axis, 'till by fcraping the Brafs, the Surface of it was reduced to a perfect Plane- 
the Edge of the Scraper being exactly perpendicular to the Axis of it's Motion. 

Upon the Brafs Limb, there are two Arches ftruck, one with a Radius of 96.85 Inches 
and the other with a Radius of 95.8 Inches, by a Beam-Compafs, fecured from bending 
by fcveral Braces faftened to it; the inner Arch is divided into Degrees, and 12th Parts of 
a Degree •, and the outward Arch into 96 equal Parts, each of which are fubdivided into 16 
equal Parts. Thefe Divifions were made by bifecting every one of the equal Arches of 
30 Degrees of the Quadrant, whereby the fame became divided into 6 equal Parts, con- 
taining 15 Degrees apiece, and each of thefe 15 Degrees being triftcted by trials, Arches of 
5 Degrees were obtained ; and the fifth Part of thefe was found by trials •, and the Sub- 
divifions of the Degrees into 12 Parts, or every 5 Minutes were made by Bifections and 
Trifections : the outward Quadrantal Arch was divided into 96 equal Parts by no other me- 
thod than that of Bifcction, 'till 60 Degrees of the Quadrant, or two thirds of it, became 
divided into 64, and the remaining third into 32 equal Parts, which make 96 in the whole ; 
and every one of thefe were alfo divided into 16 equal Parts by continual Bifections. There 
is no occafion to direct fkilful Workmen how they fhall make thefe Divifions with the 
greater!: accuracy •, they know more ways than one how to do it of themfelves. Thefe 
two Sorts of Divifions are a check upon each other, being in effect two different Quadrants; 
and the Divifions in one being reduced into the Divifions of the other, by a Table made for 
that purpofe, they arc never found to differ above five or fix Seconds in any place of the 
Limb, and when they do the Preference ought to be given to the bifected Divifions, as be- 
ing determined by a fimpler Operation. One of the 96 equal Parts of the Quadrant is 4^. 
of a Degree, or 56 J Minutes, and one of the 16 equal Subdivifions of every one of thofe, 
will be 3 l-l Minutes. 

To avoid the trouble of fubdividing the Quadrantal Arch into fmaller parts, the Tele- 
fcope belonging to it, and moving about it's Centre, carries a final! Brafs Nonius Plate 
which Aides upon the Limb. 

The 10th Figure reprefents a Degree A B of the upper Arch of the Quadrant divided in- 
to 12 equal Parts, contains five Minutes in each. And CD in the fame Figure is -'- Part 
of the Quadrant divided into 16 equal Parts, each being as already laid 3 T \ Minutes ; and 
E F the Nonius, or fubdividing Plate fixed to the Telefcope and Hiding with it in the Space 
between the Arches A B, CD: the Degrees and Minutes, and alfo thofe 96 Parts of the 
Quadrant are numbered from the Left-hand to the Right, beginning from the Interferons 
of the vertical Radius, in order to meafure the Diftances of Objects from the Zenith. But 
the Parts upon the Nonius are numbered the contrary way, beginning from the Line 00, 
called the Index ; which is drawn perpendicular to the Sides of the Nonius at the End next 
the Right-hand, and the Line of Sight through the Telefcope is lb adjufled by the Crois 
Hairs in it's Focus, as to be parallel to the Index 00 produced through the Centre of the 
Quadrant. 

The Length of the upper Arch of the Nonius is equal to 1 1 of the 12 equal Parts that 
every Degree of the upper Quadrantal Arch is fubdivided into ; and this Arch of the No- 
nius is divided into 10 equal Parts, fo that one of thefe Parts is .' 2 -, ; of a Degree of the 
Arch of the Quadrant, or 5 i Minutes. Confequently the Difference between one of thofe 
equal Parts of the Arch of the Quadrant, viz. $\ and one of thefe 10 equal Parts of the 
Nonius will be half a Minute, or 30". 

The Length of the lower Arch of the Nonius is equal to iy of the 16 equal Parts that 
each of the 96 equal Parts of the oppofite Quadrantal Arch is fubdivided into ; and this 
Arch of the Nonius is divided into 16 equal Parts, wherefore the Length of this Arch of 
the Nonius will be about 59 JL Minutes ; and the Arch of one of the Divifions of this No- 
nius will be about 3 44 Minutes. 

This Quadrant is fixed (it's Centre, and one Side of it being even with the Top of the* 
Wall) to the Eaftern Side of a Free-ftone Wall, built oa purpofe in the Plane of the 

Meridian 5 



Some Account of the Mural Quadrant) &amp;c. 27 7 

Meridian -, the whole Weight of the Quadrant is fuppoited by two ftrong Iron Pins fixed 
to the Wall, and projecting through two Holes in fquare Plates of Iron riveted to the Qua- 
drant at a and b ; the Pin at a, which bears the greateft Part of the Weight, is im move- 
ably fixed in the Wall j but the Pin at b is moveable up or down by a ftrong Screw, in or- 
der to bring one fide of the Quadrant into an Horizontal,' and the oth-r to a vertical 
Pofition. 

That the Motion of the Telefcope about the Centre of the Quadrant may be free and 
cafy, and that this may be obtained by counterpoifing the Telefcope, and eafing the Center 
of the Quadrant of as much of it's Weight as poffible, there is the following Contrivance; 
In Fig. 9. a b reprefents an Iron Axis laid acrofs the Top of the Wall, having two Brafs Fig. 9, 
Plates fixed perpendicularly to the Ends of it, with Notches or Holes cut in them for this 
Axis to turn in, which points to the Centre of the Quadrant at fight Angles to it's Plane : 
to that End of this Axis next to the Quadrant, an Iron Arm c d is fixed, having two Brafs 
Plates V e, d /, almoft perpendicular to it •, to them are riveted two (lender Slips of Fir, 
whofe other Ends meet at g, near the Eye-Glafs, being held together in a Brafs Cap of 
Socket. Through a fmall Plate fixed to one fide of a Collar embracing this lower End of the 
Telefcope, there paffes a fcrew Pin at g, parallel to the Telefcope ; which Pin being fcrew- 
ed into the Cap at the End of the Slips, holds' up the Telefcope right againft the centre 
Work •, the Slips are ftrengthened by 5 or 6 crofs Braces of the fame Wood, as is repre- 
fented in the Figure to the other End of the Axis a b another Arm h i is fixed parallel 
to the Telefcope, and in a contrary Direction, carrying a Weight i to counterpoife the 
Weight of the Telefcope, arid make it reft in any Pofition j and for the greater eafe and 
freedom of it's Motion, two fmall Brafs Rollers are fixed to each Side of it, at k and /, 
which are held tight to the Plane of the Limb by a Plate fpringing againft it's back-fide, 
which Plate has alfo a Roller at each End of it. 

When the Telefcope is pretty nearly directed to an Object whofe Altitude is to be taken, 
a Plate mn which is carried by the Telefcope along the Limb, arid lies crofs it, may be 
fixed to it by a Screw, then by twifting the Head of a long Screw /&gt;, which is parallel to 
the Limb, and which works through a female Screw, annexed to the Plate m ft, and whofe 
Neck at p turns round in a Collar annexed to the Telefcope ; a very gradual Motion is given 
to the Telefcope for bringing the crofs Flairs exactly to cover the Object. 

The Quadrant is fet into the Plane of the Meridian by Flold-fafts, fo as that Radius or 
Side of it which terminates 90 Degrees, is exactly placed vertical, with a Plumb-Line of 
fine Silver Wire, fo fufpended as to play exactly over the middle of the central Point 0, and 
alfo over the Stroke at 90 Degrees upon the Limb below •, this Pofition of the Quadrant 
being once found, another Plumb-Line was fufpended by the Side of the Quadrant, quite 
clear of the centre Work, fo as to play exactly over the Middle of a fine Point made in 
the Limb, in order to examine afterwards, with more expedition, whether the Quadrant 
has kept it's Place. 

In order to help to determine the Degrees, Minutes, and Parts of a Minute, of the Me- 
ridian Altitude of an Object by the Index upon the Limb, it may be obferved, that in the 
Scheme of Fig. 10. the Nonius EF is fo fituated that the upper End of the Index 00 is Fl S* XOi . 
not oppofite to any one ftrokc of the adjoining Arch A B, reprefenting a Degree of the 
Limb divided into 12 equal Parts, or 5 Minutes, but to fome unknown Point of a 12th 
Part of a D grec, intercepted between 50 and 55 Minutes •, and to find the Overplufs above 
50, I obferve by looking back from the Index, that a Stroke of the Nonius, which lies be- 
tween the Numbers 3 and 4, is directly oppofite to a Stroke upon the adjoining Arch, 
which fhews that 3 Minutes and a half is to be added to the 50 Minutes aforefaid. 

But when it happens that no one Stroke upon the Limb is directly oppofite to a Stroke 
upon the Nonius, then look for that fingle Part of the Limb which is fo oppofed to a fingle 
Part upon the Nonius, as to be exceeded by it at both Ends, as is reprefented in the Parts 
G and FI. Then, if by Eftimation of the Eye, this part of the Nonius exceeds the Part of 
the Limb equally at each End, allow 15" more, than if they had coincided at their Ends 
next the Index : and according as the Excefs next the Index, is judged to be one third, one 
half, double, or treble of the other Excefs, allow 7 \'\ 10", 20 // , 22 \'\ fefpectively ; for 
fince the Sum of the two Extreams is always the fame, viz. 30", the Number of Seconds 
to be added will always be to ^o'\ as the Excefs next the Index is to the Sum of the two 

ExCtrfftrS. 

Again, fince, as has been faid, the lower Arch of the Nonius is divided into 16 equal 
Parts, and is equal in Length to 1 7 equal Parts upon the oppofite Arch of the Quadrant 
CD; it will by confequence determine 16th Parts of any one of them. In this Scheme, 
the oppofite Strokes of the Nonius and the lower Arch are fuppofed to coincide at the End 
of the 9th Part upon the Nonius, which fhews that the Index Cuts off 9 Sixteenths of the 
oppofite Part of the Arch ; and fo the Length of the Arch from the Beginning C of a 96th 
Part C D of the Quadrant is thus denoted 15,9, the lower Points being paft the ijtfi 
Stroke -, and becaufe the Arch C D is |4, or 44. of a Degree, or 56 \ Minutes ;• and fo ,V 
Part of the Arch C D is 3 Minutes and 30 44 Seconds. Therefore the Length of the faid 

4 C Arch.

Arch will be 15 Times 3 Minutes, and 30 44 Seconds, together with -/V of 3 Minutes 
and 30 44- Seconds. 

It is agreed amongft Aftronomers, that a large Mural Meridian Quadrant, fuch as this i$ 
which we have been defcribing, is by far the moft accurate, expeditious, and convenient In- 
ftrument of all others for the chief Purpofes of Aftronomy. Tor fince the Meafure of Time 
by Pendulum-Clocks, and confequently the apparent Motion of the Heavens, is now brought 
to the utmoft Perfection ; if by obferving the Time by one of thefe Clocks when any Ob- 
ject in the Heavens comes to the Plane of the Meridian, we fhall have their right Afcen- 
fions ; and by having given the Latitude of the Place, we have alfo their Declinations.; and 
thence their Places in the Heavens. And fo a Catalogue of the Places of the fixed' Stars 
may be made in lefs than a tenth Part of the Time than by the beft moveable Quadrant, 
or Sextant-, not to mention the faving great Labour in Trigonometrical Calculations. 

Note, This fhort Defcription of this Quadrant, may be enough for Gentlemen. As to 
Workmen, they may have a full Defcription of it in the 7th Chapter of the 3d £ook of 
the Second Volume of Dr Smith's Opticks. 

This Quadrant is certainly a moft curious, elaborate, and fkilful Piece of Workmanfhip, 
not, perhaps, equalled by any ot the Kind that has ever yet been made : the Contrivance 
and Direction of the whole being that of the late Mr George Graham, Watch- Maker in 
Fleet-Street, one of the greateft Mafters of Mechanicks in the World ; who did himfelf 
actually perform the Divilions of the Arch, and all the nicer Parts of the Work. But, for 
all this, I think the Instrument is too complex, and redundant in Contrivance, both as to 
Strength and Exactnefs. I mean, a Quadrant of that Kind might have been made as Lift- 
ing, perfect, and fit for the Purpofes defigned by it, and having as much real Exactnefs 
(not apparent, which is often times the Cafe), with much lefs Art, Trouble, and Expence. 
Nor with all it's Exactnefs, do I think an Angle of Altitude can really be taken by it (or 
any other the moft perfect Inftrument of the fame, or a lefs Radius), to -Jth of a Minute, 
or io". However, fome People may deceive themfelves, and imagine the contrary : for 
fince this Radius is not quit 8 Feet, one Minute of the Arch of the Quadrant will be but 
about 28 equal Parts of 1000 that one Inch is divided into •, and 10 Seconds will be but 
about ^4 T Parts of an Inch, which is fuch a fhort Length, as not to be diftinguifhable by 
the naked Eye. Certainly not by mine, and much lefs can any leffer Number of Parts be 
defined, even by the Affiftance of Diagonals, and Nonius's of what Kind fo ever. 

I have oftentimes thought that Angles of the Sun's Altitude may be taken to greater 
Exactnefs by more natural, fimple, and lefs expenfive Contrivances, than by any of thefe, 
and fuch like, very artificial Quadrants. Chiefly by means of a perpendicular Gnomon, 
many Feet high, or the Top of an high Building or Mountain, and the Shadow of the 
Extremity thereof caft from the Sun upon an horizontal Plane : for by having given the 
Heighth of that Gnomon, and the Length of it's Shadow upon the horizontal Plane at any 
Period of Time, the Angle of the Sun's Altitude at that Time may be found to Seconds, 
by Trigonometrical Calculation •, or a long Line may be horizontally extended from the Foot 
of that Gnomon upon the horizontal Plane, being firft divided into a Line of Tangents by 
means of fome of the Tables of Tangents to be found in Books, denoting every ten Seconds 
(as in Benjamin Urfwus\ Trigonometry), the Length of the Gnomon being the Radius, and 
the Parts of that Line which the Extremity of the Shadow of the Gnomon falls upon, will 
be the Degrees and Minutes, &amp;c. of the Altitude. But when the Altitude is but fmall, 
viz. under 30 Degrees, or lefs, and fo the Length of the horizontal Shadow is too great, 
another perpendicular Gnomon, or fome other high Object that will caft a Shadow of 
equal Altitude with the other, and diftant from it as much, or more, than by it's Height, j 
and from the Top of this laft Gnomon there muft be extended the fame Tangent-Line- 
String which was before Horizontal, as a Plumb-Line ; then that part of the Tangent- 
Line, upon which the Shadow of the Extremity of the other Gnomon falls, will give the 
Degrees, &amp;c. of the Sun's Altitude. 

If the Penumbra be an Objection to the Accuracy of this Method, a Telefcope with 
Crofs-Hairs, Wires, or Silken-threads in the Focus, may be ufed, or fome other Contri- 
vance, like a Camera Obfcura, to caft the Sun's Image upon the Tangent-Line : it is true, 
thefe are but rude and imperfect Hints. But this I am certain, that fomething may be 
done in this way, that will exceed any of the diminutive Quadrants, or other complicated, 
and expenfive Inftruments that have hitherto been made, in meafuring Angles to great Ex- 
actnefs. The Ancients ufed Gnomons, and fo did fome of the Moderns in the laft Century, 
as is related in Ricciolus's Afironomia Reformata, &amp;f Geographia Reformat a. He fays, That 
Ulugh Beigh, a King of Pathia and India, a Kinfman of 'Tamerlane the Great, ufed a Gno- 
mon about 180 Feet in Heighth, about the Year 1437. Ignatius Dante errected one in the 
Church of St Petronius at Bononia, 6y Feet high, in the Year 1576. In the Year 1655, 
the Celebrated Caffwi had another in the fame Place 20 Feet high. Father Heinrich, the je- 
fuit, had one of 35 Feet high erected in the Year 1705, at Utrecht. There have been 
others who have ufed Gnomons for taking Altitudes, of no great Moment to mention 
here.

Note, In the Philofophical TrnnfaBions, Numb. 483, there is a new Method of making 
a Mural Quadrant by one Mr Gerfien ; being a Mural Arch furnifhed with a Micrometer, 
free from fome of the Inconveniences he would have to happen to thofe commonly fixed to 
a Wall ; but this Contrivance appears to me, to be too artificial and over nice : rather tend- 
ln&lt;7 to rectify and avoid imaginary Defects, than really fupply any real and confiderable 
Faultsj if any fuchj in the Mural Quadrants already conftructed. 



CHAP. V. 

Of Perfpective G/aJJes y and Rej rafting Telefcopes. 

I. r~r\ H E lead Kind of perfpective GlafTes, are about 4, 5, or 6 Inches long, having only 
J_ two Lenfes within the Tube ; the Object Lens or Glafs, being a double Convex, 
or Piano-Convex, being a Segment of a greater Sphere : and the Eye-Glafs, a double Con- 
cave, being the Segment of a leffer Sphere, placed before the Focus of the Object Lens, 
by the Diftance of the virtual Focus of the concave one. 

The Objects appear through thefe Perfpective G'afTes diftinct, erect, and magnified in 
Diameter, in the Ratio of the focal Diftance of the Object-Glafs, to the focal Diftance of the 
Eye-Glafs : and for purblind Perfons to fee the Object diftinctly, the Eye-Glafs muft be 
brought nearer to the Object-Glafs. There are few of thefe Perfpective GlafTes now made 
that exceed i3 Inches long, becaufe you fee through them a part of the Object fo much the 
lefTer, as it's Diameter is the more magnified. Formerly, indeed, there were Telefcopes 
made with only a double convex Object-Glafs, and a concave Eye-Glafs, from 18 Inches 
long, to about 3 Feet -, which was the Length of Galileo's beft Telefcope, fo famous for the 
great Difcoveries he made with it. Hevelius fays, a good Telefcope of this fort may be 
had when the double convex Object-Glafs is 4 Danzick Feet in Diameter, and the double 
concave Eye-Glafs in Diameter is 4 4 Inches. So likewife will it be, when the former is 
about 5, 8, 10, or 12 Feet, and the latter about 5 ~ Inches. But, as I faid before, the 
Field which thefe Telefcopes take in at one View, is too narrow when they exceed 3 or 4 
Feet in Length ; they have long fince been difufed, excepting the Perfpectives of 4 or 5 
Inches in Length ; where Mr Huygens recommends the Ratio of the Semi-diameter of the 
Object-Glafs, to that of the Eye-Glafs, to be quadruple, or not more than double. 

II. There are Perfpectives from 18 Inches, to 4 or 5 Feet in Length, chiefly for viewing pl a te 2* 
Objects at Sea or Land, confifting of four convex Lenfes or GlafTes, viz. an Object-Lens p . 
A, and three equal Eye-Lenfes, C, D, E ; fo placed in the common Axis A F, that B is 
the common Focus of the Object-Glafs A, and the Eye-Glafs C •, the Eye-Glafs D is fo far 
from C, as that the Diftance C D is equal to twice the focal Diftance C B of the Eye-Glafs 
C ; and the Eye-Glafs E is as much diftant from D as C is from D j and the Eye muft 
be placed beyond this laft Eye-Glafs E, by the Diftance B C. 

By thefe four Lenfes, and fucli a Difpofition of them, very remote Objects will be di- 
ftinctly perceived, erect, and magnified in the Proportion of A B, the focal Diftance of the 
Object- Lens, to B C the focal Diftance of either of" the equal Eye-Lenfes ; there is a fmall 
Annulus, or Ring, placed within the Tube of this Perfpective, either at the common 
Focus of the two Lenfes D and E, or at B, the common Focus of the Object-Lens A, and 
the Eye- Lens C next to it ; by which contrivance is cut off" thofe irregular Rays which are 
not collected near enough to the two common Foci of the Lenfes, and fo are not by means 
of the fucceeding Lenfes fent parallel to the Eye : alfo the Colours near the Margins of the 
Lenfes are taken away, which otherwife cannot well be avoided. 

This is reckoned one of the beft Compofitions of the four Lenfes of a Perfpective, and 
is thought to have been invented by Campani, a famous practical Optician, who lived at 
Rome many Years ago. There are alfo Telefcopes to view the Celeftial Bodies through of 
this fort, having four GlafTes, and of greater Lengths. But a Telefcope of two GlafTes on- 
ly, is fufficient for this purpofe. 

There may be other Compofitions of other Species of Lenfes than all four double con- 
vex ones of equal Convexities, and three of them equal, that may do as well as thefe -, and 
the beft way to find them out is, by Trial : for Example, Suppofe the Object-Glafs a 
Piano-Convex, and the three Eye-Lenfes equal Piano-Convex. 

There have been alfo Perfpectives with three Lenfes, which invert the Object, and make 
it appear coloured. But thefe are not much efteemed. 

There are alfo Perfpectives and Telefcopes, made with fix GlafTes, fhewing Objects 
very diftinct, enlightened and magnified. Such a Telefcope may confift of five 

equal 



2 So Of PerfpeStive Glajfes, and RefraSiing^Telef copes, 

equal Eyc-Lenfes of equal Convexities, placed in rbe Axis of the Tube equally dittany 
from each other, by twice the focal Diftance of either of them -, and the outermofi: 
Eye-Lens next to the double convex Object-Lens is diftant from the Object-Lens by the 
Sum of the focal Diftances of the Object-Lens, and one of the Eye-Lenles ; for by this 
Dvfpofition of the Lenfes, the Rays that come from a very remote Object that fall upon the 
Object-Lens, being as it were parallel, will become again parallel after their Refraction by the" 
fifth Eye-Glafs ; fo they will again, after their Refraction by the third Eye-Lens, and: 
fo will they once more after their Refraction by the firft Eye-Lens : therefore fince the 
Rays coming from the Obje&lt;5bfall parallel upon the Eye, the Object will be distinctly feerh 
J am not certain whether thefe fix Glafs Telefcopes are actually made with fuch Lenfes, io 
difpofed, as I have faid •, for I have not feen their Structure ; but I know that according to 
the Theory, at leaft, fuch a Telefcope may be fo made, although, perhaps, there may be 
Inconveniences in this Method not to be discovered, unlefs by actual Practice : for in the 
Conftruction of Telefcopes, though the Theory and Practice fhould always attend, and fup- 
port each other ; yet the Practice raoft conveniently takes the Lead, is the bnlt Guide, and' 
molt to be depended upon. 

I'raber, in his Opticks fays, That Anthony Maria de Reita, a Roman Optician, made a 
Tube with five Convex-Lenfes, which was reported to be an exceeding good one :. he like- 
wife mentions one Fontana, another Roman Artift of this Kind, who made a Tube with # 
Convex-GlafTes, clearly exhibiting the molt minute Object, at the Diftance of a German 
Mile, which was bought by Cardinal Nepos, for 800 Crowns, and prefented by him to the 
Great Duke of Florence ; but, fays he, by reafon of the Itrong and too violent Refraction, 
the Objects viewed through it appeared coloured, fo that the Tube could not be much 
ufed without hurting the Eyes. He, moreover, fays, that he was told one Euftachio, a 
Neapolitan, made a Telefcope having 19 Convex-Lenfes, in Tubes altogether of 19 Cubits 
long, that would fliew the Pictures of Objects lefs coloured, by reafon of the Interpofition 
of lome of the nicer Glances (neither magnifying, nor diminifning the Objects), which took 
away the Colourings of the Objects. Hence (lays he) we may fee what a great Myftery 
there is in the apt Compofition of Lenfes. 

But how true this is, what are their particular Conftructions and Effects, I know not: 
for unlefs the Compofition of the Glafs, wherewith the Lenfes are made, be exceeding fine 
and pure, free from Veins and Spots, and the Lenfes be molt exquifitely figured, and po- 
lifhed, and befides, very thin, fuch a multiplicity of them muft hinder the PafTage of fa 
many of the Rays that come from the Object to the Eye, as will caufe a very obfeure View 
of the Object. 

It is as eafy in Theory to contrive a Difpofition of the Lenfes for an 8, 10, or 12, &amp;c. 
Glafs-Telefcope ; as for one of four Lenfes. It is but taking as many Equal Eye-Lenfes, 
except 1, as the Telefcope is to have GlafTes, and placing them in the Axis of the Object- 
Lens (being a double Segment of a greater Sphere, which is in all Cafes fuppofed), at equal 
Diftances from one another, each equal to twice the focal Diftance of either : the laft Eye- 
Lens next to the Object- Lens, being fo far from the Object-Lens as is the Sum of the focal 
Diftances of the Object and Eye-Lens. 

III. The Aftronomical Telefcope, viz. one through which the Heavenly Bodies are view- 
ed, confifts of but two double Convex-Lenfes, the Object- Lens and the Eye-Lens ; thefe 
fhew the Object inverted, and magnified rn the Ratio of the focal Diftance of the Object- 
Lens to that of the Eye-Lens ; the focal Diftance of the Object-Lens being always much 
greater than that of the Eye-Lens ; thefe two Lenfes being fo placed in the common Axis 
as that their Diftance is equal to the Sum of their focal Diftances, or, which is the fame 
thing, that their Foci unite in one Point. 

Telefcopes have been made with other Species of Lenfes, befides double convex ones, 
and Honoratus Fabri in his Synopfts Optica, fays, That Eujlachius Divini, a famous Roman 
Optick-Glafs maker, made the Eye-Lens of his Telefcopes to confift of two equal, narrow 
Plano-Convex-Lenfes, touching one another's Convexities in the Axis, and fo placed, that 
the Centre of that Piano-Convex-Lens next to the Object- Lens, was in the Focus of the 
Object-Lens-, by which means the Rays that came parallel from the Object, would fall pa- 
rallel upon the Eye : and, fays Fabri, fome of the Advantages of this Telefcope are, that 
the Colours of the Rain-Bow are excluded from it. The Angle of Sight is augmented. A 
greater Field is taken in at one View. The Object appears more lively and bright. Laftly, 
He would have Water included in the Vacuity between the Convexities of the two touching 
Piano-Convex Eye-Lenfes. See a more particular Account of all this in the 46th Propofi- 
tion of Fabri's Opticks. 

If two equal Lenfes be joined together fo as to touch, the Focus will be removed to a 
Diftance double to that of one of them. Detbales takes Notice, that an Object Glafs of 
2 \ Feet focal Diftance, fits an Eye-Glafs of 1 i Inch. Eujlachius Divini joins an Object- 
Glafs of 8 Feet, to an Eye-Glafs of 4 Inches. Mr Huygens's Telefcope, by which he firft 
obferved the true Phafes of Saturn, and one of his Satellites, confifted of an Object-Glafs 
of 12 Feet focal Diftance, and an Eye-Glafs a little letter than 3 Inches. Afterwards he ob- 
ferved the fame Phenomena by a Telefcope of 23 Feet,, with two Eye- GlafTes of 1 ; Inch

Object-Glafs of 30 Feet joined to an Eye-Glafs of 3 A Inches •, and in his Dioptricks gives

Which Table he thus conftructs ; he multiplies the Number of Feet in the focal Diftance 
of the Object-Lens by 3000, and the fquare Root of the Product will give the Diameter of 
the Aperture in Inches and Decimal Parts : and the fame augmented by a tenth Part of it- 
felf, will be the focal Diftance of the Eye-Lens ; and the apparent Breadths of the Objects 
are as the Diameters of the Apertures. 

Eecaufe two Telefcopes where the Ratio of the focal Diftance of the Object-Lens of the 
one to that of it's Eye-Lens, is equal to the Ratio of the focal Diftance of the Object-Lens 
of the other to that of it's Eye-Lens, do equally magnify the fame Object -, fome may be 
apt to think, that the Trouble of figuring and polifhing the Object-GIafs of a long Te- 
lefcope may be fpared ; and that two fuch Telefcopes are equally good : but in this they 
are miftaken, for the Object in the fhort Telefcope will appear more confufed, dark, and 
indiftinct than in the long one, all things elfe alike. What doth it avail to magnify an 
Object very much, if it cannot be feen dilVinctly j this is all we want, and long Telefcopes 
will always do it belt. 

Sir Ifaac Newton has proved in his Opticks, that the Perfection of Telefcopes is impeded 
by the different Refrangibility of the Rays of Light, and not by the fpherical Figure of the 

4 D Glafs f 



;$z Of PerfpecJive Glajfes, and Refracting TelefcopeL 

Glafs, the Diameter of the little Circle or Focus, through which the Rays are fcattered by 
the unequal Refrangibility, being about the 55th Part of the Aperture of an Objtct-Glals, 
vvhofe Length was 12 Feet, and Aperture 4 Inches: fo that the Error arifing from the 
fpherical Figure of the Glafs, will be to the Error arifing from the different Refrangibility 
of the Rays, as 1 to 5449, which being fo little in comparifon to the other, deferves noc 
to be confidered. He fays alfo, If the Theory of making Telefcopes could at length be 
fully brought into Practice, yet there would be certain Bounds, beyond which Telefcopes 
could not perform, by reafon of the perpetual Tremor of the Air, through which we look, 
at the Sun or Stars ; even though long Telefcopes may caufe Objects to appear larger and 
brighter than fhort ones can do, yet they cannot be fo formed, as to take away that con- 
fulion of the Rays which arifes from the Tremors of the At,mofphere ; the only Remedy 
is, a mod ferene and quiet Air, fuch as may, perhaps, be found on the Tops of the high- 
eft Mountains, above the grolTer Clouds. 

Since the firft Invention of Telefcopes, which is now almofl 150 Years ago, there have 
been many made of all Lengths and Goodneffes, in Italy, England, France, and Germany. 
Several ingenious Perfons having imployed their utmoft Care and Pains to procure the he'll 
and cleareft Glafs pofiible, and ufed their greater! Skill and Dexterity in figuring and polifh- 
ing the fpherical Lenfcs. Sir Ifaac Newton and Mr Huygens took to this Bufinefs, but the 
former made no great Progrefs in it, rather for want of Inclination to continue the Purfuit, 
than Abilities to excel in it, if he had. But Mr Huygens went further, and made very good 
and long Telefcopes of 23, 25, 30, and 123 Feet, which lafl has been in England many 
Years •, the late Doctors Derbam and Pound, made Obfervations with it at Wanjted in EJfex. 
Hevelius of Dantzick, had a Telefcope of 140 Feet ; and Euftachius Divini, and Jofepb Cam- 
pani at Rome (long fince deceafed), made Telefcopes of various Lengths, viz. of 23, 24, 
30, 33, 45, 50, 60, 70, Roman Palms ; the longeft of Campani's was 150 Roman Palms, 
and Francis biancbini, the Pope's domeftick Prelate, made Obfervations with it, in the 
Year 1725. The Telefcopes made by thefe two Italians have been generally efteemed the 
beft in the World. CaJJini too had very good Telefcopes, the longed being 136 Feet ; and 
the longeft that ever I heard off, is one of Artouquellius's (fee the Pbilofophical Tranfaftions, 
Numb. ()2&gt; 181.), of 220 Feet. There are very good Telefcopes of Mr Petroni's made 
in Italy. 

Mr Huygens wrote a Treatife about grinding GlafTes for Telefcopes, wherein he fuppofes 
the GlafTes to be double Convex ones of equal Convexities, and the focal Diftance to be 
given ; then the Radius of the fpherical Surface will be found, by taking it in proportion to 
that focal Diftance, as 12 is to 11 ; the focal Diftance being given, the Aperture of the 
Glafs is alfo given by the Table above. When the Radius of the Convexity of the. Glafs is 
very great, and fo the faid Convexity cannot be defcribed from a Centre, he finds Points 
through which that fpherical Convex is to pafs, by laying off in Effect, upon a Tangent 
to the Pole of the Convex, fome of the fir ft Figures of the feveral Sines of very fmall Arches 
(near one another), taken from the Tables of Sines, &amp;c. and that by means of a Pair of 
Compaffes, and an accurate Diagonal Scale of Inches, fubdivided into centefimal Parts ; and 
afterwards taking the fame Number of the firft Sines of the feveral CGrrefpondent verfed 
Sines of thofe Arches, and laying them off refpectively upon Perpendiculars drawn from the 
Extremities of thofe Sines that are upon the Tangent-Line ; the Radius of the Tables being 
reduced by cutting off the Figures to the Inches expreffed in the given Radius of the Con- 
vexity. Mr Huygens's Concave-Tool, or Plate, or Difh, in which an Object-Glafs is 
ground, was Copper, or caft Brafs fattened upon a cylindrical Stone, with a. Compofition of 
Pitch and Afhes -, and thefe Tools were applied to a turning Lathe, in order to turn the 
concave Surface exactly fpherical ; then he polifhes the Tool by an Incruftation of Pitch and 
Emery, and afterwards with blue Hones. In the Choice of Glafs, he fays that is beft which 
looks fome what yellow, red, or green when looked through againft the Sky-Light, or 
laid upon a Sheet of white Paper : that which is perfectly white, though it tranfmits more 
Light, is generally fuller of Veins, and is often fubject to grow moift in the Air, which in 
Time deftroys it's polifh •, that fuch Glafs was pretty good wherewith Drinking-Glaffes was 
made. That he ordered Pieces of Glafs to be made for his Ufe, of half an Inch, or three 
Quarters thick, in the fame Manner as they make Looking-Glaffes, viz. by cutting off the 
Top and Bottom of the round Globe they blow up, and by flitting the Side of it, and then 
by flattening it upon the Hearth of the Furnace, and afterwards it was ground to an equal 
Thicknefs by a Stone-Cutter, by the Contrivance wherewith he polifhes Marble, or ground 
to an equal Thicknefs, and polifhed a little by a common Glafs-Grinder. Then having found 
how free from Veins this Glafs was, by looking very obliquely againft a fmall Light in a 
Room otherwife dark, or by Reflexion with a Candle in that Room, and made choice of 
the beft for his Purpofe ; he rounds his Glafs-Plate, by firft defcribing upon the two Sur- 
faces two Circles directly over each other, with a Diamond pointed Compafs, reprefenting 
the Circumference of the Object-Glafs ■&gt; and alfo two more concentrick Arches with a Ra- 
dius about a tenth or twelfth Part of an Inch bigger. This done, he feperates the longer 
Part of the Glafs from the outward Circle by a red-hot Iron, or by a ftrong broad Vice, 
opened exactly to the Thicknefs of the Glafs. The remaining Inequalities may be taken off

kv * Grind-Scone ; then having warmed the Glafs and -cemented a wooden Handle to iti 
and in a common deep Tool for Eye-Glaffes, with white clear Sand and Water, he ground 
the Circumference of the Glafs exactly true to the innermoft Circle on each fide of it. The 
Glafs being made in figure of a Cylinder, it is ground upon the Tool with Emery (fome 
ufe common, clean, fine, white Sand), and made fit for polifhing -, then it is polifhed (with 
a Mixture of fine Tripoly and blue Vitriol wetted with Vinegar), by means of a polifhing 
Machine, which he defcribes. This is but an imperfect, fcanty Account of what Mr Huy- 
?ens fays about the figuring and polifhing Glaffes, yet it may be fufficient for a Hint to fatif- 
fy thofe who are defirous only to be acquainted how the thing is done in' general. See the 
Account at laro-e at the beginning of the Second Volume of Dr Smith's Opticks. 

As fpherical Figures for Optick-Glaffes will not collect all the Rays coming from one 
Point of an Object into another Point or Focus, Des Cartes, and fome other of his Geome- 
trical-- Followers, about the middle of the laft Century, recommended hyperbolick and 
lliptick Glaffes, inftead of fpherical ones ; according to which, if the Giaffes were figured, 
thcfe would collect parallel Rays into one Point or Focus, and by that means Telefcopes 
with fuch Glaffes would be better than thofe with fpherical Glaffes ; this is all fully explain- 
ed by Des Cartes in his Dioptricks, where he gives an Inftrument for defcribing hyperbo- 
lick Glaffes ; but the Difficulty of the figuring luch Glaffes deterred fome, and the Objection 
of Sir Ifaac Newton (who has given a long Propofition in his Opticks, proving to them that 
fully underftand it, who I believe are but few, that it is not the fpherical Figure of the 
Giaffes, but the different Refrangibility of the Rays that hinders the Perfection of Tele- 
fcopes), difcouraged others from trying to make Optick-GIaffes of hyperbolick and elliptick 
Figures. There is certainly great Refpect to be paid to Sir Ifaac Ne-wt on in this Matter, who 
was, doubtlefs, the greater! Optician in the World •, but yet I do not take his Proof to be 
abfoluce Conviction, and that fuch hyperbolick Glaffes would not be better than fpherical 
ones : nay, he himfelf in his Optical Lectures, Section I. fays, that Glaffes cannot perform 
more than twice as well as Spherical ones, though they were formed into Figures, the belt 
that could be devifed for that end, and both figured and polifhed exactly alike. From 
whence one may certainly infer, Sir Ifaac thought that it was poffible for fome Glaffes not 
fpherical, to be as good again as fpherical ones •, therefore, if hyperbolick Glaffes will 
double the prefent Perfection of Telefcopes, it will be worth while to try to make them. I 
am fure it may be done by thofe who have a fufficient Skill in Geometry and Mechanicks. 

The Tubes of perfpective Glaffes are of feveral Sorts, and made of various Matter. 
Some are made of ftiff Paper glued together, covered with Parchment or Shagreen ; fome 
confift of fingle Tubes, made of light dry Wood ; others of feveral leffer Tubes, Aiding one 
within another. The Glaffes are fattened in the Tubes to wooden Rings, yet fo as to be ea- 
fily taken out and put in again, by means of Screws various ways, in order to wipe the 
Dull: or Moifture oil" from them, with which they are more or lefs continually covered ; and 
this fliould always be done before the Perfpective is ufed. At the End of everyone of the 
inward Tubes is fitted a wooden Ring, to hinder the lateral fpurious Rays from coming to 
the Eye, which is found by Experience to be of more Ufe than could be thought ; thefe 
Rings are generally furnifhed with female Screws in thofe Places whereat the Glaffes are fit- 
ed. The Perfpectives of three or four Feet, which have but one wooden Tube, are molt 
handy, efpecially, if at each End, inftead of Covers that fcrew and unferew, they have 
thin Hiding Pieces of Brafs for fuch. 

Short Telefcopes may have one fingle Tube, or feveral Sliding-Tubes •, but if the Tele- 
fcope is more than 20 Feet in Length, thefe will be too heavy, and apt to bend when the 
Telefcope is ufing. When the Telefcopes are long, there have been many Contrivances to 
manage and ufe them, as may be feen in Hevelius's Machina Cceleflis ; Father Cherubin's 
Works •, de la Hire's, and others ; all very expenfive, complicated, and trouble- 
fome •, but Mr Huygcns happily freed Aftronomy from this expenfive Lumber, in his 
Aftrofcopia Compendiaria Tubi Optici Molimine Liberata, printed at the Hague, in 1684$ 
who placing the Object-Glafs upon a long upright Pole, contrived to direct it's Axis to- 
wards any Object, by a fine Silk-Line coming down from the Glafs above to the Eye-Glafs 
below -, which Invention was fuccefsfully practifed both by himfelf and others ; particularly 
the late Dr Pound, and Mr Bradley, with Mr Huygens's own Object-Glafs of 123 Feet focal 
Dittance, prefented with it's Aparatus by Mr Huygens to our Royal Society. His contri- 
vance is this : 

ab (Fig. 12. Plate 2. of the Appendix) is the Mart or Pole fet upright in an open Fig. 12. 
Place, nearly as long as the Telefcope itfelf, having one fide of it made flat almoft all pfafg it 
it's whole Length, upon which is nailed two Slips of Wood forming a long Dove-tail 
Channel •, in which is fitted a moveable Board c d. On the Top of the Pole there is placed 
a Pully a, over which goes an endlefs Rope, near half an Inch thick, and as long again as 
the Pole. All way up the Pole, are fixed triangular wooden Steps to go up to the Top 
upon Occafion, not marked in the Scheme. This Rope ferves to draw up or down the 
moveable Board c d, with a fteady eafy Motion, and to the Middle of this Board c d, there 
is fixed a wooden Arm e, extended a Foot from the Pole •, and the Middle of another 
Board// a Foot and a half long, is laid horizontal, and at right Angles, over the End 

of 



,84 Of Per/peSlive Gfqffes, and Refraffhig Tele/copes. 

of that Army and fixed to it •, the Object-Glafs mud be placed upon one End of this crofs 
Board, and the whole mult be lifted up and down by the Rope above-mentioned, the Ends 
of it being tied to the Top and Bottom of the Aiding Board c d, and the whole muft be 
counterpoiled by a leaden Weight b, of a conical Form, fixed to the Rope on the other 
Side of the Pully in fuch a Place, that the Weight may be at the Top when the Objed- 
Glafs is at the Bottom, and contrariwife. 

The Object- Glafs is fixed within a Tin or Brafs Tube /, four Inches long, and to the 
Outfide ot this Tube is fixed a ftrait Stick k /, about an Inch thick, at the Diftance of 8 
or 12 Inches from the End of the Tube ; the whole is fupported by a Brafs Ball m, as big 
as a Marble, fixed to the fai-d Stick by a fhort Neck, lodged in a hollow Socket, in which 
it may play very freely without dropping out ; let the Socket and it's cylindrical Pedeftal. be 
flit into two Leaves, and held together by a Screw paffing through both, but not fo clofe 
as to pinch the Ball. By this means the Object-Glafs and the Stick annexed are moveable 
every way, and to keep them in Equilibrio, an equal Counterpoife of Lead n is fixed to 
the under Part of the Stick k /, by a ft iff" Brafs Wire / •, lb that by bending this Wire to 
and fro, the common Centre of Gravity of the Weight, the Lens and Parts annexed may 
be eafily placed in the Centre of the Brafs Ball, and then the Compound will be moveable 
with the lcaft Touch, and will reft; in any given Pofition; and in this confifts the Judgment 
of the whole Invention. Having ftuck the Pedeftal of the Ball and Socket m into a Hole 
in the End of the crofs Board//, a Silk Line is tied to the Bottom of the Stick k /, an- 
nexed to the Object- Glafs, whofe Length is longer than that of the Telefcope, as that the 
other End of it may be brought to the Eye-Glafs •, fo that when the Object-Glafs is raifed 
up to the Top of the Pole by gently drawing this Thread, while you are moving round the 
Pole, the Object- Glafs will readily obey it's Motion, and be directly oppofed to what Star 
you pleafe. Which could never be performed without placing it in the State of Liberation 
abovementioned : now fince it is abiblutely neceflary that the Stick k I fliould be parallel 
to the Silk Line In, a fhort Brafs Wire is placed at the Tail of the Stick, and is bene 
downwards To far 'till the End of it, where the Silk is tied, be as much below die Stick as 
the Centre of the Ball and Socket is. 

The Eye-Glals is included in a fliort Tube 0, joined to a Stick p, which may alfo have a 
Ball to reft upon, or rather a little tranfverfe Axis q, and a Weight below the Stick to ba- 
lance the Tube and Eye-Glafs. The Obferver takes hold of a Handle r, fixed to the tranf- 
verfe Axis, and holds the lower Stick p, directed towards the upper one k /, by means of 
the Line that connects them, and winds about a Peg or Spool /, fixed in the lower Stick p - y 
io that by pulling gently to extend the Line, the two Glaffes will become parallel to each 
other ; the lower Part of the String comes through a fmall Hole made with a Wire, at the 
farther End of the lower Stick p, like the Pin of a Fiddle, fhortening or lengthening the 
String at pleafure, 'till the Diftance between the Glaffes be brought to a juft Length requi- 
site for diftinct Vifion. 

Note, At u are the Pins ftuck crofs each other to make a Hole for the Line to pafs 
through. 

In order to keep the Eye-Glafs fteady, the Obferver, whether ftanding or fetting, fhould 
Support his Arms upon a wooden Reft x, with only two Feet, holding the Eye-Glafs in one 
of his Hands, which is a readier and more commodious Way than to fix the Eye-Glafs 
upon a three- footed Reft. 

When the Nights are dark, and a Star is to be found in the Telefcope, a Lanthorn y is 
ufed, which collects the Light into a Stream, either by Tranfmition through a convex 
Lens, or by Reflection by a concave Speculum ; for by directing this Stream of Light 'till 
it falls upon the Object-Glafs, and makes it vifible, it is eafy for the Obferver to change 
his place, 'till he finds the Star is covered by the Middle of the Object-Glafs, and then to 
apply his Eye-Glafs, which is fooner done than by a Telefcope with a long Tube. By 
Moon-Light the Object-Glafs is vifible without a Lanthorn. But in viewing the Moon 
through the Telefcope, a Pafte-board Umbrella fhould be put about the Object-Glafs, of 
fuch a Diameter as to cover a Space in the Sky above twice as broad as the Moon, to in- 
tercept that Light from coming to the Eye, which would pafs by the Sides of the Object- 
Glafs, and by mixing with the Light that comes through the Telefcope, and would dilate 
the Appearance of the Lights and Shades in the Face of the Moon. 

This is the Subftance of that excellent Contrivance of Mr Huygeni for viewing Objects 
without long Tubes ; thofe who want the full Account, may confult Mr Huygens\ little 
Treatife abovementioned, or Dr Smith's Englifh Transition of it, in the Second Volume of 
his Opticks. 

Of all the Inftruments invented by Mankind, there are none that ever exceeded Per- 
lpectives and the Telefcope, for the vaft amufive Pleafure, and real Uie afforded by them. 
How is a Perfon delighted with clearly viewing diftant terreftrial Objects through thefe In- 
ftruments, but faintly, or not at all, appearing with the naked Eye, by reafon of their great 
Diftance ? And how great is their real Ufe upon many Occafions for Inftance, in difcover- 
ing the Enemy at Sea or Land, in time of War, to which all the good Coniequences de- 
rived from fuch Dilcovery, are to be attributed ? How poor., lcanty, obfeure, and impertect,

Was the State of Aftronomy, in it's phyfical Part, before the Ufe of the Telefcope, which 
.wiped off from it the Dull of Obfcurity, cleared away the Rubbifh of Error, and opened 
and widened the narrow clogged up Paffage of Sight, leading into the bright, and delightful 
Manfions of the heavenly Bodies, fo vaitly diftant placed, and imperfectly and minutely 
feen by the naked Eye. By this they are diftinctly feen with Wonder, and pleafmg Amaze- 
ment, enlarged in Lignefs and DiM mction ; and many things are difcovered, which now arc 
become familiar to us, that mortal Eyes never before law, or Men could ever have thought 
of. This is the Inftrument which has brought us into a perfect Acquaintance with thofe fur- 
prifing Parts of the Creation, far feparated horn our Globe of Earth, and with which we are 
allowed no other Commerce but looking and obferving, and admiring the delightful Me- 
chanifm of the Works of the Creator, thereby giving us the greateft and moll refpectful 
Notions of his Wifdom and Power ; and the fir ft Inventors of this Inftrument, whoever 
they were, ought always to be highly eftcemed, as well as looked upon to be great Promo- 
ters of Human Happinefs. 

But enough of this. Some of the particular Difcoveries of the Telefcope are thefe. 

I. Spots in the Sun firft difcovered by Galilao and Scheiner, a Jefuit, about the Year 1611, 
of various Shapes,' Bigneffcs, and Durations, they all confift ot a black Part in the Middle, 
of fome irregular Figure, encompafild with a cloudy Border of a colour lefs Dark. Heve- 
lius fays it fometimes happens, that after the gradual Decay and difappearing of the black 
Part, it's place fcems brighter than the reft of the Sun, and continuing fo for two or three 
Days, but Mr Huygens could not obferve this. Scheiner, in his Book called Rofa Urfma, 
tells you he made 2000 Obfervations of folar Spots for 20 Years together, and fometimes 
faw above 50 at once; but bttwixt the Years 1650, and 1670,- he law none; fometimes 
they have been feen with the naked Eye. I myfelf faw one Spot at London in the middle 
of November, fome Years ago. There are many Obfervations of folar Spots to be found 
amongft Authors, fuch as GaliUo, Scheiner, Hevelius, Huygens, Cajfini, and in the 'Tranfac- 
tions of the Royal Societies ok London, Paris, Berlin, in my Opinion not worth particulari- 
zing. By means of thefe Spots it is found the Sun revolves about his Axis in about 25. or 
26 Days. 2. GaliUo, with his little Telefcope, firft difcovered the Phafes of Venus ; he 
firft faw Venus perfectly round, neat, and diftinctly terminated, but very fmall ; after which 
her roundnefs decreafed, 'till fhe appeared femi-circular, and then horned, lefs and lefs, 'till 
they became fo thin as to vanifli at her Occultation in the Beams of the Sun, imitating all 
the Phafes of the Moon. Mr de la Hire fays, that he never failed of feeing the Tranfits of 
Venus through the moveable Telefcope belonging to the Mural Quadrant at the Royal Ob- 
fervatory at Paris, though wit/fin two Degrees of the Sun. He obferved her Tranfit in Au- 
gajl 1700, with a hxteen Foot Tube, which magnified her Diameter of one Minute about 
90 Times, when fhe appeared in the Form of a fine (lender Crefcent, with her Horns in an 
horizontal Line, and her Back upwards; that in the interior Arch of the Crefcent he faw 
fome Inequalities more confiderab!e than thofe of the New Moon, by which he judged fhe 
might have Spots upon her, like thofe of the other Planets. In November 1691, he faw 
her at Noon, very near her fuperior Conjunction with the Sun, appearing round and very 
fmall. Mr CaJJini feveral Times obferved two Spots on Venus, and in the Year 1666, on 
the third of March at Bologna, with a Telefcope of 16 f Feet he faw four Spots, and on 
February 24th he difcovered two others larger, which were feen at Rome with a 35 Foot Te- 
lefcope by Mr Campani. Mr Blanchini, in the Year 1726, at Rome, with Campani's Glaffes 
of 70 and 100 Roman Palms local Diftance, difcovered feveral dark Spots on the Difk of 
Venus, from whence he concludes that a Revolution of Venus, about her Axis, was not 
finifhed in 23 Hours, 20 Minutes, as CaJJini imagined, but in 24 ' Days. 

The Phafes of Mercury are exactly like thofe of Venus, or the Moon ; but the Telefcopes 
muft be pretty good, and properly managed, to obferve them well, by reafon of the ex- 
ceffive Brightnefs, and fhort Digreffion from the Sun of this Planet. Kepler once took a 
large Spot in the Sun for Mercury ; and GaJJendus at Paris took Mercury in the Sun to be a 
Spot: on Oclober 29, 1723, there was a Conjunction of Mercury and the Sun, when the 
Diameter of Mercury was then obferved by a very good Micrometer, applied to the Huy- 
genian Telefcope of 123 Feet, to be \o" \. On the 24th of November 1629, our Horox 
faw Venus in the Sun, by projecting the Sun's Image upon a white Paper in a dark Room, 
whereon fhe appeared to be a fine round dark Spot. The Particulars about the Phafes of 
Mercury and Venus, are to be found in Gajfendus's Mercurius in Sole vifus, ci? Venus invifa ; 
and in Hevelius's Mercurius in Sole vifus. See the Treatife of this laft, entituled, Selenogra- 
phia. Alfo fee the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris for the Year 1700, 
&amp;c. There is nobody that ever could difcover Spots in Mercury. 

Dr Halley tells us, that Mercury in 46 Years, makes 191 Revolutions about the Sun; 
that he appeared the 28th of Oclober, in the Year 163 1, on the Sun's Difk ; ken by Gajfen- 
dus at Paris afterwards, on the 28th of October 1677 ; feen by himfelf at St Helena. He 
fays alfo, that Mercury appeared in the Sun on the 23d of April, 1661. On the 26th ot 
April, 1674. On the 24th of April, 1707. And on the laft Day of Oclober 1726. The 
Doctor alio fays, that on the 26th of May (O. S.), in the Year 1761, near Six o'Clock in 
the Morning at London, Venus will appear in the Sun's Difk, not above four Minutes South

of its Centre; and obferves, if proper Obfervations be made upon the then tranfit of Venus 
with good Clocks and Telefcopes, in different diftant Parts of the World, the Sun's Paral- 
]ax may be determined, and Diftance from the Earth to the Exa&amp;nefs of the 100th Part of 
the whole, (fee the Philosophical ¥ ran factions, Numb. 348.) whereas by the befl Obferva- 
tions hitherto made, fays he, we are not abfolutely certain of thofe Quantities to lefs than 
about the 7th Part of them. 

That we are not certain of thefe Quantities I always thought, and ever fhall -, the Sun's 
Parallax is too fmall a Matter to be obtained by Obfervation to any Exactnefs that can be 
depended upon. The Doctor himfelf owns it to be exceeding fmall, but fays, upon many 
repeated trials Dr Pound and Dr Bradley, by a Micromoter apply'd to the Focus of a Te- 
lefcope, found it to be not more than 12", and lefs than 9" '. Now, fettino- afide the Inac- 
curacy in the Structure, and Smallnefs of the Radius, 65V. of the Inftruments ufed for this 
Purpofe, the Error in defect ariling from the Refraction alone may be fo preat, as even to 
exceed 9". If fo, what becomes of this (lender Parallax, and how immenfely farther off muft 
the Sun be diftant ? 

Indeed Dr Halley, in the Philofophical Tranf actions, at Numb. 368. would have the Air's 
Refraction to be fo little, that none but nice Inftruments can perceive it's Effects ; and that 
Sir Tfaac Newton was the fir ft who afcertained it, and made a true Table thereof, which 13 
fet down in that Tranfaction. But the Air's Refraction is fo unconftant as not to be afcertain- 
ed, and is always greater than many able Aftronomers are willing to allow and fuppofe. Sir 
Ifaac Newton's Table makes the horizontal Refraction to be 11 • 45 // « viz- hVd, when ne- 
verthelefs it is known to be very inconllant at different Times, and in different Places. The 
Dutch formerly wintering at Nova Zembla, I found there the horizontal Refraction to be 4 
Degrees. Sir Ifaac's Table takes the Refraction at Altitudes above 75 Degrees to be fo fmall 
as not to be worth Notice. But De la Hire's Table of Refraclions is extended to 89 Degrees 
of Altitude, making it there to be one fecond. And the famous Mr Caffmi fays, it extends 
quit up to the Zenith. Dr Halley, in the Tranfaction before mentioned, fays, all Diftances of 
Stars are contracted by Refraction, when they are parallel to the Horizon, by the fame con- 
front Quantity, be they nigh or low, viz. one fecond to a Degree •, becaufe (fays he) the 
Chords of the real and vifible Arches, are in the conftant Ratio of the Sine of the Angle of In- 
cidence to that of the refracted Angle. But herein, I think, lies a Fallacy, for he takes the re- 
fractive Power, of the Air at all Times to be conftant at equal Altitudes above the Horizon. 
Whereas this is known to be otherwife. For in Mr Hawkefhy's Phyjico- Mechanical Expcrim. 
pag. 175. it is fhevvn, that the refractive Power of the Air is proportional to the Air's Denfi- 
ty, and fince this Denfity is found to be variable, that refractive Power muft by confequence 
be fo too. Moreover, Sir Ifaac Newton, in the tenth Propofition of his fecond Book of Op- 
tics, fays, that the refractive Power of Air, and all Bodies, feems to be proportional to their 
Denfities, or very nearly, excepting fo far as they partake of fulphureous oily Particles, and 
thereby have their refractive Powers made greater or lefs ; whence, fays he, it feems rational to 
attribute the refractive Power of all Bodies chiefly, if not wholly, to the fulphureous Pares 
with which they abound. Confequently, as I faid above, Dr Halley's taking the Refraction 
of the Air at equal Altitudes to be always the fame cannot be true, becaufe the Air's Denfity 
at thofe Altitudes varies, as is found by the Barometer. Whence the denfer the Air is, the 
greater is the Refraction at a given Altitude ; and it will be ftill the more fo, as it abounds 
with fulphureous oily Particles. Hence it fhould feem, that in dry Weather, when the 
Mercury in the Barometer is higheft, and the Air is the fulleft of fuch Particles, the Refrac- 
tion will be the greater at a given Altitude. But whether the Air in Summer has not more 
fuch Particles in it than in the Winter, in the fame parallel of Latitude •, or whether in very 
cold frofty Weather there are not more than in warmer Weather, are Things that fhould be 
more inquired into than the Aftronomers have hitherto done, in order to determine and afcer- 
tain the true Quantity of the Refraction of the Light coming from an obferved celeftial Ob- 
ject, at a given Time, Place, and Altitude. 

But to obferve a little farther on this Subject. Dr Nettleton, in the Philofophical Tranf ac- 
tions, Numb. 388. fays, in taking the Altitudes of fome Hills, the Obfervations were fo di- 
fturbed by the Refractions that he could come to no Certainty. Having meafured the Height 
of one Hill in a clear Day, he found it, by repeating the Operation on a cloudy Day, when 
the Air was fomewhat grofs and hazy, to be different, and the fmall Angles to be io much 
augmented by the Refraction, as to make the Hill much higher than before, though they 
were carefully taken each Time by good Inftruments. That pointing the Quadrant to the 
-Tops of fome Mountains, they would appear higher in the Morning before Sun-rifing, and 
alfo late in the Evening, than at Noon in a clear Day. That one Morning in December, 
when the Vapours lay condenfed in the Vallies, and the Air. above was pure, the Top of a 
Mountain appeared more elevated by above 30 / than it did in September at Noon en a very 
clear Day. Hence, fays he, Refraction is fometimes greater than at others, but, probably, 
it is always very confiderable, and there being no certain Rule to make allowance for it, all Ob- 
fervations made on very high Hills, view'd at a Diftance under very fmall Angles are uncer- 
tain, and fcarccly to be depended upon, generally erring in making the Heights greater than 

they

they really are. Thus Far Dr. Nettleton. Mr. Huygens long fince, in his Treatife of Light 
obfervcs, that the Refraction of the Air changes every Hour, though indeed his Experi- 
ments were made upon very fmall Altitudes on Objects at Land. And father Laval (as 
appears in the French Hijiory of the Royal Academy * for the Year 1710.) obferved the Sun's 
meridian Altitude on the 22c! of June (N. S.) 1710, to be 70 . 25'. 50'' '. And on the 23d of 
June, at the Pittance of 36 Hours from the Time of the Solftice, he found the meridian Al- 
titude to be 70 . 26'. 00". greater by 10", when it ought to be lefs. And having often- 
times obferved fuch before, he lufpectcd the Refraction varied according to the Difference of 
the Quarters from whence the "Wind blew. Tycho Brache makes the Refractions of the Sun, 
Moon, and fixed Stars, to be different, and would have that of the Sun to end at 46 Degrees 
of Altitude, that of the Moon at 45, and that of the fixed Stars at 20 Degrees •, he makes 
the Sun's horizontal Parallax to be 34/, the Moon's 33', and the fix'd Stars 3c/, which are 
all too little. But de la Hire and CaJJ'mi makes it to be 32' in every Star. He makes that of 
the Sun at 03 to be ^,^\ and at 52 . to be 58". See his Table in his Progymnofm. Lib. I. 
pag. 79, 124, 280. 

Hence amidft io much Difference and Uncertainty about the Refraction of the Air, one 
would be almofl led to be doubtful of the Truth of many aftronomical Conclufions, entirely 
depending upon and deduced from Obfervations, which Doubts mutt laft 'till the Nature and 
Quantity of the Air's Refraction at all Times and Places, are better known and fettled. How 
can one believe the apparent Diameters of the Planets, which are fo very fmall, are fuch as the 
Aftronomers make them, when the true Refraction, at the Time and Place of Obfervation, is 
not well known ; and how can any great Degree of Belief be fixed upon what they fay, as to one 
of thefe very fmall apparent Diameter's being lefs at one Time of the Year than at another. In- 
deed, if the Obfervations were made near or under the Line, where the Refraction is by all 
allowed to be the leaft, efpecially of the meridian Altitudes, thefe would be the mod to be 
depended upon, and accordingly fo would the Confequences deduced from them. The late 
Dr lialley had too flight an Opinion of the Air's Influence upon the Light moving through it, 
juft as he had of it's Influence upon the Motion of Projectiles, which he would have to move 
nearly in a Parabola, though now it is really found by Experience they do not. All this by 
the by. But to return from this feemingly out of the way Digreflion to the Telefcopick Dis- 
coveries in the Moon. 

It is difcovered by the Telefcope, that the Moon's Surface is rough, like our Earth, diftin- 
guifhed into innumerable Mountain?, Caves, and Vallies ; becaufe at the new Moon the Line 
joining her Horn?, and patting between the blight and dark Parts of the vifible Hemifphere 
appears to be compofed of many crooked Turnings and Windings. That many fmall bright 
Spots appear in the dark Portion, ftanding out at feveral fmall Diftances from that common 
Boundary. And at fome Time after they grow fenfibly larger, and apparently nearer to, 
and at laft unite with, the bright Portion of the Hemifphere, juft as the Rays of the rifing Sun 
fhine firft upon the Tops of our high Mountains, then defcend gradually to their Bafes, and 
at laft into the Vallies. There are many fmall Spots obferved interfperfed all over the bright 
Portion of the Difk, fome of which have their dark Sides next to the Sun, and their oppo- 
fite Sides very bright and circular, which fliews them to be round Cavities, whofe Shadows 
fall within them ; and fome of thefe are furrounded with Ridges of Mountains. That thofe 
larger and lefs luminous Tracts, which are vifible to the naked Eye, appear fmoother in the 
Telefcope, and more deprefied than the ambient brighter Regions ; as is evident by a greater 
Regularity and Evennefs of the part of the Boundary of Light and Shade which paffes 
through them at certain Times, and by it's Protuberances at both it's Extremities ; and thefe 
Tracts are not quite free from fmaller Inequalities, efpecially of Light and Shade. 

Now thefe darker Regions may be compared to the Receptacles of our Seas emptied of 
their Water, for that they contain none appears from thofe permanent bright Spots obferved 
in them by fhort Telefcopes; and becaufe larger Telefcopes plainly not only difcover fmall 
Eminencies, but Cavities within them, which feems quite repugnant to the Nature of Seas, 
and the Obfcurity of their Colour may proceed from fome fort of Matter that reflects lefs 
Light than the other Regions do. There may be Soils in the Moon very different from any 
we are acquainted with on the Earth. 

The Magnitude of the Moon's Mountains is found to be much higher than any of the 
Earth's. When only the Tops of them are enlightened by the Sun, they appear as bright Specks 
in the dark Part of the Moon's Difk ; and the apparent Diftance of feveral fuch Specks from the 
Limit between the dark and bright Parts of the new Moon, has been found to be about the 
20th Part of the Moon's apparent Diameter, and from thence it has been concluded, that the 
Height of thofe Mountains is above five Miles. Ricciolus reckons the Height of one of the 
Moon's Mountains called St Catherine, to be nine Miles. 

It could never be difcover'd by the beft Telefcopes, that there were any vifible Changes 
in the Colours, Shapes," and Situation of the Moon's Spots ; their Appearances being always 
the fame, Allowances being made for their different Lights and Shades in different Ages of the 
Moon •, for the different Goodnefles of Telefcopes, and the Clearnefs of our Atmofphere ; 
nor can it be fairly concluded, from any Obfervations hitherto made, that the Moon has an At- 
mofphere, although many Aftronomers would make one believe it has. Cajfini, in the Me- 
moirs 



88 Tekf topical DiJ cover ic$. 



tnoirs ot the French Academy ■, for the Year 1706, fays, he has often obferved the fpnerical 
Figure of Saturn, Jupiter, and the fixed Stars, at their Occultations near the enlightened or 
obfeure Limb of the Moon, to be changed into an oval Figure ; and at other Occultations 
he has difcovertd no fuch Alteration in their Figure, juft as the Sun and Moon in a vapour- 
ous Horizon appear to be ovular at their rifing or fetting. Hevclius, in his Ccmetogro.phia* 
Page 363, fays, that he has obferved feveral Times in the moil ferene Air, whmin he 
could dilcover Stars of the fixth and feventh Magnitude, when the Moon had the fame Al- 
titude and Diftance from the Earth, and with an excellent Tclefcope, that the Moon and 
her Spots did not appear equally bright and diftinct, but at fometimes did fo much more 
than at others. Sometimes in a clear Air, when Stars of the fixth or feventh Magnitude 
were feen, the Moon has quite difappeared, fo as not to be feen by the beft Telefaxes • 
fuch a thing was feen by Kepler in the Years 1580, 1583, and 1620 ; as alfo by Hevelius 
and by Ricciolus, the 14th ot April 1642. See Kepler's Optical Aftronomy, Pag. 227, 297. 
his Epitom. Aftron. Copernican. Lib. v. Pag. 825. Hevelius's Selenogr. Pag. 117, and Ric- 
dolus' 's Almag. Nov. Lib. iv. Cap. 6. Pag. 203. 

It has been difcovered by the Tdefcope, that the Hemifphere of the Moon vifible to us 
is not at all Times quite the fame •, at one full Moon we fee a fmall Gore, or Segment, in 
the Margin of her Dirk that was quite hid at another •, fo that her Body appears to us as if 
it librated to and fro ; fometimes eaftward or weftward, fometimes northward or fouth- 
ward, and fometimes in a Direction between both. See concerning this in Hevelius's Book 
de Motu Lun&lt;e Libratorio. 

Langrenus and Hevelius were the firft who publifhed Maps of the Moon's Spots, as they 
appear through a Telefcope, with Names ot the moft remarkable Spots and Regions, as 
well for the more immediate aftronomical Purpofes, as for Pofterity to obferve what Changes 
may happen in them. 

Now we are upon the Moon, I believe the following fhort Digrefiion, concerning her 
Light, will not be difagreeable. Dr Smith, in the firft Volume of his Opticks, Pag. 29, 
30, fiys Day-Light is about 90000 Times greater than Moon-Light. And in his Remarks, 
Vol. II. pag. 16. tells us, one Mr Bouguer, in a Treatife of his entituled, EJfai dioptrique 
fur la gradation de la Lumiere, finds the Light of the full Moon to be about 300000 Times 
weaker than that of the Sun, at a Medium of feveral Trials : and the Doctor fays, juft after 
that, he himfelf found it by Theory, not much above 90000 Times : the Difference may 
arife chiefly (continues he) from the lofs of Light in the Moon's Body, which could not be 
allowed for in the Theory. Rut, I neither take the Sun's Light to exceed that of the Full- 
Moon near fo much, as either of thefe Gentlemen here make it, nor the Experiments and 
Theory upon which they have proceeded, and deduced thefe their Conclufions, to be de- 
pended upon, and free from Error : for 1. the Doctor's Proof is upon the Suppofition that 
all Day-Light is much the fame, *. e. equal, he fays it, at Pag. 30, Vol. I. which is moll: 
evidently not fo ; for the Day-Light of a cloudy Day in Winter is moft certainly many 
Times lefs than that of a clear Day in the Summer. 2. The Doctor would have Moon- 
Light to be no greater than the Light of a white Cloud, which I take to be another Mi- 
stake. 3dly, Mr Bouguer fuppofes two Lights to be equal, when he thinks he fees them fo, 
by looking at them ; which at beft is but a fort of guefs-work, liable to great Uncertainty : 
the feeing minute Objects equally diftant from two Lights with the fame Diftinction, 
would be better than this, though not certain neither. 4thly, That Light decreafes as the 
Square of the Diftance, I am doubtful of, and have been fo many Years •, there is no Proof 
of it by actual Experiments as I know : indeed, it has been long made out by Theory to 
be fo •, but the practical Proof of thefe things is beft, and moft to be relied upon ; and I 
have often thought, that Light in fome cafes, as well as Pleat, may decreafe, rather as the 
Cubes of the Diftances, than as the Squares ; be this as it will, I am fure neither the Doctor 
nor Mr Bouguer have made out their Affertions to my Satisfaction. I could fay a great deal 
more about this, but at prefent have not Inclination. If any body has a Mind to defend 
thefe Gentlemen in this Point, I fhall then be urged on to proceed to farther Particulars. 
But to return to the 

Telefcopick Difcoveries. 

The Diameter and Parallax of Mars are faid to be above five Times greater in his Op- 
pofition to the Sun than in his Conjunction. In both thefe Pofitions his enlightened He- 
mifphere is fully expofed to the Earth, as well as the Sun : but not fo fully in his Qua- 
dratures with the Sun, where he appears through a Telefcope to be a little gibbous, like the 
Moon about three Days from the Full. Dr Hook and Mr CaJ/ini firft difcovered Spots upon 
Mars of determinate Figures, by which it has been found that he revolves about his Axis in 
twenty -four Hours and forty Minutes. One of thefe Spots appeared like a Joyner's Square, 
or obtufe-angular Bevel -, thefe Spots change their Colours, Shapes, Situations, and vanifh 
at different Times. Mr Miraldi fays, that one of the bright Spots upon Mars appeared 
for near 60 Years, and that it was the only permanent Spot upon his Body. Mr Cojfir.i 
fays, he obferved a fixed Star in the Water of Aquarius, which at the Diftance of fix Mi- 
nutes from the Difk of Mars, became fo faint before it's Occultation, that it could not be 

feen

fcen with the naked Eye, nor with a three Foot Telefcope. The like Diminution of it's 
Light after it's Occupation, was obferved by Mr Reaumeur at Paris, who could not fee that 
Star with a large Telefcope in a very clear Air, 'till it's Diftance from Mars became equal to \ 
of it's Diameter, and yet Stars of that Magnitude are plainly vifible, even in Contact with 
the Moon : by a Comparifon of feveial Obfervations then made upon that Star, it was 
judged that it varied it's Diftance from the neighbouring Stars ; and by fome it has been 
therefore concluded, that Mars has a very extenfive Atmofphere. See more particularly 
about thefe Spots in du Hamel's Hiftory of the French Royal Society, pag. 9 J, 107. 
Edit. 2. 

In the Pbilofopbical Tranfac7ions, at Numb. 128, Dr Halley fhews how to find from three 
given Diftances of Mars trom the Sun, his mean Diftance and Excentricity, which in effect 
amounts to the Construction of a Geometrical Problem, viz. one of the Foci of an EllipfiSj 
palfing through three given Points being given : to defcribe fuch an Ellipfis, thence find the 
other Focus, as alfo the two Axes. Now the Doctor's Conftruction is by the Interferon 
of two Hyperboles, which will be in the other Focus required ; but this is only a plain 
Problem, conftructable by right Lines and Circles, without the actual Defcription of two 
Plyperbolas, although, indeed, the doing it by two Hyperbolas is the molt fhort and na- 
tural way poflible •, the plain Problem in effect is, to find the Centre of a Circle (which 
will be the other Focus), that fhall touch three given Circles : and a more elegant Computa- 
tion of this than what the Doctor has given in that 1'ranfatlion, may be obtained from Lemma 
16. Sect. 4. Lib. i. Princip. Mat hem. Philof. Naturalis of Sir Ifaac Newton. 

By the Telefcope it is difcovered, that on Jupiter there are two Belts lighter than the reft 
of his Difk terminated by parallel Lines, which are fometimes broader, fometimes narrower* 
and not always fituated on the fame Part of the Difk. And Mr Huygens fays {In his Syftem 
of Saturn, pag. 7.), that he faw in March, in the Year 1656, a much broader though ob- 
icurer Belt, in the Middle of the Diik of Mars. 

About the End a\~ November, in the Year 1609, Simon Marias (fee his Preface Ad Mun~ 
dum Jovialem), firft Mathematician to the Elector of Brandenburgb, firft difcovered three 
Stars moving about Jupiter, and attending him ; and in February 1610, he faw a fourth: 
and in Italy, Galileo law the fame Stars the 7th of January, in the Year 1610, and pub- 
lifhed his Obfervations upon them in a Treatife, entitled, Nuncius Sidcreus. Thefe four 
Stars, called Satellites, moving about Jupiter, are at different Diftances from him, and the 
periodical Times of the Motions of the firft, is one Day and about 18 4 Flours-, of the 
fecond, three Days, and about 13 Flours; of the third, feven Days, and almoft 14 Hours j 
and of the fourth, fixteen Days, and about 16 \ Hours. Mr CaJJini, and others, difcover- 
ed Changes in Jupiter's Belts. Spots upon the Satellites. Jupiter's Figure to be fpheroi- 
dical. The Ratio of his Axis to his equatorial Diameter being according to Cajfini as 14 13 
to 15; and according to the late Dr Pound,' as 12 is to 13. Tranfits of the Body and 
Shadows of the Satellites, in Form of black Spots over the Difk of Jupiter. There are a 
great many Particulars about thefe Spots, to be found in aftronomical Writings, efpecially 
in the Tranfaclions of the French Royal Society, fcarcely worth mentioning here, as I 
think. 

Tables of the Motions of Jupiter's Satellites were firft publifhed by Mr Cajfini, then Mr 
Flamftead, and by Dr Halley, and afterwards by Dr Pound. There are ethers too who have 
given Tables of them. But thefe may be looked upon as little more than bare Tranfcribers. 
Dr Pound particularly has endeavoured to rectify the Motion of the firft Satellite nuxt to 
Jupiter, and to make the Calculation eafy of it's Eclipfes in the Shadow of Jupiter, thirteen 
of which happen in a Month, thereby affording very frequent Opportunities of determining 
the Longitude of Places, efpecially at Land, by Time-keepers, and Telefcopes of proper 
Lengths, viz. thofe of 12, 16, or 20 Feet at leaft ; it being found, that with fhorter Tele- 
fcopes the Times of the Emerfions cannot be fo well determined as with longer. 

This Way of finding the Longitude of Places at Land is practicable, and fufficiently exact* 
but at Sea it has been found to be ineffectual, by reafon of the Length of the Telefcope, which 
Cannot be managed with fufficient Steadinefs and Dexterity in a Ship, during it's various Agita- 
tions by the Winds and Waters. The Way of finding the Longitude of Places, by the Ob- 
fervations of the Times of the Eclipfes of the Satellites of Jupiter is certainly ingenious, but 
liable to fome Difadvantages ; for were the Telefcope, by which Jupiter and his Satellites is 
obferved, never fo good, and well managed, there are none but Aftronomers, and thofe who 
have been a good while accuftomed to celeftial Obfervations that could do this Bufinefs with- 
out being liable to miftakes. Though almoft every Body knows Jupiter, and can diftin- 
guifh him from the reft of the Stars near him, a Perfon not ufed to Obfervation may take one 
Satellite for another, or fixed Stars for Satellites, as did Antonius Maria Schyrleus de Rheitd, 
a Capuchin of Cologne, who thought he had difcovered five more Satellites moving about Ju- 
piter on the 29th Day of December, 1642, which for the Honour of Pope Urban the Vlllth 
he call'd by the Name of Sidera Urbana Oclaviana. See Gajfendus's Letter to Gabr. Naudaum 
de novem Stellis circa Jovem vijis, which tum'd out to be only five fix'd Stars. Befides all 
this, the Influence that the Satellites have upon each other are obferved to difturb their Mo- 
tion in fome meafurc; and that of the firft is faid to be liable to Inequalities that will caufe

Effects not eafily reduced to any Rule, but from a long Series of Obfervations. See the 
Philcfpbical Franfaftions, Numb. 394. Alfo in thefe Tranfadions, are to be ken Obferva- 
tions of Eclipfes of the Satellites of Jupiter, in many Parts of the World. 

One Mr Reaumeur, a foreign Aftronomer, many Years ago, from the Difference between the 
calculated Time of one of thefe Eclipfes, and the obferved Time, will have it that Light is 
about ten Minutes in its Paffage from Jupiter to us. Sir Ifaac Newton and his Followers will 
have it to be in but feven or eight Minutes. Others have laid, the whole is doubtful. See 
the Memoirs of the French Royal Society for the Years 1707, and 1729. of which laft Num- 
ber I myfelf am one. For I think no Man ever knew enough of the Nature and Motion of 
Light, to be certain how it really moves and acts. Dr Barrow was a very great Man, as 
well as Sir Ifaac Newton. He fays in his Opticks, that the Arguments for and againft the di- 
rect Propagation of projected Light, and it's Propagation by the fmall Jmpulfes of fome 
elaftick fluid Medium were lo equal, that he durft not venture to affert which was right ; 
they- might be partly both, fays the Doflcr. 

I have lately thought, that the Sun's Light and Heat too is not only greatcft where it is 
molt reflected and refracted, but in the vaft Space between the Sun and the Planets, where 
there is little or no reflective or refractive Matter, the Sun's Light and Heat is leaft, whe- 
ther the Diftances be nearer or farther from the Sun. That his Heat is moil in Vallics, and 
low fandy Situations, is well known by Experience •, and that on the Tops of many Mountains, 
even near the Line there is Snow to be found at all Times of the Year. (See Farenius's Geo- 
graphy.) And I take many of our upper Clouds to be chiefly Snow or Hail, both Summer 
and Winter. Hence, at a fmall Diftance from the Earth's Surface the Sun's Heat muft 
needs be confiderably leffer than at the Surface itfelf, and at greater Diftances upwards towards 
the Sun, it is not unreafonable to fuppofe the Sun's Heat to be fbli lefs, and that it may decreafe 
to certain Limits, either towards the Sun or from it. Confequently, if this be the Cafe of the 
Sun's Heat, I fhould think it muft be fo of his Light too, which is greateft at the Surface 
of the Planets, by reafon of the Refraction of their Atmofpheres (fuppofing them to have 
fuch) and the Reflections at their Surfaces, &amp;c. and therefore from thefe, and many other 
Considerations, I am doubtful whether the Sun's Light at the feveral Planets., be the great- 
eft, the nearer the Planet is to the Sun ; and whether, if a Perfon were a thoufand Miles, 
for Inftance, above the Earth, towards the Sun, the Light that he would perceive there 
would not be very weak and faint. Thefe foreign, fhort, and rude Suppolitions, may per- 
haps ferve as a Bar in the Way to hinder the taking Conjectures for Certainty, and making 
Conclufions founded upon the imaginary Nature of Light, which no Body truly knows (nor 
perhaps never will) be taken as indubitable Truths. Sir Ifaac Newton's Proposition, about 
the Time of the Motion of Light from the Sun to the Earth is very fhort. It is Prob. XI. 
of Part 3. Book 2. of his Opticks. He fays, when the Earth is bet./een the Sun and Jupiter, 
the Eclipfes of the Satellites happen above feven or eight Minutes fooner than they ought to 
do by the Tables ; and when the Earth is beyond the Sun, they happen about feVen or eight 
Minutes later than they ought to do, the Reafon being, that the Light of the Satellites 
has farther to go in the latter Cafe than in the former, by the Diameter of the Earth's Or- 
bit, fcff. 

In the Philofophical Franfaffions, Numb. 406. there is a curious Account of Dr Bradley's 
to prove, that Light is eight Minutes coming from Jupiter to us, chiefly from Obfervations 
of the Declinations of the fixed Stars being different fome Times of the Year, from what they 
are at other Times, by fome Seconds, though never exceeding 4c/ / or 41". The Particulars 
of his Obfervations are there fet down for two Years, viz. 1727, and 1728. Upon the whole 
of which I fhall briefly obferve, 1. The taking Angles to Seconds are very nice Things, of- 
tentimes fubject to Uncertainty, efpecially by reafon of the Difference of the Refraction in 
the Air at the Time of the Obfervations, not yet fettled as it fhould be, by any Rules or 
Tables that ever yet has appeared in publick. 2dly. There is befides another Doubt with 
me, viz. whether upon the increafing or leffening the Magnitude of the Pupil of the Eye, 
the Magnitude of the Optick- Angle will not be accordingly increafed or decreafed. And if 
this be the Cafe, fince the Pupil increafes as the Light falling upon it decreafes, whether 
fmall Diftances and apparent Diameters of Objects in the Heavens, though thefe Objects be 
equally diftant from the Eye, will not at one Time appear more or lefs by fome Seconds, 
than at another Time, viz. generally lefs in the Summer, when the Light is greateft; and 
greater in the Winter, when the Light is leaft. And whether the apparent Diameter of the 
fame diftant Object, at the fame Diftance, will not appear greater, if by any Caufe it be- 
comes lefs bright, or more obfeure, than when it is more fhining or white. 3dly. It feems 
to require feveral Years Obfervations, at feveral Places, by feveral People, to fix the Truth 
of this ingenious Gentleman's great Conclufions beyond Difpute. He is certainly a fine Ob- 
ferver, and great Aftronomer ; but the Love of Truth, and that only, has made me ad- 
vance thefe Doubts, not out of any Ill-nature, or Difrefpect, or with any View ot acquiring 
the leaft Praife thereby. If I am but right, that is all I care for. And no Man can juftly 
be blamed for reafonable Sufpicions in Science efpeciallv, which fhould always be clothed in 
Truth,

Telefcopical Difcoveries. 291 



There is another ingenious Difcourfe of the Doctor's in the Philofophical Tranfaclions^ 
Hunib. 485, for the Year 1747, on the apparent Motion of Tome of the fixed Stars. 

Saturn has the mod extraordinary Appearance through a Telefcope, of any of the reft of 
the Planets. Galileo, with a bad Telefcope, took him for three Globes, a larger between 
two fmaller, almoft contiguous to one another. Sometimes the middle Globe was left quite 
alone. Then they feemed to ftick to the middle Globe •, to put on various Shapes, appear- 
ing fometimes round, fometimes oblong, like Acorns, fometimes femicircular, then lunar, 
with Horns pointing towards the Globe in the middle, and growing by degree fo long, and 
fo wide, as to encompafs it with an oval Ring. Thefe monftrous Appearances puzzled the 
Aftronomers at fir ft to account for them. Hevelius, in his little Trad, Be nativa facie Sa- 
turni, reckons Saturn, 1. To be Mono-fphcrical. 2. Tri-fpherical. 3. Two-handled- fpheri- 
cal. 4. Elliptical-handled. 5. Spherical-horned. And thefe Phafes he has again fub-di- 
ftinguiihed. But Mr Huygens, in his Syftcm of Saturn, evidently made it appear, that thefe 
wonderful imperfect Appearances were owing to the want of good Telefcopes. For with bet- 
ter ones he difcovered a Ring about Saturn, which was the true Caule of all thofe furprizing 
Phenomena •, and bcfides that, a Satellite revolving round Saturn every fixteen Days, or there- 
abouts, in the Plane of the King produced. This Satellite was firft difcovered by him in 
March, \&amp;S5-&gt; D y Telefcopes of 12 and 23 Feet; and afterwards Cajfini, at different Times, 
found out tour more Satellites, viz. the two neareft to Saturn, with the Telefcopes of Cam- 
■pani of 100 and 136 Feet, in March, 1684. The third in December, 1672. with one of 
Campani's Telefcopes of 35 Feet-, and the fifth (viz. that of Huygens's) in Oclober, i6ji. 
by a Telefcope or 1 7 Feet. Afterwards he faw the two inward ones, with Telefcopes of 
Campari of 47 and 34 Feet •, and by Telefcopes of Borelli of 40 and 70 Feet •, and at length, 
by Telefcopes of Artouquelliitfs of 80, 155, and 220 Feet. See the Philofophical Tranf- 
aclions, Numb. 92, and 181. Mr Huygens, with a 12 Feet Tube, faw Saturn with two 
Arms oppofitely extended from his Globe, and a darkifli Zone or Line pafTing ftraight over 
the Difk, between the upper Sides ol the Arms was vifible. He faw Saturn quite round 
fometimes, and that Zone was parallel to our Equator. He makes the Space between the 
Globe and the Ring ro be equal to, or rather bigger than, the Breadth of the Ring, and the 
greateft Diameter of the Ring is to the Diameter of the Globe, as nine is to four, but Df 
Pound makes it ro be as (even is to three. That there is empty Space between the Ring and 
the Body is evident, from feeing the fixed Stars fometimes through it. The broad fide of 
the Ring has fometimes appeared bifecfed quite round by a dark elliptick Line, divided as it 
were into two Rings, of which the inner one appeared brighter than the outer. The Ring 
continues invifible all the Time that it's Plane produced paffes between the Sun and the 
Earth. Mr Caffmi fays, he could fee all the five Satellites of Saturn with a 34 Feet Tube% 
whereas Mr lladley owns, he never could have the Fortune to fee them all five with his 
Reflecting Telefcope. The periodical Times of the Satellites are of the firft, one Day and 
about 21 Flours ; of the 2d two Days and about 17 Hours ; of the 3d four Days and about 
12 Hours •, of the 4th fifteen Days and about 22 Hours •, and of the 5th feventy-nine Days 
and about 7 Flours. There are many other curious particular Phenomena of Saturn and his 
Satellites, obferved by Huygens, Caffmi, Muraldi, Dr Pound, &amp;c. with the Telefcope. See 
the Second Vol. of Dr Smith's Opticks, from page 438, to 447. and our Philofophical Tranf- 
aclions,, as well as thole of the French. I fhall only add here, that it might fomewhat 
ftrtngthen the Truth of the Affertion already mentioned, viz. that Light is about feven or 
eight Minutes in it's Paffage from Jupiter's Satellites to us. If from the like Obfervations 
of the Eclipfes of Saturn's Satellites, the Difference of the obferved Times, from the Times 
by the Tables, were found to be proportional to that feven or eight Minutes, as Saturn's 
mean Diftance is to Jupiter's. But this I leave to Aftronomers, having neither Inclination 
nor Abilities to attempt it myfelf. It may, perhaps, be impoffible, though indeed, at pre- 
fent, I do not fee that it is. 

The beft Telefcopes do not at all magnify the apparent Diameters of the fixed Stars, nor 
can it be difcovered that the fixed Stars have any fenfible Parallax. Mr Caffini, in the French 
Memoirs for the Year 171 7, fays, that he faw Sirius under an Angle of 5" or 6 // , with a 36 
Foot Telefcope, and then with a 3 Foot Telefcope. But Dr Halley, in the Philofophical 
Tranfaclions, Numb. 369, has fhewn the Fallacy of this his Affertion. The Radius of Caf- 
fini' s Inftrument of 3 Feet being too fmall for fuch a nice Obfervation, and the Difference of 
the Refractions of the Air, which may be f or 8", being greater than this whole Parallax, 
5" or 6" fuppofed to be obferved. 

The beft Telefcopes have difcovered nothing extraordinary in the fixed Stars ; you only 
fee vaft Multitudes of them hid from the naked Eye, excepting indeed, that Mr Huygens, in 
his Syftem of Saturn, tells us, he faw three Stars in the middle of Orion's Sword (marked 
by Bayer) together with four more, fhine out, as it were, through a whitifh Cloud, much 
brighter than the ambient Sky, which being very black and ferene, caufed the lucid Partes to 
appear like an Aperture that gave a Profpect into a bright Region. He found it to conti- 
nue in the fame Place, and not altered in Shape. See another of thefe in our Philofophical 
Tranjaclions, Numb. 347.

0/* Z&gt; James Gregory's Reflecting Te/efcope, as improved by 

Mr Hadley. 

Plate 3, /t T the Bottom of a large brafs Tube, Fig. 13. (exprefTed by a ftrong black Line) is 

Fig. 13. jl\ fix'd a concave meta-line Speculum B B, with a round Hole C C in the middle thereof, 

©ppofite to which Hole is placed a lYnall Speculum of the fame Metal F F, concave towards 
the great Metal, and fo fix'd to a crooked Arm, that it may be brought towards or carried 
from the great Speculum, keeping it's Axis ftill in the fame Line (viz. the common Axis of 
both the Speculums) ; and by that means parallel Rays, or Rays from the Points of a very 
diftant Object, coming to the great Speculum in the Lines O O, P P, &amp;V. and falling upon 
the great Speculum between B and C will be fo united at it's Focus, as to form there the 
Image G G of the Object O P, iuppofed to be at a vail Diftance. The Rays diverging a^ain 
from their refpective Points of the Images, go on diverging, and fall upon the little Concave 
F F, whofe focal Length is D I, and from it's Surface are reflected nearly parallel to their re- 
fpective Axes (not quite fo, becaufe D G is greater than D I) and with all the Axes, or prin- 
cipal Rays, move parallel to the convex Axis through the Hole in the great Speculum, irt 
the Direction D A -, fo entering into the fmall Tube NMMN, which is fixed to the great Tube 
behind the Speculum, fall upon the plano-convex Eye- Lens N N, and pafling through it form 
a fecond Image atgg* whofe Bignefs is limited by the Hole of a perforated opake Circle 
placed at R R. That fecond or erect Image of the firft inverted Image of an erect Object, is 
feen large by the Eye at E, which fees it through the fmall Hole in the Plate M M, and the 
laft Eye-Glafs S S, which is a Menifcus. For the Eye will fee it under the Angle S E S, 
made by the Axes of thofe Pencils of Rays which came from the Extremities of the vifible 
Object •, and the Rays belonging to each Pencil will be parallel to their refpective Axes, and 
the fpurious Rays will be all cut off by the Plate M M, which makes the Vifion diftinet. 
This Telefcope is not only good for common Eyes, but the Rays that enter the Eye will be 
made to converge a little for old Eyes, or to diverge a little for fhort- lighted Eyes, by 
means of a Screw fixed to the Arm of the little Concave to remove, or to bring it forwards 
upon Occafion. 
- l g- 14. The Figure of this Telefcope, upon a Support, is feen at Fig. 14. This Support is 

contrived thus, the Bafe of the Pedeftal a b is a thick Board refting upon four brafs 
Feet underneath it, one of which being a Pin p, that fcrews through the Board, will make 
it fteady upon any uneven Plane, b is a fmall upright Pillar about a Foot long, fixed in the 
Board #, and c d is a brafs Arm that fcrews into it. d e is a fhort brafs Piece, that turns 
round upon the End of the Arm c d y and is tightened and (fayed by the Screw d. c is a hol- 
low Socket, having a round brafs Ball in it, moveable any way, and tightened and ftayed by a 
Screw or two ; the Neck of this Ball is fixed to the middle of a long brafs Piece fg, which 
is fixed along the Side of the Tube h i, by the Screws/^, and may be taken off at pleafure. 
Thus the Tube is fupported, and made capable of being gradually moved, and ftayed in any 
Pofition. The larger concave Metal having a Hole in the middle of it, is lodged in the 
Bottom of the larger Tube h i k&gt; and the fmaller concave Metal is held in the Axis of the 
Tube, near the Mouth of it, by a fmall brafs Arm coming through a Slit in the Tube at h. The 
long iron Wire h i k on the outfide of the Tube fkrews through a Hole in the Arm at b&gt; and 
is confined from moving Length-ways, by two Shoulders on each fide of a fmall Hole in a 
fixed Plate at i ; and being turned round itfelf by the Knob at k, it draws the Arm and little 
Concave backward or forward, in order to procure diftinet Vifion of Objects, at various 
Diftances, and for Eyes of different Sorts ; while the Obferver is looking in at the End / of 
a fhort flender Tube that is fkrewed into the End of the larger, and carries the Eye-Glaffes. 
When this Telefcope is ufed at home, the Pedeftal a b may be placed upon a Table near a 
Window, or upon a Window board ; but when it is ufed abroad, the Pedeftal may be left 
at home. For having tapped a Hole in the Side of a Tree, or any piece of Wood, with the 
Hand-Augre m, the wooden Screw at the End of the Arm c d, may be prefently fcrewed in- 
to it •, the Augre m being put through the Hole c, to give Power to the Hand in turning the 
Screw. 

This reflecting Telefcope made about 16 Inches long, is equivalent to a common dioptrick 
Telefcope of above 15 or 16 Feet long •, that is, magnifies as much, and is faid to fhew Ob- 
jects as diftinctly too ; but of this laft I am not fo certain. And the Proportion of the mag- 
nifying Power of any one of them, will be as the Square of the focal Diftance of the larger 
Concave is to the Rectangle under the focal Diftance of the lefTer Concave and the Eye-Glafies. 
In Dr BefaguHer''s appendix to the Second Edition of Dr David Gregory's Elements of Ca- 
topricks and Dioptricks } there is not only a more particular Defcription of the feveral Parts of 



Dr James Gregory '.f Refle&amp;ing Telefcope ^ Sec. 293 

this Refle&amp;ing Telefcope, for the fake of thofe who have a Mind to try at making it, but 
alfo two Tables for their Construction of other Dimenfions, which the Doctor received from 
Mr Hadley, which being curious and ufeful, and the Book fcarce, I fhall here fubjoin, 

The following Dimenfions in Fig. 15. are- each a fourth Part of a Telefcope of 12 Inches Fig. 15. 
fbcal Length. B B is a large concave Speculum, and AG is it's focal Length. F F is a 
fmaller concave Speculum, it's focal Length is I D. The Breadth F F is about T 'v of an 
Inch wider than the Hole C C in the larger Speculum. N, the firft Eye-Glafs, is Piano- 
Convex. S, the fecond Eye-Glafs, is Piano-Convex, or rather a Menifcus. M is a Plate 
with a fmall Mole in it to exclude all foreign Light, T ' F of an Inch. RR is the limiting 
Circle or Diaphragm? as it is fometimes called. The Arrows are the fucceffive Images of 
any Object. 

TABLE I. 

If AG be 3 Inches, or 12 Inches, of 18 Inches, or 27 Inches ; and the Charge or Power 
of magnifying is 12 % or 13 ; or 36, 49, 66? all correfpondently taken. Then will BB 
be 0.7, or 2, or 2.7, or 3.7. ID, 0.82, or 2.32, or 3.22, or 4.22. F F, 0.315, or 0.56, 
or 0.7, or 0.88. C C, 0.295, or 0.54, or 0.68, or o 86. The focal Diftance of N, 1.48, 
or 3.27, or 3.97, or 4.91. The focal Length of S, 0.7, or 1.3, or 1.54, or 1.85. AD*

or 0.53. 

Note, Thefe ExprefTions of Inches and Decimal Parts are for the Day, where Objects are 
to be magnified but a little, in proportion to what the heavenly Bodies may be at Night* 
for which the following Table gives the Proportions. 

TABLE II. 

If A G be either 12 Inches, or 18 Inches, or 27 Inches ; and the Charge be 70, or 95, 
or 128 Inches. Then muft B D be 2, or 2.7, or 3.75. ID, 1.74, or 2.36, or 3.22. FF, 
0.4, or 0.47, or 0.56. CC, 0.38, or 0.45, or 0.54. N, 2.29, or 2.79, or 3.47. The

or 0.29, or 0.36. 

Note, The Breadth in the Hole of the Plate M mufl be -^ of an Inch. And the vary- 
ing the Length of A N, the Diflance of the firft Eye-Glafs behind the fore Surface of the 
Speculum B B, alters the other Proportions but a little •, fo that if the Thicknefs of the 
Speculum, or other Circumftances require it, there is no need to keep exactly to the Num- 
bers here fet down for it. 

The Proportions of the fever al Parts of Gregory 's Reflecting Telefcope as computed by Mr Had- 
ley, Algebraically exprejfed ; with numerical Examples, when the focal Length is either 40 
Inches ', 60 Inches , or 90 Inches. 

Let (Fig. 16.) AD reprefent the common Axis of the Telefcope, and two concave Spe- Fig. 16. 
culums BB, F F ; fuppofe A G the focal Length of the Speculum B B, whofe proper Aper- 
ture B B, and Charge, are likewife known. Let C C be the Breadth of the Perforation. 
F F the Breadth of the fmaller Speculum, equal to, or a little greater than C C. I it's Focus. 
N the Eye-Glafs. N A it's focal Length, and M a Plate with a fmall Hole to exclude all 
foreign Light •, and let it be required to take in at one View fo much of the Object as may 
appear through the Telefcope, under a given Angle, viz. C N C. To do this with the 
Lofs of the fewefl Rays of Light near the Axis ; the Proportions mould be as follow.

Note. In the firft Table, C T at the Head of the firft Column is the focal Diftance of the 
great Speculum. C x is the Diftance of the fecond Image of the Object from the great Spe- 
culum. T c is the Diftance of the lefier Speculum from the Focus of the greater, c t is the 
focal Diftance of the leffer Speculum. C A half the Breadth of the greater Speculum, viz. 
the Chord of half it's Arch, c a or C B the Breadth of half the leffer Speculum, which is 
equal to half the Breadth of the Hole in the greater Speculum, x I is the focal Diftance of a 
fingle Eye-Glafs, that will magnify as much as the two Eye-Glaffes, fuppofe m, n, of the 
Telefcope. r is the Ratio of the Diftance of the Place of the fecond Image from the leffer 
Speculum to T c. 

The other Tables, with two more for Mr Cajfegrairi 's Reflecting Telefcope, I mail not 
infert here. 

If feveral Telefcopes of the fame Kind have nearly the fame Length, or the fame magni- 
fying Powers, though of different Kinds; thofe are the beft of their Kind by which you can 
read the fame print at the greateft Diftance, when that print is equally enlightened. 

The beft of thefe Kinds of Telefcopes that have been hitherto made has been by Mr Short. 
He has made fix with glafs Speculums quick filver'd behind, which fhew the Image very di- 
ftinclly, as the late Mr Maclaurin fays, three of 15 Inches focal Diftance, and three of 9 
Inches. The prefent Duke of Argyle had one of the 15 Inch ones, by which it is eafy to read 
in the Pbilofopbical TranfacJions at the Diftance of 230 Feet; and with one of the 9 Inch 
ones at the Diftance of 1 38 Feet. With another of thefe, at another Time, and with a fmaller 
Print, you may read at the Diftance of 125 Feet. He has alfo made thefe Telefcopes with 
metaline Speculums, which are very good. He has [made fome of 2 Inches and 6 Tenths 
focal Diftance ; others of 4, 6. 9, and 15 Inches. By thofe of 4 Inches the Satellites of Ju- 
piter may be ktn very well, and the Pbilofopbical TranfacJions may be read at 125 Feet Di- 
ftance. By thofe of 6 Inches focal Diftance you may read at 160 Feet Diftance. By thofe of 
9 Inches at 120 Feet. By thofe of 15 Inches focal Diftance you may read the faid Tranfac- 
tions at the Diftance of 500 Feet, and by it the five Satellites of Saturn have been feen toge- 
ther, which Mr CaJJini had fometimes feen with a 17 Foot Refracting Telefcope. See more 
particularly Mr Maclaurin % Letter to Dr Smith, dated at Edinburgh, Dec. 28. 1734, to be 
Jeen at Page 80. of the Remarks, at the End of Dr Smith's, fecond Volume of Opticks. 

The firft Thought we find in print concerning a Reflecting Telefcope, is that of Dr James 
Gregory, in his Optica Promota, publifhed in the Year 1663; who at Page 93, 94,-pro- 
pofes a Cata-Dioptrical Telefcope, in order to make Telefcopes fhorter, and more handy ; 
and this is the Defcription of it by himfelf. 

Let ADC E (Fig. 17.) be a parabolick concave Speculum moft exquifitely polifhed, in 
whofe Focus C is placed a fmall eliiptick concave Speculum, having a common Focus, and 
common Axis with the concave parabolick Speculum, and let it be fixed in that Situation. 
Now the faid Focus of that eliiptick Speculum muft be very near to it's vertex, and the other 
Focus of it muft be very far from the fame at F, in the common Axis produced beyond the 
parabolick Speculum •, and through the Vertex of the parabolick Speculum muft be made a 
round Hole M N, in which Hole muft be placed a Tube, having the fame Axis with the 
Speculums, and big enough to receive the Rays of a vifible Point or Object, reflected from 
the eliiptick concave Speculum •, and let it be continued to L very near to F, and at L let a 
Lens of cryftal Convex towards the Speculums be placed, with the Convexity of a Conoid, 
and the Denfity of the Cryftalline (of the Eye), whofe exterior Focus muft be at F, and 
which muft be plane towards the Eye, and likewife have the fame common Axis as the Spe- 
culums and the Tube. This will be the Way to make an excellent Telefcope for purblind 
Eyes ; for diftant Objects feen through the Tube, will appear diftinctly magnified very near 
in the Ratio of the Diftances of the Vertexes from the common Focus, and enlightened in the 
fame Manner as a vifible Object would be, when feen under fuch an Angle ; provided the 
Diameter of what produces the laft Image be big enough to fuffer the Uvea of the Eye to be 
filled with the Rays. And how that may done, we have taught in the Scholium of the 51ft of 
this Book, fays the Doclor. But it is plain, by what Dr Gregory has here faid, and by the 
Date of his Book, viz. in 1663, that he moft certainly was the firft Hinter and Founder of 
fuch an Inftrument, thereby giving Occafion to others to purfue and improve upon his 

Original,

Original, with fuch Alterations or Additions, as would beft make the Thing fuccced in 
actual Practice. 

Sir Ifaac Newton himfelf tells us, in the Pbilofophical Tranfaclions, Numb. 80. that he 
had confidered this Telefcope of Dr Gregory's, as above defcribed in the Optica Proviota - y 
and this was not 'till the Year 1668. That he refolved, before he attempted any thing in 
the Practice, to alter Dr Gregory's Defign, and place the Eye-Glafs at the iide of the Tube, 
rather than in the middle. 

Dr Gregory never brought his Telefcope to any Degree of Perfection, but owning his 
Want of Skill in Mechanicks, only propofes it for others to execute ; he had, indeed, an 
Object-Speculum of Metal ground to a Segment of a Sphere, and a little Concave, as well 
as a little Convex-Speculum, ground by Rives and Cox, two Optick Glafs-Gtindcrs of Lon- 
don, famous in thofe Days. But becaufe the Object-Metal was not well polifhed, he only 
made fome imperfect Trials, not fo much as even fitting the Speculums and Eye-Glafs in- 
fo a Tube •, and being difcouraged, as much becaufe he could not have the Object-Metal 
ground into a parabolick Concave, as becaufe that which he trird was not well polifhed, he 
gave over the Thoughts of bringing fuch Telefcopes into Ufe. See his Letter to Mr Collins* 
written from Si Andrews, Sept. 23, 1672, to be found in Dr Defaguliers's Appendix to Dr 
David Gregory's Opticks, at Numb. 4. 

Of late Years feveral Perfons have endeavoured to make large Telefcopes of this Kind, 
but I never heard they ever fucceeded ; and I muft confefs, that thefe Inftruments, though 
they have the Advantage of magnifying, and being more manageable, yet do not fhew the 
Objects fo diftinctly and bright (which are the two chief Things for which all Telefcopes are 
Ufed, and valuable), as refracting Telefcopes do, which are longer •, befides the Trouble of 
making thefe Inftruments, hazard of fpoiling them, and their Expence, are Confederations 
of fome Weight •, nor can they be ufed, in fome aftronomical Obfervations, where a Mi- 
crometer is neceffary, becaufe a Micrometer cannot eafily be applied to one of them j tho\ 
indeed, there is a Contrivance to do it in the Pbilofophical Tranfaclions. Numb. 475.

H E Inflrument (Fig. 18.) confifts of a metaline Speculum, about fix Inches in Dia- 
meter ; the Radius of the Sphere on which it's concave Surface was ground is 10 Feet 
5 4 Inches, and it's focal Length is 62 ~ Inches. The back has a hollow Screw made at 
it's Centre to receive the End of a Handle which is fcrewed on wherever the Metal is to be 
moved, in order to avoid fullying it's polifhed Surface by handling. The Object-Metal A 
is placed in one End of an octangular Tube B B about 6 Feet long, dyed black on the Irr- 
fide ; about 6 or 7 Inches in Length of the three uppermoft Sides of the Tube C towards 
that End at which the Metal is placed, are feperated from the reft, and open with two 
Hinges to make room for the Metal to be put in, or taken out ; the End of the Tube is 
clofed by an octangular Piece of Board D, which has an opening about 4 of an Inch 
broad, from the Top, down to a little below the Center, to give room for the before- 
mentioned Handle, when the Object-Metal is lifted into, or out of, the Tube ; at other 
Times it is clofed with a Aiding Shutter ; the Metal is placed fo as to have it's Axis coincide 
with that of the Tube, by the Means of three fmall Buttons fixed to the Infide of the Tube, 
having their hinder Ends all in the fame Plane to which this Axis is Perpendicular ; two of 
thefe appear at a a, the third being at the middle of the Bottom of the Tube, is not feen ; 
the forefide of the Metal refts againft thefe Buttons in three Points of it's Circumference, 
nearly equidiftant from each other, and is held in them by three Screws, one of which ap- 
pears at b, which run through the octangular Board at the End of the Tube, and bear 
againft the Back of the Metal, in three Points, which directly anfwer thofe three on the 
forefide, with juft fo much Force as is requifite to keep it fteady in it's place -, they muft 
not be fcrewed harder againft the Metal for fear of bending it, which, though it is half an 
Inch in Thicknefs, a very little Force is fufHcient to do : when the Inflrument is not ufed, 
thefe Screws are loofened, and the Object-Metal is taken out and laid by to prevent it's 
tarnifhing. 

The oval Plane (Fig. 19.) is compofed of a Plate of the fame Metal with the great Spe- 
culum, about T * T or ~ of an Inch in Thicknefs, foldercd on the Back to another of Brafs ; 

it's 



Of Sir Ifaac Newton'* Refle&amp;ing Tekfcope, &amp;c. 297 

it's Breadth is fomething lefs than half an Inch, and is in the Ratio to it's Length, As t is' 
to the fquare Root of 2, or as the Side of a Square is to it's Diagonal 5 at one End of the 
Oval, the Brafs Plate projects a little beyond the other, and has a Screw cut through it in 
that part, as alfo another directly againft the Centre of the forefide •, the other End is cyphered 
away on the backfide, that it may intercept as few of the Rays in their Paffage towards the 
Object-Metal as poffible. The two Screw-Holes in the back (Figure) ferve to fix this Oval 
A, to a Brafs Arm B, which is faftened at the other End into a Slider EE (Fig. 18, 19.); Fig. 18, 19: 
this Slider is of an equal Thicknefs with the Side of the Tube, and has a Groove G G 
(Fig. 18.) cut for it in that fide parallel to the Axis, and long enough to give room for it's 
Motion, to fet the Speculums at. the different Diftances, which the feveral Eye-GlafTes re- 
quire ; it rells on the Infide againft two thin Ledges, faftened within the Tube along the 
Sides of the Groove •, on the Outfide, it is kept in it's place, by a Aiding Shutter not ex- 
panded in the Figure. In the middle (Fig. 19.) it has a cylindrical Cavity D, whofe Axis is Fig. 19. 
perpendicular to it's inner and outer Surfaces •, each of the Boxes in which the Eye-GlafTes 
are contained, is fitted to this Cavity -, the beforementioned Brafs Arm is fixed into the In- 
fide of this Slider, towards the End fartheft from the Object-Metal •, it rifes perpendicularly 
for about two Inches, and is made flat, fo as to turn one Edge to the Rays which come 
from the Object ; about b it is bent forwards, and flatted the other way, fo that when the 
back of the oval Plane is held flat to it by the two Screws c c, the Axis of the cylindrick 
Cavity may fall on the Centre of it's forefide, inclined to it's Surface in an Angle fome- 
thing lefs than 45 Degrees ; this Angle is brought to be exact by two very fmall Screws i r, 
whofe Threads take hold in the flatted End of the Brafs Arm, and their Points bearing 
againft the back of the Oval, raife one End of it a little from the flat of the Arm. The Spe- 
culums are fa at their due Diftance by turning a long Screw C C, for which there is a 
Nut lodged in the Slider at g ; the Screw is kept from moving backwards or forwards, 
when it is turned, by a Brafs Plate F, which is to be fixed to the flat End of the Side of 
the Tube, and taken off at Pleafure. Each of the Eye-Glafs Boxes H, has a Screw on the 
outward End to fallen to it a Bowl or Dilh I, to receive the Ball of the Eye, and guard it 
from external Light. 

On the Top of the Tube a common Dioptrick Telefcope H is fixed upon two fmall 
Pillars, about i3 Inches long, with it's Axis parallel to that of the Tube ; with two fmall 
Hairs in the common Focus of the Object and Eye Glaftls ; eroding one another in it's 
Axis. 

There are three convex Eye-Glaffes belonging to the Inftrumcnt •, the firft, or fhalloweft, 
has it's focal Diftance of abou: \ of an Inch ; the fecond of ^ ; and the deepeft of ~ •, or 
fomething lefs. When the fiifl of thefe is 11 fed with the Inftrument, it magnifies about i88 s 
or 190 Times in Diameter ; with the fecond, about 208, and with the third about 228., or 
230 : Each of thefe GlalTes has placed in that Focus neareft the Oval, a Circle to determine 
the part of the Object feen at one View ; and in the other Focus towards the Eye, a Brafs 
Plate with a little Hole in the middle, to let no Light pafs to the Eye from the Infide of 
the Tube, but what comes from the Oval : befides thefe three convex, there are two con- 
cave Eye-Glaffes with which it magnifies about 200, or 220 times ; and alfo a Set of three 
convexes, which turn it into a Day Telefcope, magnifying about 125 times. The Aperture is 
limitted by a Circle of Card or Pafte-board placed before the Object-Metal in the Tube. To 
vary the Apertures, there are three of thefe Circles, and the Apertures altered by them are 
five Inches and a half, five Inches, and four and an half, though for fome Objects, the 
whole Tube may be left open. 

Thus far is the particular Defcription of the Body and main Parts of the Telefcope, as 
js to be found in the Philofophical Tranfaftions, Numb. 376. As to the particular Defcrip- 
tion of the wooden Support to direct the Tube to any Object which is there given I fhall 
omit, the Figure thereof being fufficient to fatisfy all thofe who have not fuch a Telefcope, 
and have no Defire of making it ; befides, it is in any one's Power almoft to invent a Sup- 
port for the Body of the Inftrument, and that, perhaps, different from this here, of Mr 
Hadley's ; there is no great ingenuity in doing it. 

Mr Hadley tells us, this Inftrument when tried at an Object feen in the Day-Time, feems 
to bear an Aperture of five Inches and an half, with the deepeft of the aforementioned 
Eye-GlafTes, as well as the common Telefcopes do the ufual Charge and Aperture given to 
them, except that in thefe the Objects appear a little brighter. 

Drs Pound and Bradley fay, that this Telefcope will bear fuch a Charge as to make it 
magnify the Object as many Times as Mr Huygens's dioptrick Telefcope, the focal Length 
of whofe Object-Glafs is 123 Feet, and that it reprefents Objects as diftinct, though not al- 
together fo clear and bright. 

1 have always thought, that thefe catadioptrick Telefcopes of both Kinds, do reprefent 
Objects more obfeurely than refracting Telefcopes, though indeed in this the Newtonian one 
has the Advantage of Dr Gregory's ; and that they will always do fo, unlefs a reflecting Sub- 
ftance for a concave can be found, that will reflect as much Light as Glafs tranfmits, which 
I take to be impoffible. For I ever faw the Image of an Object in the Focus of a concave 
Speculum more indiftinct and obfeure than the Object itfelf, (which argues the Lofs of Rays 

4 H by 



298 Sir Ifaac Newton V Reflecting Telefcope y &amp;c. 

by the Reflection) or than an Object appearing by the Reflection of a plane Speculum •, 
whereas an Object feen through a Glafs-Lens will appear more enlightened and bright than 
even it does with the naked Lye. 

_^ Mr Huygens fays, that he had never found any Speculums that had fo good a Polifh as 
Glafs ; and fo fays Sir Ifaac Newton, and accordingly he recommends glafs Speculums quick- 
filvered over, as preferable to metalline ones. 

In the fecond Volume of Dr Smith's Opticks, beginning at pag. 363. there is a Reflecting 
Telefcope of Sir Ifaac Newton's Form, made, and defcribed by Samuel Molyneux, Efq; and 
fent by him as a Prefent to his Majefty John V. King of Portugal, being or ^a much Ampler 
Conftruction than that of Mr Hadley's, and magnifies as much, and as diftinctly, as a Refrac- 
ting Telefcope of 35 or 40 Feet. So fays Dr Smith. 

And at ^ Numb. 918, pag. 36;. there foiiows a ver-y Arrange and Angular Affcrtion of Dr 
Smith's, viz. he fays, that one's Imagination is always milled in comparing the Effects of 
this Inftrument with Refracting ones of that Length. For although (fayslie) by the Mi- 
nutenefs of the Parts viable in the Object obferved ; as alfo, by the Proportions between the 
focal Diftance of the Eye-Glafs made ufe of, and the focal Difbance of the great Speculum it 
is demonftrable, that the Diftinctnefs and magnifying Power thereof exceeds that of a Re- 
fracting Telefcope of 35 Feet, yet the Spedtator will always fancy that the Refractor has 
the Advantage of this Inftrument. And again, that it will be certainly found to be but a 
Deception, and probably an univerfal one to all Perfons. Now, is not the Doctor here ra- 
ther deceived himfelf. For to prefer optical Demonftrations, founded upon dubious Princi- 
ples (which I think his are, about the apparent Diftinction, and brightnefs of Objects) ra- 
ther than to the Experience of all Men,, is too bold an Affertion. And one would be almoft 
led to believe, that the Doctor would have Reflecting Telefcopes, right or wrong, to be bet- 
ter than Refracting ones, as to the Diftinctnefs of the Objects appearing throu°h them.

A Defcription of the RefieEiing Telefcope, made by Sir Ifaac Newton 

himfelf. 



o 



E made two fmall ones, with an Object metal fpherically concave, the fecond being 
better than the other ; the word of which he defcribes in the Philofophical Tranfaflions, 
(at Numb. 80.) and the other he fent to the Royal Society. This worft was not long ago to 
be feen at Mr Heath's, the Mathematical Inftrument Maker in the Strand, having upon it, 
wrote with his own Hand, Ifaac Newton. 
Fig. 20. A B (Fig. 20.) is the concave Speculum, of which the Radius or Semidiameter is 12 \ or 

13 Inches. CD is another metalline Speculum, whofe Surface is flat, and the Circumference 
oval. G D is an iron Wire, holding a Ring of Brafs, in which the Speculum C D is fixed. 
F is a fmall Eye-Glafs, fiat above, and convex below, of the twelfth Part of an Inch Radius, 
if not lefs ; forafmuch as the Metal collects the Sun's Rays at 6 4. Inches diftance from it's 
vertex. G G G the fore-part of the Tube is fattened to a brafs Ring H I to keep it immove- 
able. P CMC L is the hind-part of the Tube fattened to another brals Ring P Q^ O is an iron 
Hook fattened to the Ring P Q_, and furnifhed with a Screw N. Thereby to advance or 
draw Back the hind-part of the Tube, and fo by that means to put the Speculums to their 
due Diftance. M QjG is a crooked Iron fuftaining the Tube, and fattened by the Nail R to 
the Ball and Socket S, whereby the Tube may be turned every way. The Centre of the 
flat Speculum C D muft be placed in the fame Point of the Tube's Axis V T where falls the 
Perpendicular to this Axis drawn to the fame, from the Centre of the Eye-Glafs, which 
Point is here marked at T. 

The Tube of this Telefcope is open at the End which refpects the Object, the other End 
is clofe, where the faid Concave is laid. The flat oval Speculum is near the open End, made 
as fmall as may be,- the lefs to obftruct the Entrance of the Rays of Light, where is a little 
Hole furnifhed with the faid fmall plano-convex Eye-Glafs. So that the Rays coming from 
the Object do firft fall on the Concave placed at the Bottom of the Tube, and are thence re- 
flected towards the other End of it, where they meet with the flat Speculum obliquely pofited, 
by the Reflection of which they are directed to the little plano-convex Glafs ; and fo to the Spec- 
tator's Eye, who looking downward fees the Object which the Telefcope is turned to. 

This Telefcope will magnify as to Surface about 38 Times, viz. as much as a refracting Te- 
lefcope of 2 Feet, and by it you may read in the Philofophical TranfcMiuns, at the Diftance of 
too or 120 Feet. 

Sir 



Of MICRO SCO P ES. z 99 

Sir Ifaac Newton, in his Opticks, page 95, gives another Defcript4on of a Reflecting Te- 
lefcope, which fee there. 

A little after Sir Ifaac Newton had fent his Telefcope to the Royal Society, Mr Oldenburgh, 
the Secretary, wrote him a Letter of Thanks, to which Sir Ifaac 'Newton made Anfwer in 
167', giving a farther Account of the Inflrument. 

About this Time Dr James Gregory having an Account of Sir Ifaac Newton's Telefcope^ 
wrote his Thoughts about it to Mr Collins, in a Letter from Aberdeen, dated Auguft 6. 1672. 
In which he gives the Preference to Sir Ifaac's Telefcope, above that which he defcribed in the 
Optica Promota, in one rcfpecl, but thinks his own better in another. At the fame Time one 
Mr Cajfegraine, a French Man, publifhed a Defcription of a Catadioptrick Telefcope, as his 
own Invention, which he pretended had been prior to Sir Ifaac's Telefcope. Sir Ifaac contrived 
his in the Year 1666, and executed it in the Year 1670, or 1671. And indeed Dr James 
Gregory his before either of them, viz. before 1663. This Telefcope of Mr Cafjegraine's dif- 
fers nothing from the Doclor's, excepting that he would have the fmall Metal to be convex* 
whereas in that of the other it is concave ; but I never heard that an Inftrument of this Kind 
was ever yet made. See an Account of it, in the Pbilofophical Tranfaclions, at Numb. 83. 
In the fecond Volume of Dr Smith's Opticks, amongft the Remarks, page 105. he fays, that 
what Trials have been made of Mr Cajfegraine' 's Form he knows not ; but it appears by a Table 
there fetdown, for the Parts of this Telefcope, compared to another there let down for the 
Parts of Gregory's Telefcope, that the former has the Advantage, oeing fhorter by twice the 
focal Diftance of the leffer Speculum, and yet magnifies more. 

Sir Ifaac Newton fays, the Telefcope he made, was but 6 Inches long, bears fome- 
thing more than an Inch Aperture, with a plano-convex Eye-Glafs, which is 4 or 4- Part of 
an Inch in depth, fo that it magnifies about 40 Times in Diameter, which he thinks is more 
than any 6 Foot Tube can do with Diftinctnefs ; but (fays he) by reafon of bad Materials, 
and for want of a good Polifh, it reprefents Things not fo diftinctly as a 6 Foot Tube will 
do-, yet he thinks it will difcover as much as any 3 or 4 Foot Tube, efpecially if thofe Objects 
be luminous ; and fays, he has feen with ft Jupiter diftinctly round, and his Satellites and 
Venus horned. He doubts not but in Time a 6 Foot Reflecting Telefcope of this fort may 
be made, which will perform as much as any 60 or 100 Feet Refracting Telefcope. That a 
Refracting Telefcope, made of the pureft Glafs, exquifitely polifhed with the beft Figure any 
Geometrician has or can defign, would fcarce perform as much more as an ordinary good Te- 
lefcope of the fame Length, 13 c. This is part of a Letter written by Sir Ifaac Newton, from 
Trinity College, Cambridge, dated Feb. 23. 166,;. to a Friend. See page 259. ofDr DefagU' 
lier's Appendix to Dr David Gregory's Elements of Opticks. 



C H A P. IX. 
Of MICRO SCOPES. 

THESE moft pleafing and ufeful Inftruments for enlarging and viewing very fmall Ob- 
jects, and their Parts, not perceivable by the naked Eye (by reafon of their Smallnefs, 
and Deficiency in reflecting Light from them to the Eye) and thereby difcovering many fur- 
prizing Kinds of minute Animals, wonderful in Shape and Motion, as well as fome of the 
Texture, Contrivance, and Structure of natural Bodies, and their Parts, are of two Sorts, 
viz. fingle, which confifl of one very fmall Lens, or Globe of Glafs or Water, put near to 
the Eye, or compound ones, confifting of two or three Lenfes. 

Mr Huygens, in his little Tract upon Microfcopes, in his Dioptricks, beginning at page 
221, fhews, how to make the fmall Glafs Globes for fingle Microfcopes, by melting powdered 
Glafs in the Flame of a Lamp, which will run into various fmall Globes, and making Choice of 
fuch as he found beft, which he put into fmall round Holes, made in a very thin Copper 
Plate, punched with a Needle, and thofe he liked beft he fixed therein ; thus eafily making fe- 
veral Microfcopes. The well figuring, and polifhing fuch very fmall Globes, being much 
more owing to Chance than Defign. 

Mr Stephen Gray ufed Drops of Water, placed near the Eye, for fingle Microfcopes. See 
the Pbilofophical Tranfaclions, Numb. 221, 223. 

Mr Leewenhoeck of Delft in Holland, was doubtlefs the greateft Judge of the beft Kind 
of Microfcopes, as well as the greateft Mafter in theUfeof the Inftrument, and has obliged 
the World with the greateft Difcoveries by it of any Man that I know, yet he prefers fingle 
Microfcopes to compound ones, as may be feen in the Account of Martin Folkes, Efq-, given 
of Mr Leewenhoeck' s Glafles, which by his Will he left to the Royal Society. See Numb. 380. 
Aljb a further Account of Mr Leewenhoeck^ Microfcopes, by the 'ingenious Mr Henry Barker % 
is to be feen at Numb. 458. of the Pbilofophical Tranfaclions for the Year 1 740. This great 

Man 



300 Of MICROSCOPES. 

Man preferred Diftinction to great Degrees of magnifying, in which he mod certainly was 
right •, for what fignifies augmenting the Bulk or an Objedt, if it and it's Parts cannot be 
diftinctly and clearly feen •, confequently, thofe are the bed Microfcopes, whether iingle or 
double, thac do this the beft. And within thefe ioo Years there have been a vaft Variety of 
thefe Inftruments made (fome fingle, fome double) by ingenious Workmen in England, 
Italy, Holland, &amp;c. To many, and much difperfed, that few Perfons can really tell which 
are beft. Many of them may be good enough, as to the Perfection of the Glalfes, but they 
differ in the lefTer effential Contrivances, viz. to move them to the Object, to caft Light 
upon, and to hold the Object, with the greatcft Eafe and belt Convenience. 

The Lenfes of fingle Microfcopes are from /,,- of an Inch, to in Diameter ; the man- 
ner of making them by one Mr Butterfield, of the Bignefs of great Pins Heads, or lefs, is 
to be feen in the Philofophical Tranfaclions, Numb. 141. Dr Hook ufed to take a clear Piece 
of Glafs, and draw it out into long Threads in a Lamp, then he held thefe Threads in the 
Flame 'till they run into round Globules hanging to the End of the Threads •, and having 
fixed the Globules with Wax to the End of a Stick, fo that the Threads flood upwards, he 
ground the Ends of the Threads upon a Whetftone, and polifhed them upon a fmooth 
metal Plate, with a little Putty. Mr Gray makes them fomewhat otherwife, See the Philo- 
fophical Tr an fail ions, Numb. 221, 223, who fays, That fmall round Globules magnified 
and fliewed Objects clearer than Hemifpheres. Dr Hook fays, he made ufe of a double Mi- 
crofcope in moft of his Obfervations. See the Preface to his Micrography : and to enlighten 
his Objects as much as poffible, he made choice of a Room with but one Window towards 
the South, where at the Diftance of 3 or 4 Feet from the Window he placed his double 
Microfcope upon a Table, and by a Glafs Globe full of Water, and a thick plano-convex 
Lens he threw the Light upon the Object ; or when the Sun fhone, he placed a Piece of oiled 
Paper very near the Object, and with a very large Burning-Glafs he threw the -Sun's Rays 
upon the Paper, fo as that a great Quantity of them might be tranfmitted through it to the 
Object •, but the Paper being fubject to take Fire, if the Focus of the Rays fell upon it, 
inftead thereof he put a Piece of plane Glafs, not polifhed, but only rough ground with fine 
Sand, which when warmed gradually would endure much more Heat than the oiled Paper; 
and fo would fuffer more Light to pafs through it to the Object ; and by this means fays he, 
the Sun's Light was more equally diffufed upon the Parts of the Object than the Sun's direct 
Light. In the Night-Time he illuminated his Object with the Light of a Lamp, firft re- 
fracted through his Globe full of Water, or clear Erine, which refracts more than Water, 
and then collected into a fmaller Spot upon the Object by a plano-convex Lens. He alfo 
placed a polifhed concave Metal on the Side of the Lamp oppofite to the Globe, to reflect 
part of the Rays upon the Globe-, and thus he fays he could illuminate an Object with a 
fmall Lamp as much as it would well bear, and he drew moft of the Reprefentations of 
Objects by the Light of his Lamp. 

Note, A double Microfcope contrived for viewing Objects by Sun-fhine is called by fome 
of the Moderns, a folar Microfcope ; and without difpute, Objects viewed in Sun-fhine will 
be beft perceived and diftinguifhed, provided the Sun-fhine be not too great, or the Eye 
dazzled by the Glare. 

I have already hinted, that the World is now full of Microfcopes, fome better, fome 
worfe. Mr Wilfon's Pocket Microfcope defcribed in the Philofophical franf anions, Numb.

Microfcope, difcribed in Dr Harris's, Lexicon. Mr Culpepper's and Scarlat's, Mr Muffchen-

the Dimenfions for making one ; but I have heard the Contrivance will not do well.

A Jhort Account of fome Inflruments either of lefs general Ufe y whofe 
full Defcriptions are too long to infert in this Appendix, or fuch as 
with fome Alterations or Additions of Parts are already defcrtbed in 
this Book. 

I. A Meridian Tele/cope. 

THIS is a Telefcope fixed at right Angles to an Axis, and turned about it In the 
Plane of the Meridian. Dr Halley had one of thefe ; another of them was contrived 
by Mr Cotes, and the prefent Duke of Argyle has a very good one. See their Defcription in 
Dr Smith's Opticks, Vol. II. Book iii. Chap. 6. The Uie of thefe Instruments is for find- 
ing Time, by obferving when the Sun or any Star has equal Altitudes on each Side of the 
Meridian ; as alio for finding the Time of their Appulfes to the Meridian. And thence by 
means of a Clock, and the computed right Afcenfion of the Sun at that Time by the Clock, 
or that of a Star, we have the Difference between a Day reckoned by the Clock, and that 
of the Sun or Stars. Dr Halley at fii if made all his Obfervations of the right Afcenfions of 
the Moon by fuch an Inftrument ; his Telefcope was 5 t Feet long, and the tranfverfe Axis 
above three Feet. 

There are other Inflruments that will do this, one of which is defcribed in a little Folid 
Tract of Mr Molyneux's, printed at London in the Year 1700, entituled Sciothericum Tele- 
fcopicum : being a large horizontal Dial with a Telefcope adapted to it. Such an Inftru- 
ment was made in London, by Mr Richard Whitehead, in the Year 1685. This Inftrument 
gives the Hour, almolt by Inflection, by a Star, as well as by the Sun ; it has alfothis Ad- 
vantage, that when the Sun is over-clouded fb as juft to be feen faintly, and cafts no Sha- 
dow at all upon a Dial, yet if the Sun be in the kaft perceivable by the Eyej the Time 
may be exactly told by him. Thi Contrivance in brief is thus. It is a very large Brafs 
horizontal Dial made to the Latitude ot the Place it is to be ufed in, with a ftrong double 
Gnomon, calling the Morning Shadow from it's Weftern Edge, and the Afternoon Shadow 
from it's Ealtern Edge, and the Noon Shadow by it's Thicknefs ; it has two Pair of Sights, 
or Rulers, one Pair ferving for the Morning, or for Stars that are to the Eaft of the Meri- 
dian •, and the other Pair to ferve in the Afternoon, or for Stars on the Weftern Side of the 
Meridian ; each of thefe Pair of Sights confifls of two moveable Rulers, called the horizon- 
tal Ruler, and the Gnomonick one, by Mr Mclyneux ; which Rulers are fo adapted, as that 
their two Edges which are next to the Gnomon, are always in the fame Plane with each 
other •, and at the Time of Obfervation, that they both may be in the fame Plane with their 
correfpondent Edge of the Gnomon •, and on the Style-Ruler are fixed Telefcopick Sights 
with the Crofs-Hairs in their proper Place. The horizontal Ruler turns exactly about the 
Centre of the Hour- Lines ; and to the other End of it, the Style-Ruler is adapted by means 
of a Joint, fo as to have two Motions, the one upwards or downwards, and another Eaft- 
ward and Wcftard, according as it follows the horizontal Ruler. 

II. An Equatorial Telefcope. 

The ingenious Mr Short (in the Philosophical Tranfatlions, at Numb. 493, for the Year 
1749.) gives the Delcription and Ufes of an Inftrument confifting of a Combination of feve- 
ral Circles, with two Spirit-Levels, and a Reflecting Telefcope, which will ferve for a Dial ; 
an equal Altitude Inftrument, a Tranfit Inftrument, a Theodolite, a Quadrant, an Azimuth 
Inftrument, and a Level. He fays, he has made three of thefe Inflruments, one of which 
he fold to Count Bentinck, for the Ufe of the late Prince of Orange. That he had the other 
two by him. That he docs not pretend to any thing new in the Combinations of the Circles 
of which the Inftrument confifls. The fame C ombinations having feveral Times before been 
made by way of Dial •, but believes the putting fo large a Telefcope upon the Machinery, 
and applying it to the Ufes he has done, is fomewhat new. 

III. The Micrometer. 

Any Micrometer, of which there are feveral Sorts, well made, may be fufficient to mea- 
fure (mall Angles fubtended by remote Objects at the naked Eye ; to do which is the chief 
Bufineis of this Infirument. 

4 I The 



30Z A fhort Account of fotne InftrumentS) Sec. 

The old Micrometer of Mr Townley's, improved by Dr Hook (and long fince defcribed in 
the Pbilofopbical Tranfaclions, Numb. 29.) and it's Ufcs in Numb. 25. appears to have been 
good, or elk Sir Ifaac Newton would not, at the Beginning of the third Book of his Matbe* 
matical Principles of Natural Philofophy, have ventured to fet down the Meafurcs of the Di- 
ftances of the Satellites of Jupiter, from Jupiter's Center, as taken by Mr Townhy with 
that Micrometer. This to me is a fufficient Proof of the Exactnefs of that old Inftrurrienc. 
As to Facility of Ufe, and fome other leiler Advantages, other more modern Micrometers 
have been made and defcribed. And Dr Smith, in his Opticks, Vol. II. Chap. 8. Book 2 
defcribes a Micrometer, which he calls one of the beft Sort. The Micrometer, and" it's Ufe 
is alfo treated of by Mr Auzont, a Frenchman •, by Mr Hevelius, in the Ac! a Eruditorum 
Anno 1708; by Mr Balthafaris, and others. Scarcely, in my Opinion, deferving a particu- 
lar Account here. What our Author and myfelf having already faid upon thislnftrument 
appearing to me to be enough. 

IV. Of Mr. GrahamV Aflronomical Sector. 
This Inftrument is for obferving the Place of a Planet or Comer, by takin^ the Differences 
of it's right Afcenfion, and Declination, from thofe of a known fixed Star -,° when it cannot 
be done at all by a Micrometer, or not conveniently by a large Quadrant or Sextant, the 
Contriver in brief is thus. 
P&lt;atei. L et AI5 (Plate 2. Fig. 21.) reprefent an Arch of a Circle containing 10 or 12 Degrees, 

F, g- 2I - having a long Plate C D for its Radius fixed to the middle of the Arch at D. Let this Radi- 
us be applied to the fide of an Axis H F I, and be moveable about a Joint fixed to it at F 
fo as the Plane of the Sector may be always parallel to the Axis H I, which being parallel to 
the Axis of the Earth, the Plane of the Sector will always be parallel to the Plane of fome 
Hour Circle. Let a Telefcope C E be moveable about the Centre C of the Arch A B, from 
one end of it to the other, by turning a Screw at G, and let the Line of Sight be parallel to 
the Plane of the Sector ; then by turning the whole Inftrument about the Axis H I, 'till the 
Plane of it fuccefilvely directed, firft to one of the Stars, and then to another, it is eafy to 
move the Sector about the Joint F into fuch a Pofition, that the Arch AB when fixed, mall 
take in both Stars in their PaiTage by the Plane of it, if the Difference of their Declination 
does not exceed the Arch A B. Then having fixed the Plane of the Sector a little to the Weft- 
ward of both the Stars, move the Telefcope C E by the Screw G, and obferve by a Clock 
the Time of each Tranfit over the crofs Hairs ; and alfo the Degrees and Minutes upon the 
Arch A B, cut by the Index at each Tranfit. Then is the Difference of the Arches, the Dif- 
ference of the Declinations, and by the Difference of the Times, we have the Difference of the 
right Afcenfions of the Stars* See a more particular Defcription of this Inftrument in the 
ninth Chapter of the third Book of Dr Smith's Opticks, Vol. II. 

V. Of Mr S'iffon's Theodolite. 

This is certainly the beft, moft complete, handfome, and well defigned Inftrument pofli- 
ble, not only ferving as a Theodolite to take horizontal Angles, but likewife to take vertical 
Angles as a Quadrant •, and befides, may be ufed to take the Levels of Places, all with 
Speed, Eafe, and fufficient Exactnefs, for moft of the common Purpofes for which it is de- 
defigned. See more particularly, concerning the fame, in Mr Lawrence's Surveying. 

There is likewife another very good Theodolite, made by Mr Heath the Mathematical Inftru- 
ment Maker, whofe Ufes are to be feen in Hammond's Surveying, wrote in reality by the late 
very ingenious Mr Samuel Cunn (who being a Butcher, that kept a Butcher's Shop in New- 
port Market) was alfo a very great Mathematician : One of the beft Meafurers of Artificers 
Works, Surveyors of Land, and Expounders of Euclid, and Apollonius, in the World. 

VI. Mr Barfton'j Univerfal Aflronomical Quadrant, (as he calls it) is an Inftrument con- 
trived to take the Altitudes of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, without a vifible Horizon, with the 
greateft Accuracy, as well as Speed, as the Author himfelf will have it. The Inftru- 
ment confifts of a Semicircle, with half its Arch, divided into 90 Degrees, having a Tele- 
fcope upon the Diameter, and Wheel-work incloftd within the Inftrument, which turns tw^ 
fmall Hands about, pointing at the Divifions of two circular Arches, on that Radius of the 
Quadrant, or rather Semicircle at right Angles to the Diameter of the Semicircle, which Divi- 
fions give the Degrees and Minutes of Altitude. The Contrivance of fuch a Quadrant to take 
Altitudes at once is not new. I heard of one, it is now almoft fifty Years ago, which was 
then called by the Name of a Ketch-Quadrant. They were well known, and commonly 
talked of amongft a Society of ingenious Mathematicians, that met together once a Week in 
London, from the Year 17 10 to 1724. But I won't fay thefe Kerch-Quadrants were exactly 
the fame as to Structure, with thofe of Mr Barfton. His may poflibly be better. He got 
a Patent for the fole making and felling them •, and they were made and fold by Mr Jofcph 
Turner, z Watch-Maker in Hat ton Garden, London, with the Names of John Barfton and 
Jofeph Turner engraved upon the Limb.

A Jhort Account of fome Inftruments, &amp;c. 303 

VII. Dr Hook, Samuet Molyneux, Efq; and Dr Bradley, our pfefent Royal Profefibr of 
Aftronomy, had each an Inftrument tor trying to difcover the annual Parallax of the fixed 
Stars. Mr Molyneux's Inftrument was a Telelcope of 25 Feet long, with a fquare Tube, 
contrived to fwing in a vertical Pofition by two polifhed Cylinders fixed near the top of the 
Tube, fo that their common Axis, if produced through the Tube, would pafs at right An- 
cles to it's Axis through a Point near the Centre of the Object-Glafs. When the Telefcope 
turned upon thofe Cylinders, it's Axis of Vifion moved like a Pendulum in the Plane or the 
Meridian, while a fine long Wire hung down by the fide of the Tube, whofe Loop was put 
over one of the Cylinders, was gently ftretched by a Plummet immerfed in a Veffel of Wa- 
ter, defigned to retard it's Vibrations. The lower End of this Wire played gently againft 
the' fmoo'th fide of a flender Brafs Plate fixed crofs-ways to the fide of the Tube, fo as to point 
Northwards and Southwards ; and in the middle of this Plate was punched a very fine 
round Hole, a little broader than the Thicknefs of the Wire. The Telefcope was gradually 
moved upon it's Axis of Sufpcnfion, by the Prefiure of a long Screw, divided into fine 
Threads, like that of a Micrometer, which worked in the Hole of a Plate fixed to the Wall 
of the Houfe, and the Tube was made to bear againft the end of this Screw by a Weight 
fixed to the end of a String pafiing over a Pulley having it's other end tied to a Hook fixed 
in the fide of the Tube. The oppofite end of that long Screw was fixed like an Axis in 
the Centre of a Brafs Wheel, whofe Circumference was divided into a great Number of equal 
Parts, while an Index fixed to an upright Board pointed to the Divifions of the Wheel. 

Now while the Wheel was gently turned, the part of the Wire which played againft the 
Crofs-Plate was viewed through a double Microfcope, 'till the little Hole in this Plate ap- 
peared to be bifected by the Wire. The Telefcope being by this means placed verticle, and 
rectified immediately before the beginning of every Obfervation of the Tranfit of the bright 
Star in the Head of the Dragon, which pafies very near the Zenith of Keiv, (for viewing 
of which this Inftrument was contrived and fet up in the Year 1725, at Kew near Richmond) 
and the Divifion of the Wheel over againft the Index being then noted, the Wheel was 
turned again 'till the Interferon of the Wires in the Focus was brought to touch the Star at 
the inftant of it's Tranfit. Then by the Number of the Revolutions of the Wheel and it's 
parts that had parted by the fixed Index, the angular Motion of the Axis of the Telefcope 
was eafily found by a Table of Minutes and Seconds, anfwering to thofe Revolutions ; then 
the Differences of thofe Angles found at different Obfervations, are the Differences of the Star's 
Declinations. 

Dr Hook's Inftrument, which he fixed up at Grejham College, defcribed by himfelf, was 
much fuch another, with a Telefcope of 36 Feet long. 

Dr Bradley's Inftrument, as he himfelf fays in the Philofophical Tranfaclicns, Numb. 406. 
was erected at Wanftead in EJfcx, in the Year 1727. It's Telefcope was but 124 Feet long. 
That it was upon the fame Principles, and for the fame Purpofe, as thofe of Dr Hook and 
Mr Molyneux ; that it's Structure was contrived, and chiefly directed by Mr Graham. That 
Mr Molyneux 's Inftrument being originally defigned to try, whether the bright Star in the 
Head of the Dragon had any fenfible Parallax, could not be altered, as to it's Direction, 
more than feven or eight Minutes, and fo could not well be ufed to make trial with other 
Stars. That his own Inftrument had a divided Arch of 12 i Degrees, reaching to 6 ^ ° on 
each fide the Zenith. And that he could be fecure of it's Situation to half a Second, viz. 
he could take by it a Zenith Diftance of a Star to half a Second. Which I think to be fcarcely 
poflible in the actual Practice, however it may be made out by Theory. For an Arch of half 
a Second to a Radius of 12 ' Feet will be but about the 2600th part of an Inch, which I 
take to be too fmall an Interval to be diftinguifhed by the Sight, efpecially when it is liable to 
be difturbed by Refraction, (even in the Zenith, as it has been alTerted) as well as other Im- 
pediments. Be this as it will, Dr Bradley could not find any annual Parallax of the fixed 
Stars. Nor could Mr Molyneux with his Inftrument, although Dr Hook fays he did with his. 
Dr Bradley fufpects the Accuracy of Dr Hook's Inftrument, as well as the Truth of the 
Conclufions deduced from the Obfervations made with it; that is, that the fixed Stars have 
really no annual Parallax, though Dr Hook, by his Obfervations makes it out, that they have 
one of about 27 or 30". See Dr Hook's Treatife, called, An Attempt to prove the Motion of the 
Earth. So alio Mr Flam/lead will have it, that the Diftances of the Pole Star from the Ze- 
nith varies, as he found by Obfervations made for feven Years with a Mural Quadrant of al- 
moft feven Feet Radius. His Letter to Dr Wallis, Anno 1698. Bee. 20. is to be feen at 
page 701. of the Third Volume of Dr Wallis's Mathematical Works. 

VIII. Artificial Magnets. 

This is a Name given to pieces of Steel, which being properly touched with Loadftones, 
do thereby acquire the fame Magnetical Qualities which thofe Loadftones have themfelves ; 
that is, will have attractive and directive Powers; fome in a greater, and fome in a lefs De- 
gree, according to the fize, bignefs, fort, hardnefs or foftnefs, of the Steel, and manner of 
preparing and touching it. The way of making thefe artificial Magnets is not new, feveral 
did it in fome Degree many Years ago. But fome of the beft that have been made of late 

Years 



304 A floort Account of fame Inftruments, &amp;c. 

Years are thofe of Servington Savery, Efq; who, in the Philofophical Tranfaclions, Numb. 
414. for the Year 1730. gives a very honeft, elegant, and plain Account of them, and how 
to make them. Afterwards, in the Year 1744. the very ingenious Dr Knight (fee the Pki- 
lojopbical TranfaiJions, Numb. 474.) produced feveral artificial Magnets of his own Contri- 
vance before the Royal Society, lome of which confided of plain Bars of Steel naked, and 
others of Bars or Blocks of the fame Subftance, armed with Iron, after the common Man- 
ner of natural Loadftones, with much greater lifting Powers than thofe of Mr. Savery. But 
I do not find the Doclor has any where difcovered his way of making them, which it is 
pity he did not, in order for one to fee whether his was only an Improvement of Mr Sa- 
very's, or fome other of the Dodor's own, not thought of by Mr Savery, or others before. 
However, in the Year 1751. there was printed at Cambridge a fmall Tract by J. Mitchell, 
B. A. fhewing how to make artificial Magnets in an ealy and expeditious Manner, and 
which (as the Author himfelf fays) are fuperior to the beft natural Magnets, &amp;c. Now I 
mail only take Notice here of two Things he fays in this Treatife. He tells us at page 19. 
that the Attraction and Repulfion of Magnets decreafe as the Squares of the Diftances of ths 
refpective Poles increafe, but gives no Proof of it by undoubted Experiments of his own, 
or thofe of any body elfe. Sir Ifaac Newton, Dr Brook Taylor, and Dr Mufchenbroeck, all 
differ from him about this Matter. Sir Ifaac fays, in the 5th Corollary to the 6th Propor- 
tion of the 3d Book of his Mathematical Principles of Natural Philofophy, that vis magne- 
tica in receffu a magnete decrefcit in ratione diflantia non duplicata, fed fere triplicata, 
quantum ex craffis quibufdam obfervationibus animadvertere potui -, that is, the magnetical 
Attraction, as you go from the Magnet decreafes, not in the duplicate Ratio of the Di- 
ftance, but nearly in the triplicate Ratio, as far as I was able to gather from fome grofs Ex- 
periments. Dr Brook Taylor (in the Philofophical Tranfaclions, Numb. 368.) fays from Ex- 
periments, which he made, it appears that the Power of Magnetifm does not alter according 
to any particular Power ot the Diftances, but decreafes much falter in the greater Distances 
than it does in the near ones. And Dr Mufchenbroeck, at Numb. 390. of the Philofophical 
Tranfaclions, has confirmed by Experiments the fame thing, viz. that there is no Propor- 
tion between the attractive Force of the Magnet and the Diftance. His way of doin^ this 
being, very convincing and ingenious, with two Terrellas or fpherical Magnets, whole Poles 
were in the Extremes of their Axes. He fufpended one of thefe from a Thread over the 
other, at different Diftances from each other, and with Balance put to the end of the 
Thread, he could weigh the Quantity of the Forces wherewith the Terrella's acted upon one 
another at different Diftances, &amp;V. Mr Mitchell fays, at page 74. that mod Brafs, and 
much burned Bricks, &amp;c. are magnetical, but has produced no Proof by Experiments, 
without which, in thefe Matters, no Man can go one Step, or truly affirm or deny any 
Thing. In a Word, I fhall have a better Opinion of thefe artificial Magnets, and be a bet- 
ter Judge of their Goodnefs, when the following Queries are anfwered by Experiments, fuffi- 
cient in Number and Quality. 

1. Whether artificial Magnets in general, have fuch ftrong and lafting lifting, and north- 
pointing Powers, as good natural Magnets, and accordingly whether they are fo proper to 
give the Needles of Sea-Compaffes fo ftrong and lafting directive Powers as natural Magnets ? 

Why I make a Queftion of this may be gathered from the following PaiTages of Mr Sa- 
very's and Dr Knight's Accounts, in thole Tranfactions of the Royal Society, mentioned 
above. Mr Savery fays, he touched 37 large Steel Wires, 2.74 Inches long one by one, 
made a hexagonal Bundle of them, and bound them together with Armour, which then 
would lift a Key weighing 11 25 Grains Troy by the South Pole; but, fays he, when after each 
of thofe Wires had been placed feparately in a magnetical Line for two Days, each of them 
had loft fome Virtue ; and again, that feven round Bars of Steel, all of a Size, ■] of an 
Inch in Diameter, and Length above 12 Inches, being prepared, touched, and armed, the 
fame as thofe Wires, lifted up about half a Year afterwards, more than one Pound ; by 
which it fhould feem that Mr Savery meant they lifted more than one Pound at firft. 

Dr Knight produced, at a Meeting of the Royal Society, a compound artificial Magnet, 
confifting of 12 Steel Bars, which had, in an Experiment before the Prefident, lifted up 
twenty-three Pound 2 \ Ounces Troy, did here, under all the Inconveniences and Difadvan- 
tages of a crowded Room, ftill lift up 21 Pounds and 11 Ounces Troy. That a fingle 
armed Block of Steel, which had before lifted 14 Pounds and two Ounces, did here, under 
the fame Difadvantages, as the former, lift thirteen Pounds and feven Ounces Troy Weight. 
Now I confefs, that I cannot comprehend how a crowded Room fhould gaufe the Magnets 
to lift up lefs Weight than they did at firft ; but rather think they might have loft fome ot 
their Virtue. 

2. Whether thofe artificial Magnets that have the greateft lifting Powers, do always give 
to touched Needles the greateft north-pointing Powers ? 

3. Whether the Conclufions from Experiments drawn from one of the Ways of meafur- 
ing the Strength of the north-pointing Power of a touched Needle, by bringing a Magnet, 
(arc. towards it, 'till the Magnet juft begins to move the Needle from it's fixed Place 
of pointing, be not truer and more to be depended upon than the other way, by- the 

greater

greater or lefs Number of horizontal Vibrations of the Needle, and that of their Times of 
Vibration ? 

From what has been faid, it is evident to me, that artificial Magnets lofe fome of their 
Power in fome lime-, and if they are found in a longer Time to lofe more, they may at 
laft be fo weak, as not to communicate to a Needle a North-pointing Power of fufricient 
Strength ■, that is, would be good for nothing. It might likewife be proper to obferve, whe- 
ther the Virtue of natural Magnets may not decreafe in time, as well as that of artificial Mag- 
nets •, and which do this the leaft, for thefe laft are certainly the beft. 

The natural Magnets of the greateft attractive Powers, that I ever heard of, are three 
One is an armed Terrella, belonging to the Royal Society, prefented to them by the Earl of 
jibercom-, which, when his Lordfhip had it, is faid to have lifted 40 Pounds weight. An- 
other of the late Duke of Devon/hire's, fome Years ago, at the Houfe of the Royal Society, 
did at a Meeting of the Society left up near 100 weight, if I remember right. Laftly, I 
have been told, that the King of Portugal has got a Magnet that will lift up 6000 Ounces 
(but what Ounces I do not know), A Son of mine faw a Print and Defcription of it in the 
Hands of a Tradefman at Cork. 

Mr Mufchenbroeck, (fee the Philofophical Tranfailions, Numb. 390.) had a Magnet that 
would act upon a touch'd Needle at the Diftance of 14 Rbinland Feet. 

The beft Philofophers, who have endeavoured to explain the Manner in which the magne- 
tical Virtue of the Loadftone acts, fay, that the magnetick Matter of a Loadftone moves in 
a Stream from one Pole to the other internally, and is then carried back in curve Lines ex- 
ternally, 'till it arrives again at the Pole where it firft entered, to be again admitted. The 
immediate Caufe why two or more magnetical Bodies attract each other, is the Flux of one 
and the fame Stream of magnetical Matter through them ; and the immediate Caufe of mag- 
nttical Repulfion, is the Conflux and Accumulation of the magnetical Matter. This is to- 
lerably well made appear by Des Cartes, in his Treat ife upon the Magnet. See page 270, 
283. Part 4. of his Principles of Pbilofopby ; and better by others after him. 

I fhall now proceed to mention a few Things in general, about the Variation of the mag- 
netical Needle. 

1. It has been found by Obfervations, both at Sea and Land, for near 200 Years lafr^ 
that the touched Needle of a Sea-Compafs does not point exactly to the North or South, 
but in a few Places, which all lie nearly in the fame Meridian. At all other Places, in which 
Experiments have been made, the pointing of the Needle is not North, but to fome other 
Degree of the Horizon, either towards the North-Well, North-Faff, South- Weft, or South- 
Eaft, more or lefs. It has alfo been found, that the Variation of the Needle from the North 
at the fame Place alters, more and more, by a very flow Motion. For Example, Mr Bur- 
roivs, in the Year 1580, at Limeboufe near London, obferved the Variation to be ii° 11' 
eafterly. Mr Gunter, in 1612, 6 ° eafterly. Mr Gellibrand, in 1633. 4 eafterly. In the 
Year 1657. there was no Variation. In 1672. the Variation was 2 30' wefterly. In 1692- 
it was 6 ° wefterly. In 1723. 14°. 17'. And Mr George Graham (in the Philofophical 
'I'ranfaHions, at Numb. 487. for the Year 1748.) concludes, that during the Courfe of 167 
Years, viz. from 1580, to the End of the Year 1747. the magnetical Needle has moved 
weft wards at Lotidon 28 ° $3. 

Flence, if the magnetical Needle at London moved equally towards the Weft, it would go 
wefterly about 1 o'. z" every Year, and perform one Revolution in about 2079 Years. But 
it does not move equally to the Weft, according to thefe Obfervations ; for becaufe in the 
Year 1580. the Variation was E. 1 1 °. 15'. and in the Year 1657. there was no Variation •, in 
77 Years, it moved 1 1'\ 15'. And in the Year 1723. it was obferved to be 14 . iy'. 
wefterly ; and fo had moved in 66 Years (from 1657 to 1723.) 3 . 2'. more than it did be- 
fore in 77 Years •, confequently it's Motion was flower from 1580 to 1657, t ^ ian ^ was 
from 1657 to 1723. 

.Again, in the Philofophical Tranfailions, Numb. 64. Mr Hevelius at Dantzich, obferved 
the Variation of the Needle to be weftward. In the Year 1620, i°. In the Year 1642, 
3°. 5'. In the Year 1670, 7 . 20'. Flence, according to him, the Variation in 50 Years, 
viz. from 1620 to 1670. was 6°. 20 / . wherefore, if the Motion were equable, a compleat 
Revolution by Mr Ilevelius's Obfervations, would be performed in about 2857 Years. He 
makes the Variation at Dantzick to increafe every Year 9'. 6". But how true this is I know 
not; it can only be found by FLxperience, whether it be fo or not-, and if it be true, the 
Variation at any given Time, paft or to come, might eafily be known without Obfer- 
vation. 

2. The Variation of the Needle in the high Latitudes has generally been found to be much 
greater than in other Places, as in Hudfon's Streights, from 6S Degrees of Longitude to 8r 
Degrees, and Latitude 64 . The Variation was obferved by Captain Middleton (fee Numb. 
393. of the Philofophical T'ranfcMions) to be 46° •, and in Baffin's Bay, in the Latitude of 
80^'. the Variation (fee a Table in the Philofophical Tranfailions, Numb. 148.) was obferved 
to be 57 . wefterly in the Year 1668. Capt. Middleton fays, the Compafs in Hudfon\ 
Streights, would fcarcely traverfe at all. He fays alfo (at Numb. 449. of the faid Tranf- 
actions for the Year 1735.) when he was in the Ice in Hudfon's Bay, the Needle of his Com- 

4 K paft 



306 A Jhort Account of fome Inflrumenis^ &amp;c. 

pafs would oftentimes lofe fo much of it's magnetick Virtue, as that ic would not traverfe 
at all, any longer than the Quarter-Matter kept touching it, but by bringing the Compafs 
to the Fire he recovered it'svirtue. The accurate Mr Jofepb Harris (fee the Pbilofophial 
Tranf&gt;Mions, Numb. 428. for the Year 1733.) fays, that being at Sea about Jamaica, and 
the Havamiah, in the Year 1733. he thought the Virtue of the Needle of the Compafs was 
not always of equal Strength. Sometimes feveral Obfervations would agree very well, ac 
other Times the Card would ftand indifferently any where, within a Degree or more of it's 
Meridian; and he obferved this feveral Times. He alfo .fays, the Card would differ from 
itfelf about 2°. fometimes between the Morning and the Evening of the fame Day •, and this 
Difference would continue regular, as it were, for feveral Days, and then vanifh for a Week 
and more, and then would return as before. This ingenious Perfon alfo fays (fee Numb. 
401. of the Philofophical Tranfaftions) that in his Voyage from England to Vera Cruz they 
obferved the Variation with a good Azimuth Compafs ; but he always found the beft Obfer- 
vations they could make, when compared together, differed fo much, that they could not 
be depended upon, to much lefs than three or four Degrees, and fometimes to half a Point 
of the Compafs. Moreover, the ingenious Mr George Graham (fee the Philofophical Tranf- 
aRions, Numb. 383.) from Obfervations he made at London, of the Variation of the mag- 
netick Needle, found that three touched Needles would exactly fettle and point to the fame 
Place, after being removed, by a great Number of Trials made immediately one after 
another, but yet he found them at different Times of removal to differ confiderably from 
their former Directions. After many Trials he found all the Needles he uled would not 
only vary in their Directions upon different Days, but frequently upon different Times of the 
fame Day ; and this Difference would fometimes amount to more than half a Degree in the 
fame Day, fometimes in a few Hours. He alfo found the Variation has generally been 
greateft for the fame Day, between the Hours of twelve and four in the Afternoon, and the 
lead about fix or feven in the Evening, &amp;c. This ingenious Perfon alfo, in the Philofcphi- 
ealTranfatlions, Numb. 389. for the Year 1723. gives an Account of a Dipping Needle of 
his, with Obfervations to try if the Dip and Vibrations were conftant and regular. 

AH thefe Inequalities and Irregularities of the Variation of the magnetick Needle (and 
many others to be found in Authors) may in part be true, and proceed from true Caufes 
afTigned, and partly be not fo, but let down as true from fallable, uncertain, erroneous Ob- 
fervations of thofe that made them, which might proceed, 1. From the Nearnefs of Iron. 
2. The Weaknefs of the magnetick Virtue of the Needle difpofing it to (land indifferently 
at any Point of the Compafs it is fet to. 3. The Friction of the Cap. 4. The Motion of 
the Ship. 5. The Refiftance of the Air, which in high Latitudes may be fo great in the 
cold Weather, as to confiderably affect the true pointing of the Needle. 6. The great Re- 
fraction, in high Latitudes, caufing an Error in finding the Meridian Line, which Line, in 
high Latitudes, cannot be determined with any great Certainty, by any Method whatfoever, 
in my Opinion •, becaufe in thefe Latitudes all the Points of the Compafs begin almoft to be 
nearly Meridians, (for at the Pole itfelf, every Point of the Florizon is South at the North 
Pole, and North at the South Pole,) and becaufe the Amplitudes and Azimuths of the Sun 
or Stars, cannot be taken in thofe high Latitudes, without Error, if at all, by reafon of 
the too great obliquity of the Arches of the diurnal Motion in thofe Latitudes •, and fince the 
meridian Lines cannot be found, but by an Amplitude or Azimuth obferved, it is evident the 
Variation cannot be had to any great Exactnefs, if at all, in fuch high Latitudes. 

Mr Wright, in his Treatife of the Errors of Navigation, firffc publifhed before the Year 
1600, gives a Table of the Variation of the Compafs, as taken by himfelf, both at Sea and 
at Shore, in a Voyage of the Right Honourable the Earl of Cumberland, in the Year 1598. 
He alfo gives two other Tables of the Variation at the End of that Book, the one pretty long 
and extenfive, with regard to the principal Places of the Earth or Sea ; and the other a leffer 
Table, of Peter Plancius's. Dr Halley (in the Philofophical Tranfatlions, Numb. 148. for 
the Year 1683.) gives another Table of the Variation in different Places, at different Times. 
But, in my Opinion, this Table is much too fhort and imperfect for a Foundation to build a 
true Theory of the Variation upon, though the Doctor himfelf did take it to be fufiicient in 
that Tranfaction, where he fuppofes the whole Globe of the Earth to be one great Magnet with 
four fixed magnetical Poles, near each Pole of the Equator two, and that in thofe Parts ol 
the World which lie near adjacent to any of thofe magnetick Poles, the neareft Pole being al • 
•ways predominant over the more remote, &amp;c. Upon this Suppofition the Doctor ingeniouily 
enough accounts in general for the Variations and Alterations, when they are always the fame 
at the fame Place ; but fince thev have been obferved to be different at the fame Place. The 
Doctor had laid afide, for fome Years, this Theory of his of four fixed magnetical Poles, and 
(in the Philofophical Tranfatlions, Numb. 195.) re fumed it again with Alterations and 
Amendments, making two of the magnetical Poles moveable, &amp;c. and conjectures, that thcle 
two moveable Poles perform one Revolution in about 700 Years, at the end or which Time 
all the Variations will be the fame again in the fame Places, C5V. Mr Bond, in his Treatife of 
the Longitude found, pag. 7. fays this Revolution will be once in 600 Years, arid that the 
Earth has but two magnetick Poles, at 80 {- ° Diftance from the Poles of the Equator, fcJV. 
The Frenchmen who, in the Year 1737, went to meafure a Degree of the Earth, at Tornca, in 

the 



A fhort Account of fome Inftruments, &amp;c. 307 

the Latitude 6f. 50'. found the Variation to be thefc f. 5'. weftwardly. And in the Year 




pofitions'to "account for the Caufes of the Variation, can reconcile thefe feveral" Differences 
of the Times of the Revolutions of the Variation that I haVe given above, and therefore 
their Hypothecs cannot be true. 

In fhort, this Affair of the Variation is Very uncertain,- it s true Cauie not rightly known •, 
nor have we any true and fixed Rules how to compute what it is or will be at a given 
Place,' at a given Time. Tables of the true Quantity thereof for feveral Years, at many 
different Places, under the fame Meridians and Parallels, being wanted to build a true Sy- 
ftem upon. From fuch Tables only it can be gathered how the Variation at given Places 
alters, and at what Rate, and according to what Regularity, and whether any of thefe Things 
can be difcerned or not. , 

Dr Hallefs, Chart of the Variation is very ingenious, but how true it is I cannot lay. It 
true for the Time he made it, it cannot be fo in future, becaufe of the Alteration of the Va- 
riation at a given Place. 

There are feveral Authors, our own Countrymen, who have wrote upon the attractive 
Virtue of the Magnet. As Gilbert de Magnet e, Robert Norman, and Mr Burroughs** new 
Attractive, wherein is an Account of the Variation. The Lord Paiflefs Treatife about the 
attractive Virtue of the Loadftone, with Calculations and Tables, &amp;c. And Mr Mufchen- 
broeck's Dijjcrtatio de Magnetc. This laft by an ingenious Dutchman, who has wrote well 
upon the Subject. 

IX. A New contrived Mariner's Compafs. 

ThisTnftrument is defcribed in the Pbilofophical TranfaElions, Numb. 495. it differs from the 
others that are commonly made, in having it's Needle in fhapeofaParallalepipedon. It's Card, 
confiftincr of unftiffencd Pa-er, and a light thin Circle of Brafs, divided into Degrees, &amp;c. 
An ivory Cap, turned fo as to receive a fmall bit of Agate at the Top. The Point fupport- 
in» the Card is a common fewing Needle. The very ingenious Dr Knight, who exhibited 
oiie of thefe Compaffes before the Royal Society in the Year 1750. made by Mr Smealon, will 
have thefe Alterations to be for the better, both tor the true and well pointing of the Needle, 
and it's long Continuance to do fo. But although the great Number of Experiments the 
Doctor has tryed and made, many of which arc to be feen in the Pbilofophical Tranfaftions, at 
Numb. 474, in the Year 1744. is a plain Proof of his Skill in Magnetifm ; yet I am not 
quite fatisfied with what he fays of the Faults in the Compafs Cards, and his Remedies. 
His Experiments about this to me feem to be too few, to deduce from them a general Re- 
jection of the Make and Fafhion of the old Cards, as being lefs perfect than thofe he re- 
commends. Skilful Mariners (of which we have enough) who have ufed Compaffes at Sea 
for many Years, may at leafl be allowed to be as competent Judges of the Goodnefs of their 
Compaffes, as the Doctor; and I have always been apt to think, that real Improvements of 
Inftruments that have been generally ufed for more than two Flundred Yeajs, .would have 
been thought of before the Year 1750. The Plants and Trees of the Gardens, of the Arts 
and Sciences, cultivated by the Dung of Ambition, and nouriflied with the Waters of Inte- 
reft, are very fubject to be blafted by the Winds of Error, and fometimes Hunted by the 
Weeds of Impofition. 

X. The Ufe of an Azimuth Compafs, of a new Contrivance, by Capt. Middleton, is to be found 
in the Philofophical Tranfactions, Numb. 450. for the Tear 1738. 

The Captain fays, that the Variation of the magnetical Needle at Sea may be found by it, 
with greater F&gt;fe and Exactnefs, than by any other Azimuth-Compafs contrived before that 
Time, viz. the Year 1738. But as he conceals the Defcription of his Inftrument, we don't 
well know how to judge of it's Excellency, he telling us, that thofe who have the Inftru- 
ment before them, have no Occafion for a Defcription of it. That he himfelf found by Expe- 
rience it was effectual. He only fhews the Manner of ufing it; fays that one Perfon may 
manage it, whereas the old Compafs requires feveral Perfons, which alfo makes it fubject to 
many great Errors, as he will have it. 

The Main of this new contrived Compafs of the Captain's, gathered from the fhort Ac- 
count he gives of it's Ufe, is the taking the Sun's Altitude by Reflection, viz. bringing it 
down to the Horizon, in fome fuch Manner as is done by Mr Hadky's Sea-Quadrant. It 
carries a Telefcope with a vertical Hair within it. It is very pofiible this is a very good Com- 
pafs, but it's dearnefs may be fome Objection to it's general Ufe. 

XI. Cekflial Globes fomeivhat improved. 

The late ingenious Mr Scnex, at Numb. 447. of the Philofophical TranfaHions for the Year 
j 730. fhews how to make the Poles of the Diurnal Motion in a Celeftial Globe pafs round 
the Poles of the Ecliptic. His Contrivance is this; the Poles of the diurnal Motion do not 

enter 



308 A Jhort Account of fome Inftruments^ &amp;c. 

enter into the Globe, but are affixed at one End to two Shoulders or Arms of" Brafs, at the 
Diftance of 23 I Degrees from the Poles of the Ecliptick. Thefe Shoulders at the other 
end are ftrongly fattened on to an iron Axis, parting through the Poles of the Ecliptick, and 
is made to move round, but with a very ft iff Motion •, fo that when it is adj tilted to any 
Point of the Ecliptick which you defire the Equator may interfect, the diurnal Motion of the 
Globe about it's Axis will not be able to difturb it. 

The Reafon of Fuch a Contrivance is to render the Ufe of the celeftial Globes more perfect 
and lading, than they can be without it ; becaufe the Places of the fixed Stars, put down upon 
celeftial Globes, made at any given Time, will not be true but for fome Years, by reafon 
of the Proceffion of the equinoctial Points, viz. the Interferon of the Planes of the Eclip- 
tick and Equator, caufing the Diftances of the fixed Stars from thofe Points continually to 
alter ; this was obferved by the antient Aftronomers, who made the Sphere of the fixed 
Stars to move about the Poles of the Ecliptick with a flow Motion, fo that all the fixed 
Stars in the Ecliptick or its Parallels, will go once round in the Space of 25920 Years, alter 
which Time the Stars will again return to their former Places. 

Hence the Longitude of the fixed Stars alter one Degree at the End of every 72 Years or 
50" every Year. Therefore celeftial Globes made many Years ago, or ftich as' are 'new 
made, many Years hence, cannot be ufed with Certainty, the Places of the Stars fet down 
upon them altering too much, at the Ends of thofe Times, and to remedy this in fome 
meafure is what Mr Senex propofes to Oo, by his Contrivance abovementioned. 

Note, There is another Way to do the fame Thing by Dr Latham, at Numb. 460. of the 
Philofophical Tranfattions, for the Year 1741. 

The very ingenious Mr James Fergufoti, (at Numb. 483. in the Year 1747. of the Philo- 
fophical Tranfatlions,) has added another Improvement to the celeftial Globe, chiefly for find- 
ing the Times of the Rifing and Setting of the Moon, with her Time of coming to the 
South, tolerably exact, without an Ephemeris ; but nearer the Truth, by having «iven the 
Moon's Latitude for the Day by an Ephemeris, 

His Contrivance is as follows : On the Axis of the Globe above the Hour circle is fixed 
Plate 4. the Arch A at one End by the Screw D (fee Fig. 24.) fo as to leave fufficient Room for 
Fig. 24. turning the Hour Index. The other End at B, being always over the Pole of the Ecliptick 

has a Pin fixed into it, whereon the Collets C and B, are moveable by their Wires F and G 
when the Screw E is flackened, and may be made fait at 1'leafure by this Screw; lb that the 
turning the Globe round will carry the Wires round with it, fhewing thereby the apparent 
Motions of the Sun and Moon by the little Balls on their Ends at PI and I. On the Collet C, 
in which the Sun's Wire is fixed, there is alfo fixed the circular Plate L, whereon the 29 4. 
Days of the Moon's Age are engraven, which have their beginning juft below the Sun's 
Wire, confequently the Plate L cannot be turned without carrying the Sun's Wire'aloncr 
with it, by which means the Moon's Age is always counted from the Sun ; and the Moon's 
Wire being turned fo as to be under the Day of her Age on this Plate, will fet her at her 
due Diftance from the Sun at that Time. Thefe Wires being Quadrants from C to H, and 
from B to I, mult ftill keep the Sun and Moon directly over the Ecliptick, becaufe the 
Centre of their Motions at C and B is directly over the Pole of the Ecliptick, in the artick 
Circle. But becaufe the Moon does not keep her Courfe in the Ecliptick, as the Sun does, 
having a Declination of 5 i Degrees on each fide of it in every Lunation, fhe is made to 
fcrew on her Wire as far on both fides, as this her Declination or Latitude amounts to ; for 
this purpofe K is a fmall Piece of Palte-board to be applied over the Ecliptick at right Angles, 
the middle Line 00 ftanding perpendicularly thereon; from this Line there is maked 5 a 
Degrees on each fide upon the outward Limb, which reaching to the Moon makes her to be 
eafily afljufted to her Latitude at any Time. Note, The Horizon of the Globe fhould be 
fupported by two femicircular Arches, inftead of the ufual Way of doing it by Pillars, be- 
caufe the Arches will not ftop the Progrefs of the Balls, when they go below the Horizon in 
an oblique Sphere. 

The USE. 
To retlify the Globe. Elevate the Pole to the Latitude of the Place, then bring the Sun's 
Place in the Ecliptick to the brazen Meridian, and fet the Hour Index to XII at Noon. Keep- 
ing the Globe in this Pofition, flacken the Screw E, and fet the Sun directly over his Place in 
the Meridian ; which done, kt the Moon's Wire under the Day of her Age, for that Time, on 
the Plate D, and fhe will ftand over her Place in the Ecliptick, for that Time, and you will fee 
in what Conftellation fhe then is. Laftly, fallen the Wires by the Screw E, and the Globe will 
be rectified ; this done, turn it round in the ufual Way, and you will fee the Sun and Moon 
rife and fet for that Day, on the fame Point of the Horizon, as they do in the Heavens ; the 
Times of their rifing and letting are fhewn by the Hour Index, which alfo fhews the Time of 
the Moon's paffing over the Meridian. If you want to find the Times of the rifing and fetting 
of the Moon to greater Exactnefs, find her Latitude for that Day by the Ephemeris ; and as it 
is South or North, fcrew her fo many Degrees from the Ecliptick, meafuring them by the Pafte- 
board K, applying it to the Ecliptick, as abovementioned ; and then turning the Globe round, you 
will fee the Time of the Moon's rifing and fetting by the Hour Index, and her Amplitude on the 

Horizon 



A jhort Account of fome Inflruments, Sec. 309 

Honzon for that Time, as it is affected by her Latitude, which will fometimes be very confi- 
derable. Note, All the Phenomena of the Harveft-Moon become very plain by this addi- 
tional Contrivance, which is curious enough. But fome People may think the common way 
of finding the Time of the Moon's coming to the South, (given in what is cafled the Julian 
Calendar, to be found in fome Books of Navigation) which is eafy and well known, and 
may be exact enough for many Purpofes, may be fufficient, without fuch an additional Con- 
trivance as this, to do the fame Thing. 

XII. Clocks, and other Time-Keepers. 
The Inftruments for meafuring Time, are Sun-Dials, Water Dials, Sand-Dials, a fingle 
Pendulum, or Clocks and Watches. Sun-Dials have been enough treated of by Mr Bion. 
Water-Dials and Sand-Dials are now in no very great Efteem, although fome of them are 
ingenious enough ; they are treated of in feveral Writings, viz. in Vitruyius's Architecture^ 
Gefner*s Pandetlicks, Mariinelli of Elementary Clocks, Archangelo Maria Radi. of Sand- 
Dials, Schottus in his Tecbnica Curio/a, &amp;c. 

The old indented Wheel-Clocks that were regulated by horizontal Balances., and generally 
ufed 'till the Year 1660, are now in no great Ufe, being far more imperfect than thofe which 
have Pendulums adapted to them to regulate their Motion ; nor do Watches meafure Time 
fo equable and true as Pendulum-Clocks. Galileo's Son was the firft who applied a Pendu- 
lum to a Clock in the Year 1649. And tne g rcat Mr Huygens, in the Year 1673, pubhfhed 
his famous Book, called Horclogium Ofcillatorium, explaining the Manner of doing it with a 
Figure of the Clock, being indeed the very fame as that Clock deferred by Mr Bion. 

There are feveral more Things about Clocks, treated of by Mr Huygens, in his Book 
abovementioned, the chief of which are what follow. 

Mr Hrngens, at page 13. of his Horologium, gives two Ways to regulate the Motion of a 
Clock. The firft is by the Obfcrvations of the Tranfits or Paffagcs of fome of the known 
fixed Stars, and the other by means of the Times given by the. Shadow of the Sun upon a 
Dial, together with an Equation Table. 

The Subftance of what he fays is this, choofe fome proper Place for the Eye, from which 
you may fee feveral ot the fixed Stars inftantly difappear in paffing behind high Luildings, 
and in that Place fix a Plate with a Hole in it to look through, of the Magnitude of the 
Pupil of the Ey", in order to bring it always to the fame Point •, this done, obferve the 
Time fhewn by the Clock the Moment you fee a known fixed Star vanifhing from, your 
Sight behind the Building, the Eye looking through that fixed Hole, and doing the fame 
Thing the next Night, or rather fome Nights after, if the Interval of Time between two 
fuch Obiervations of the fame Star be only one Day, and the Time given by the Clock in 
the later Obfervation be lefs than that given in the former, by three Minutes and 56 Seconds, 
then it is evident the Clock goes right, becaufe every Revolution of the fixed Stars is lefs 
than a mean folar Day by that Quantity. I fay a mean folar Day, becaufe folar Days, or 
the Intervals of the Sun's Appultes to the Meridian are unequal. But if the fame Obfcrva- 
tions be repeated fome Nights after, the Computation of that Difference muft be made at 
each. For Example, fuppofe at the fiifl Oblervation a Star vanifhes at g h 30' 18" by the 
Clock, and leven Days after the fame Star appears to vanifh by the Clock at 8\ 50''. 24/''. 
the Difference of thefe Time is 39'. 54''. and a feventh Part of it is 5'. 42'' which fhews, that 
the diurnal Period or the Clock is 5 54". longer than a fidereal Day, whereas a folar Day of 
a mean Length is but 3 . 6 ' . longer, and by Confequence the diurnal Period of the Clock is 
i'. 46". too long. Note, The Intervals of Time between the fucceffive Appulfes of a fixed 
Star to the fame vertica Circle, are equal to the Intervals bttween it's Appulfes to the Meri- 
dian. But to avoid the Uncertainty ot the Air's Refraction, as much as may be, the Face of 
the Building fhould be as near the Plane of the Meridian as poffible. Note alfo, The Stars 
made Choice of fhould be thofe near the Equinoctial, by reafon of their quick Paffages. 

The Motion of a Clock may be examined another way by the Sun. But we muft here 
have regard to the Inequality of the Natural Days ; for as has been faid, thefe are not all 
equal between themfeives, and though the Difference be but fmall, yet it often happens, that 
in the Space of feveral Days it becomes fo confiderable, as it muft not be difregarded ; for 
although we fhould have the moft perfect Defcription of the folar Days, and the Motion of 
the Clock moft exactly agreed with the true Meafure of thofe Days; yet it would neceffarily 
happen that at certain Times of the Year they would differ from one another a 'Quarter of an 
Hour, or even Half an Hour, and then again at ftated Times return to their Agreement ; 
as is to be feen in the Tables of the Equation of Days. 

Now, to compare the Motion of a Clock by that of the Sun on a Sun-Dial, take the 
Equation of any Day, when the Clock is fet to go with the Sun-Dial, and the Equation of 
that Day, you want to know how true the Clock goes. If the former Equation be greater 
than the latter, the Time by the Clock will exceed that of the Sun-Dial, by the Difference 
of thofe Equations •, but if the Equation of the; latter Day be found to be greater, the 
Time by the Sun Dial will be the greatcft. For Example, If on the Fifth of March the Clock 
and Sun going together, the Equation of that Day be found in the Table to be 3'. n". and 
I want to know, whether or not, on the 20th Day of the fame Month, the Clock truly mea~ 

4 L fares 



310 A fhort Account of fome Injlruments^ &amp;c. 

fures equai Time, the Equation for this Day in the Table will be 7'. 27". which becaufe it is 
greater than that for the 5th, by 4 . 16 '. the Time fhewn by the Sun-Dial will be flower than 
that given by the Clock by the faid Difference; wherefore if it be found different, it is eafy 
to gather from thence how much every Day the Sun Dial goes faftcr or flower than the 
Clock. 

Note, The Conftruction of an Equation Table of this Kind, is founded upon a twofold 
Caufe, both known to Aftronomers, viz. upon the Obliquity ol the Ecliptick, and the Irre- 
gularity of the Sun's Motion, becaufe it is deduced as well by Reafon as Experiments found- 
ed upon thefe very Clocks, without which it could not be inferred ; for Obfervations of the 
Time of the Sun's coming to the Meridian every Day for many Months have moft evidently 
been found to agree. 

Now, if upon Trial by both Methods, but rather by the firft, the daily Error of the Clocks 
going fhould be fo great as to amount to 3'. or 4'. this muft be remedied by lengthening or 
ihortening it's Pendulum, in doing of which the following Rule fhould be obferved, viz. 
the daily Motion of the Clock will be accelerated or retarded by fo many Minutes, as the Pen- 
dulum is fliortened or lengthened about T 4o Parts of an Inch taken fo many times, as there 
are Minutes. The going of the Clock being thus almofl corrected, the reft of the Correction 
is performed by moving upwards or downwards upon the Rod V V a fmall Weight D, as I 
have faid before. (See the Figure in the 17th Plate of the Book of Mathematical Injiru- 
merits.) 

Mr Huygens fays, that two fuch Clocks as thefe were carried to Sea in the Year 1 664, i n 
order to find the Longitude by them, being moved by a Spring inftead of a Weight -, and 
to avoid their being affected by the Motion of the Ship, the Clocks inclofed in a brafs 
Cylinder, were fufpended from a fteel Ball, and the Stern, which continued the Motion of the 
Pendulum, (which Pendulum was half a Foot long) produced downwards, and governed it, 
was in Shape of the Letter F inverted •, for fear leaft the Motion of the Pendulum fhould be- 
come circular, and thereby the Ceflation of it's Motion might arife. The Captain of the 
Ship that had thefe two Clocks being in Company at Sea with three others, on the Coaft of 
Guinea, and failing from thence near the Equinoctial, had a Confukation with the other Cap- 
tains to know where they were, they produced their Journals, the Captain with the Clocks ufing 
them to correct his Journal, by comparing their going with the Motion of the Sun. The 
Event was, that they all differed very much in their Reckoning from this Captain's, viz. one 
faid he was 80 Leagues, another 100, and another ftill more, from the Land, but this Cap- 
tain faid he was but about 30 Leagues, which was found to be true, and the next Day they 
arrived at one of the African Iflands, called Del Fuego. 

Mr Huygens, at page 17. of his Horologium Ofcil. gives a more particular Account of this, 
as well as other Obfervations of other People finding the Longitude at Sea by other of thefe 
Clocks, whofe Pendulums were half a Pound weight, and about nine Inches long, the Mo- 
tion of whofe Wheels was by a Weight, the whole Clock being put into a Cafe four Foot 
long, and at the Bottom of the Cafe there was hung an additional Weight of more than 100 
Pounds, thereby to keep the Inflrument better fufpended in the perpendicular Pofture. 

This great Man Mr Huygens, in his Horologium Ofcil. gives two other Contrivances for the 
equable going of his Clock, and for the Prefervation of it's Motion at Sea, in blowing Wea- 
ther, both ot which, not being long, are as follow : To the Crown Wheel, in which the Pal- 
lets of the Pendulum play, is hung a fmall Weight from a (lender Chain, by which it is only 
moved, all the reft of the Machinery acting no otherwife than that in every half Second, this 
little leaden Weight will be reftored to it's firft Altitude, almoft after the fame Manner as is 
to be fecn in the Conftruction of our Clock already given •, where one Weight is raifed up by 
the Line, while the other {viz. that of the Pendulum) by it's Gravity preferves the Motion 
of the Clock. Now by this Contrivance, every Thing being reduced, as it were, to one 
Wheel only, the Clock will appear to have a greater Equality in it's Motion than it had be- 
fore, viz according to the former Conftruction. And fomething happened here very remark- 
able. When two fuch Clocks were fufpended from the fame Beam, fupported upon two 
Props, the Motion of the Pendulum of each agreed fo well by reciprocal Beats, as not in 
the leaft to vary, the Noife of each being always heard at the fame Moment. And if by fome 
means this Harmony was difturbed, it would be reftored again of itfelf in a fhort time ; I 
at firft wondered at this uncommon Event, but afterwards, upon ftrict Enquiry, I found the 
Caufe thereof to exift in the Motion of the Beam itfelf, although this was fcarcely fenfible. 
For the alternate Vibrations of the Pendulums, by any the leaft Weight communicate fome 
Motion to the Clocks, and this Motion is impreffed upon the Beam itfelf, and by that means 
if each Pendulum did not moft exquifitely move with reciprocal Vibrations, it would at length 
happen, that the Motion of the Beam would altogether ceafe, which Caufe neverthelefs will 
not take place but when the Motion of the Clocks from thence are moft equable, and confen- 
tancous between themfelves. 

The other Contrivance of Mr Huygens's, to preferve the Motion of the Clock at Sea in 

Plate 2. great Agitations of the Ship, is as follows. (See Plate 2. Fig. 22.) The Pendulum is of a 

Fig. 22. triangular Form as A B C, at the Bottom of which the leaden Weight B is hung, and at the 

AnglesAandCofit the fame is alfo fufpended from the cycloidal Plates or Cheeks ED, FG. The

middle of the Bafe A C receives the perpendicular Axis H K of the horizontal Crown Wheel 
N, which turns at K by means of the Teeth of that Wheel, during which Time the Weight 
B moves the Bafe A C of the triangular Pendulum A C B. The Motion of all the Wheels, is 
not by a Weight, but by a fteel Spring enclofed in a Barrel, and the Crown Wheel is below 
the other Wheels of the Clock. L L are the fmall lenticular Weights to regulate the Motion of 
the Pendulum. 

The Manner of the Clock's Sufpenfion is expreffed in the 23d Figure, Plate 2. where the 
Cafe AB is fet upon two Axes, (one of which, as C, can only be feen) fitted to an iron 
Rectangle D E, which Rectangle likewife moves about the Axes F G, going into the Ends 
F G of the iron Gnomon F H K G, which Gnomon is firmly fixed to the Top of that part 
of the Ship wherein fhe Clock is, and to the Bottom of the Cafe is hung a Weight of fifty 
Pounds. By this Contrivance the Clock will preferve it's upright Pofture in all Inclinations 
of the Ship. The Axis C, together with that oppofite to it, is fo placed, as to be in a right 
Line with the two Points of Sufpenfion of the Pendulum, that we have already fpoken off, 
by which means it's ofcillatory Motion cannot move the Clock, than which there is nothing 
more liable to deftroy the Motion of the Pendulum. Moreover, the Thicknefs of the Axes 
C C, of about an Inch, and the Bignefs of the Gravity of the Weight hung on at the Bot- 
tom, are a Check upon the too great Motion of the Clock, and make it continually return 
to it's upright Pofture, when the Ship mould happen to be in a great deal of Agitation. 

Now one of thefe Clocks, thus managed, being tried at Sea, feems more promifing than 
the others that have been already tried, to avoid being affected with the different Motions of 
a Ship. Thus far from Mr Huygens, 

One Mr Harrifon, feveral Years ago, made a Clock to go at Sea of a different Conftruc- 
tion from thofe of Mr Huygens's, whofe Pendulum confifted of feveral horizontal Rods that 
fee-fawed, or vibrated up and down. The Rods were partly of Wood, and partly of Brafs, 
in order to check one another's lengthening or fhortening by heat or cold, and thereby keep- 
ing the Motion of the Clock equable. I have not feen the Clock, and have been only told 
this, by a Perfon who faw it many Years ago. The Inventor himfelf now lives in London. 
One of them was fhewn to the Lords of the Admiralty, and approved of by them. 

That great Mechanick, the late Mr George Graham^ has made fome of the bed Clocks in 
the World for the true meafuring Time ; they are partly defcribed in the PhilofophicalTranf 
cttionsy at Numb. 432. There is alfo another curious Clock of his, defcribed in Dr Defagu- 
liers's, Courfe of Experiments to meafure Time to quarter Seconds. 

Gefner, in his Pandetlicks, fays, that FJrbard JVallingford, an Abbot of St Albans^ who 
lived in the Year 1326, made a Clock with wonderful Art, that had not it's Fellow in all 
the World. Some Clocks have been made to fliew apparent Time, viz. to go with the Sun 
at all Times of the Year. Thefe are Curiofities indeed, but little elfe. Some Clocks fhew 
the Sun's annual Motion by the Addition of a Wheel going once round in 365 Days 5 Hours 
and 49 Minutes ; and others fhew the Moon's fynodical Revolution of 29 Days 12 Hours, 
and 44 Minutes, being the mean Time from one Conjunction to the next. There are other 
Clocks that fhew the Motions of the Planets particularly ; and that Inftrument fhewing the 
Motions and Phafes of them all, of which there are many amongft us, made by our Mathe- 
matical Inftrument-Makers, is called a Planetarium or Orrery. And indeed that defcribed by 
me at page 189, is not fo perfect, as fome that have been made fince, the fuperiors Planets 
not being in it. 

Gafper Scottus the Jefuit, in his Techniea Curiofa, feu Mirabilia Artis, printed in the Year 
1664, in Quarto, fays, that Father Scbirley de Reita&gt; in a Book called, The Eye of Enoch 
and Elias, gives the Conftruction of a Planetarium, reprefenting all the Motions of the Pla- 
nets, both true and mean, their Stations, Retrogradations, and Directions, without Epicycles 
or Equations, and that with a few Wheels, endlefs Screws and Pullies. The flrft Wheel of 
this Inftrument that gives Motion to all the reft, is moved round by the Fall of Water. 
The Sun's Motion in it is only 365 Days, and theDifks of the Planets are too great. See a 
particular Account of all the Parts of this Inftrument in the aforefaid Book of Scottus's ; 
wherein likewife he treats of the different Machines that were in ufe to meafure Time. The 
Book is curious, full of Figures; and although he fometimes fails in the Exactnefs to what 
we are now arrived, yet in my Opinion the Book is valuable enough. 

At the End of Mr Huygens'?, Opufcula pofthuma, printed in Quarto at Leyden, in the Year 
1703, there is a mafterly Defcription of the Motion of the Planets by Clock- Work, at leaft 
upon the Aftronomical Principles affumed by him. He indeed herein makes the annual Mo- 
tion of the Earth to be but 365 Days, when it fliould have been near 6 Hours more, but 
this he did to avoid increafing the Number of Wheels. He gives the beft way of finding 
the Number of Teeth, that will make all the Motions the neareft the Truth poffible, by the 
Method of finding the neareft Ratio in leffer Numbers, that fhall approach to a given Ratio in 
greater Numbers. The Number of the Teeth of one of his Wheels is 300, of another 206, 
of another 219, of another 166, of another 158, of another 137, &amp;c. He gives two very 
large Figures of his Machine, which is 2 Feet over. 

At the End of the firft Volume of Dr Defaguliers's Courfe of Experimental Philofophy, 
printed in the Year 1745, is a Defcription of a Planetariam of the Doctor's, with Figures, 

which

which I take to be one of the beft of thefe Inftrumcnts that has yet appeared, and is 3 Feet 
over. The Dotlor fays, thefe fort of Machines had the Name of Orrery given to them by 
Sir Richard Steele, and the firft that was made in England was by the late Mr George Graham 
about the Year 171 2, which was fent over to Prince Eugene. But that it only fhewed the 
Motion of the Moon round the Earth, and that of the Earth and Moon round the Sun. 
That this Inftrument being in the Hands of Mr Rowley, a Mathematical Inllrument-Maker,' 
he copied it, adding Improvements of his own, and thereby got all the Praife due to Mr 
Graham, though Sir Richard Steele did not know Mr Graham to be the firft Inventor. 

In the Philofophical Tranfatlions, at Numb. 479. for the Year 1746. the ingenious Mr 
Fergufon defenbes the Phanomena of Venus, as reprefented in an Orrery of his, agreeable to 
the Obfervations of S. hianchini, who will have her Axis to be inclined jz°. from a Line 
fuppofed to be drawn perpendicular to the Plane of the Ecliptick, and that her diurnal Mo- 
tion is performed in 24 Days and 8 Hours. Whereas in other Orrerys her Axis is perpen- 
dicular to the Plane of the Ecliptick, and her diurnal Motion about it is only 23 flours. 
This Gentleman's Improvement and Difcoveries are ingenious enough, but it's Ukfulnefs will 
be beft: perceived by the Inhabitants of Venus. 

I ihali here fay no more of thefe very elaborate, expenfive and artificial Clock-Work 
Reprefentations of the Motions, and Appearances of the heavenly Bodies, which at beft are 
only amufive, and apt to afford more Honour to the Inventors, and Intereft to the Makers 
of them, than any ways really promote the moft ufeful Parts of Aftronomy. The next 
Things I fhall mention are fome more concerning the ufeful Inftruments Clocks. 

Mr Huygens's fecond Pendulum Clock, dtferibed by Mr Bion, has five Wheels of 15, 24, 
48, 48, and 80 Teeth, and 2 Pinions of 8 Teeth each. Which are too many. For three 
Wheels of 25, 72, and 80 Teeth, and 2 Pinions of 8 and 10 Teeth, or clfe 3 Wheels of 
25, 64 and 90 Teeth, and thofe 2 Pinions, or 3 Wheels of 30, 60, and 80 Teeth, and 
thofe two Pinions, or three Wheels of 21, y$, and 80 Teeth, and 2 Pinions of 7 and 10 
Teeth, will caufe one Revolution of Wheels, with the greateft Number of Teeth, to be per- 
formed in one Hour, or 3600 Seconds ; and thence to get a Revolution of 12 Hours, two 
Wheels of an equal Number of Teeth, with a Pinion of 6, and another Wheel of 72 Teeth, 
or a Pinion of 7, and a Wheel of 84, or a Pinion of 8, and a Wheel of 96, or a Pinion of 
9, and a Wheel of 108 Teeth, will caufe one Revolution in 12 Hours. Note, The way of 
finding the Number of Teeth of the principal Wheels and Pinions of a Clock is founded up- 
on this Theorem, viz. that the Product of the Teeth of the Pinions multiplied by half the 
Number of Vibrations, is equal to the Product of the Teeth of all the Wheels •, and hence, 
by the Method of finding all the Divifors of a Number, may be obtained all the feveral dif- 
ferent Numbers of Teeth of the Wheels and Pinions that will produce one Revolution in 
the fame given Time. 

The Length of a Pendulum is the Diftance from it's Point of Sufpenfion to it's Centre of 
Ofcillation. A Pendulum, whofe Length is 39.2 Inches will vibrate one of it's fmalleft 
Arches in one Second of Time. The Diftance of the Centre of Ofcillation of a fimple Pen- 
dulum from it's Point of Sufpenfion, may be found by faying, As the Sum of the Weight 
of half the Rod, and the Weight of the Bob, is to the Sum of ~ of the Weight of the 
Rod, and the Weight of the Bob, So is the Diftance from the Point of Sufpenfion, to the 
Centre of Gravity of the Bob, to the Diftance of the Centre of Ofcillation from the Point of 
Sufpenfion. Hence the Centre of Ofcillation lies above the Centre of the Bob. But when the 
Weight of the Rod is exceeding fmall, the Centre of Ofcillation will be fo near the Centre of 
Gravity of the Bob, or its Centre of Magnitude (fuppofing it to confift of uniform Matter of 
the fame Denfity) that all three may be taken for one another, without any fenfible Error. 
Twice the Time of one Vibration of a Pendulum, whofe Centre of Ofcillation defcribes the 
ftiorteft circular Arch pofiible, is equal to the Time of a Body's perpendicular fall by the 
Force of Gravity, through a Space twice the Length of the Pendulum. The Times of the 
Vibrations of two Pendulums of different Lengths, when their Centres of Ofcillation defcribe 
the fmalleft circular Arches pofiible, are in the fubduplicate Ratio of the Lengths of the Pen- 
dulums. Hence it is eafy to find the Length of a Pendulum that fhall perform one of it's 
leaft Vibrations in a given Time: Suppofe any given Number of Seconds. For it is but fay- 
ing, As the Square of 60 Seconds, is to the Square of the given Number of Seconds, So is 
39.2 Inches to the Length of the Pendulum wanted. The Time of the Vibration of a Pen- 
dulum, whofe Centre of Ofcillation defcribes any Arch of a Circle, will be to the Time of 
the Vibration of the leaft Arch pofiible, nearly as the vibrating Arch is to twice it's Chord. 
Hence becaufe the Times of the perpendicular Fall of all Bodies, through any Chords 
of the fame Circle, are all equal between themfelves ; the Times of the Vibration of a Pen- 
dulum, defcribing fmall Arches of a Circle, not much different from their Chords, may be 
taken as equal between themfelves, viz. equal to the Time of one Vibration of it's fmalleft 
Arch. But fincc thefe Times of the Vibrations of the fmall Arches are not exactly and geo- 
metrically equal to one another, the longer Arches being really a longer Time defcribing 
than the fhorter ; and as many fmall Errors, feparately confidered, do not deferve Notice, 
yet a great many put together, muft be taken Notice of and avoided ; and for this Mr Huygens, 
in his llorologhim Ofcill. propofes a Remedy, viz. by making the Centre of Ofcillation 01 the 

Per.dulyr.1

Pendulum defcribe the Curve of the Cycloid, inftead of the Arch of a Circle by means of 
two other equal Cycloids, by which Contrivance all the Vibrations, both great and ftnall, will 
be performed in (he fame Time ; and the Time of any Vibration in this Cycloid is to the 
Time of the perpendicular Fall through the Length of the Pendulum, as the .Circumference 
of a Circle is to twice the Side of the Square inferibed in that Circle. Note, The Demonftra- 
tions of the major Part of what is here faid about Pendulums are given by Mr Huygens and 
others •, and the Pendulum is fuppofed to move in a Vacuum free from the external Refi- 
ftance of the Air, or any other Fluid in it. 

Sir Ifaac Newton, in the fixth Station of the fecond Book of his Mathematical Principles 
of Natural Philofophy, fays, that all the Ofcillations in the Cycloid of a Pendulum, moving 
in a Fluid which refifts it*s Motion in the Ratio of the Velocity will be ifochronal. And if 
the Medium a Pendulum moves in refifts it in the dup'icate Ratio of the Velocity, the very 
fliort Ofcillations are the more ifochronal, and the fhorteft of all are performed nearly in the 
fame Times as in Vacuo, and the Times of them that are performed in greater Arches, are 
fomewhat greater. And alfo the Times of all Ofcillations, both great and fmall, feem to be pro- 
longed by the Motion of the Medium the Pendulum fwings in. This is only Theory. But in 
the general Scholium Sir Ifaac deduces from fome Experiment he made with Pendulums, that 
the Refiftance of the Air to Globes moving in it, when they move fwiftly, is nearly in the 
duplicate Ratio of the Velocity, but when flowly, a little greater than in that Ratio. He alfo' 
fays, that the Refiftance of Globes moving in the Air is nearly in the duplicate Ratio of their 
Diameters, and makes the Refiftance of the Rod of fmall Pendulums to be lb confiderable, as to 
be more than one third Part of the Refiftance of the whole Peni.uium. He makes the Refi- 
ftance of a Pendulum vibrating in Water, to it's Refiftance when vibrating in Air, to be as 5%$ is 
to 1 ', &amp;JV. from all which, joir.d to other Conficterations, we may certainly conclude, that 
the Refiftance of a Pendulum with a globular Bob, when fwinging in the Air, caufes the 
Times of the Vibrations to be longer than they would be in vacuo, and that the denfer the 
Air is, the longer will be their Times of j^efcription •, and the fame is true of lenticular Bobs, 
although in a lefs Degree, becaufe thefe Bobs meet with lefs Refiftance from the Air than 
fpherical ones of the fame Breadth. 

Again, the late Dr Derbam, at Numb. 480. of the Pbilofopbical Tranfaclions, for the Year 
1736, recites fome Expcnmt nts he made on Pendulums vibrating in vacuo, and fays, that 
the Arches of Vibrations in Vacuo were larger than in the open Air, or in the Receiver before 
it was exhaufted. That the Enlargement or Diminution of the Arches of Vibrations were 
conftantly proportional to the Quantity of Air, or Rariety or Denfity of it, which was left in 
the Receiver of the Air-Pump •, and as the Vibrations were larger or fhorter, fo the Times 
were accordingly, viz: 1" in an Hour (lower, when the Vibrations were largeft, and lefs 
and lefs as the Air was re-admitted, and the Vibrations fhortened. But notwithstanding (fays 
he) the Times were flower, as the Vibrations were, he had great Reafon to conclude, that 
the Pendulum moved really quicker in Vacuo than in the Air; becaufe the fame Difference or 
Enlargement of the Vibrations (as ; of an Inch on each fide) would caufe the Movement in- 
ftead of 1" in an Hour to go 6 V or 7" flower in the fame Time, as he found by nice Expe- 
riments. The Doctor alfo fays, that the Length of the Rod of a Pendulum, he found by- 
trial was increafed by the Summer Heat -.'- part of an Inch. All this from Dr Derham. 

Hence the Refiftance of the Air imift certainly be a confiderable Obftacle to the equable go- 
ing of a Clock, although this Caufe has been moftly difregarded by our moft able Clock-Ma- 
kers -, and accordingly, the Irregularities in the going of a Clock are caufed principally. 
r. By the Lengthening of the Pendulum, or its fhortening by heat and cold. 2. By the 
Lengthening the Arch defcribed by it's Centre of Ofcillation, or it's fhortening, caufed by 
the greater or lefs Clcannefs of the Clock, and the greater or lefs Weight, or Force of the 
Springs giving Motion to the Clock. 3. By the greater or lefs Denfity of the Air, (or other 
fluid mixed with it) caufing the Times of the Vibrations to be increafed or leffened, in pro- 
portion to that Denfity. 4. The Pendulum Clocks greater or lefs Diftance from the Centre 
of the Earth. 

It has been commonly faid, that Clocks go fafter in cold Weather than they do in warm 
Weather, becaufe the Pendulum in cold Weather defcribes lefs Arches, and is fhorter than 
in warm Weather. But this can only be true, when the Pendulum vibrates in Vacuo, viz, 
free from any external Refiftance, or when this Refiftance is always unalterable. But in dry 
hard frofty Weather, when the Air is very denfe, and mixed with innumerable fmall icy 
Particles, (the Mercury in the Barometer being very high) the Pendulum may be fo much refi- 
lled as the Times of the Vibrations caufed thereby, may exceed the Times arifing from the 
leffcning of the fmall Arches defcribed, and the fhortening the Pendulum, both taken toge- 
ther. And then a Clock will go flower in fuch cold Weather rather than fafter. The Dutcb, 
who formerly wintered at Nova Zembla, could not make any of their Clocks go ; and Captain 
Midiikton (fee the Pbilofopbical TranfacJions, Numb. 465.) who wintered in the Year 1741, 
at Prince of Wales's Fort on Cburcbill River in Hudfon's Bay, fays, the Cold hindered the 
going of all Watches but one of Mr Grabaw's, which went afways too flow by 15". 

As the fwinging of a Pendulum between the two cyclojdal Cheeks removes one of the Ob- 
ftacles to the equable going of a Clock, fo does it's fwinging in Vacuo another ; and the 

4 M other 



314 A Jhort Account of fome Inflruments, &amp;c. 

other Obftacle arifing from the lengthening or fhortening of the Pendulum by heat and cold, 
has been endeavoured to be overcome by making the Pendulum partly of Wood* and partly 
of Metal, fo that the one may be as much contracted by heat, as the other is lengthened, and 
thereby the Pendulum preferve the fame Length in all VicifTitudes of heat and cold.' Mr 
George Graham (in the Pbilofophical Tranfaftions, Numb. 392.) endeavours to do this by a 
glafs or brafs Tube of Mercury for a Pendulum, inftead of a Rod and Bob. But I think ha 
fails here, as well as in his Method to know the going of a Clock in an Air of the fame Tem- 
perature by means of a Thermometer. For a Barometer, and perhaps Hygrometer, fhould be 
added in order to obtain the principal End of bell knowing and avoiding the Irregularities of 
the going of a Clock. 

I mall conclude this Article upon Clocks with only mentioning two uncommon Treatifes 
upon them, the one in Latin, and the other in French -, in the former of which Treatifes is a 
Contrivance to meafure Time equably, by a Motion caufed by three Weights, two of which 
form two perpetual Levers, by the means of which the third Weight is balanced, and thefe 
two Levers reft upon the Wheel of the Axis, which Axis fhews the Minutes, Seconds, and 
Hour, by means only of an Index. And what is peculiar in this Invention is, that the Time it 
meafures is not really in itfelf the fame as that of common Clocks, nor is it a Pendulum, but 
another Thing, whofe Motions are equable and regulated, as is that of a Pendulum j and 
befides, it will move in all Situations, either horizontal, perpendicular, and oblique. And 
therefore fuch a Contrivance as this has a Profpect of going well at Sea, and thereby being 
helps towards finding the Longitude. In the French Treatife you have feventeen Contri- 
vances of Clocks, fome of which are diverting enough, having fmall brafs Balls perpetually 
dropping through Holes, and out again -, others defcend upon an inclined Plane (though 
thefe are not new Contrivances) •, others are Hour-GlafTes, that turn up of themfelves as foon 
as they are run out ; another is a celeftial Globe, turning about upon the Shoulders of an 
Atlas •, another has the Hours placed horizontally, and another upright, &amp;c. The two 
Treatifes are,

XIII. Of concave Mirrors or Speculums. 

1. The Focus of parallel Rays is contained between the 4th and 5th Part of the Diameter 
of the great Circle of the Sphere of which the Speculum is a Segment ; and fo, 2. The 
Focus of one of thefe fpherical Speculums is not a Point, but a fmall round Solid of fuch a 
Breadth. 3. The Diameter of the Aperture of one of thefe concave fpherical Speculums, 
fhould not be a Chord of more than 18 Degrees of the Arch of the great Circle whofe Segment 
that Speculum is. 4. Metalline Speculums are not fo eafy to polifh as Glafs ones quicksil- 
vered over on the back-fide, nor do they reflect fo much Light. 5. Thefe Inftruments burn 
beft when they are cold. 6. So that when they are expofed to the Meridian Sun in clear 
frofty Weather their Effects are greateft. 7. In the Focus of any of them directed to the 
Sun at Noon-Day there is not the leaft Appearance of a lucid Image, unlefs it falls upon an 
opake Body, and yet there is in that Place, and in fome of the beft of them, a Fire fo in- 
tenfely hot, that Stones are inftantly melted by it and turned into Glafs. 8. If the Back, 
of a concave Glafs Speculum be covered over with a very white Compofition of Tin and 
Mercury, the Reflection of the Image of the Sun from the Focus will be fo ftrong, that 
the Eye will not be able to bear it's Brightnefs. 9. If a Piece of white Paper be put in the 
Focus of a large Concave of this kind, fo as to receive the contracted Image of the Moon, 
when mining at full on the Meridian in a clear Winter's Night; you will have fo refulgent a 
Light that the ftrongeft Eyes will not be able to bear it; and yet in the Focus there will be 
no Heat at all, inftead thereof there will be found a very piercing cold. 10. The Heat of 
the Focus of a Concave-Speculum will be lefTened, when acting upon any Thing laid upon a 
black Body in that Focus. 11. Whether, if the concave Surface of a Speculum were co- 
vered with fome black polifhed Subftance, the Effect of it's focal Heat would be lefTened. 
12. The Rays reflected from the yellow Colour of Gold are vaftly refulgent, as has been 
found by a wooden Concave polifhed, and nicely covered over with Leaf-Gold, which burn- 
ed with an incredible Power •, as did another covered over with Pieces of yellow Straw very 
accurately fitted together. Hence the different Colours of a Speculum caufes different focal 
I leat. 

The moft eminent burning Concaves that we are certain have ever as yet been made, are 
thofe of Manfred Septala at Milan ; who is faid by Scottus, to have made a parabolical Spe- 
culum, that would burn almoft at the Diftance of 15 or 16 Paces ; thofe of the Fillet's at 
Lyons, whereof one is of Metal, weighing about 400 Pounds ; the concave and convex Sides 
Sides are fpherical, the Diameter of the Aperture 43 Inches ; that of the Sphere whereof it 
is the Segment 14 Feet, the focal Diftance 3 ~ Feet, and the focal Depth is half an Inch. 
By the focal Heat of this Inftrument, Metals, Stone, Bricks, Allies, &amp;c. are melted and 
turned into Glafs. (Sec our Pbilofophical Tranfaclions, Numb. 6. and the Paris Diary of

baus, whofe burning Effects are defcribed in the Acla Eruditorum, publifhed ztLeipJick for 
Jan. '1687, The Diameter of the Aperture of this Speculum was almoft three Leipfick Yards ; 
it was made of Copper Plates not much exceeding the Back of a common Knife in thicknefs, 
and the Focus was two Yards diftance from the Speculum. In imitation of thefe Speculums 
of Mr Tfcbimbausy a certain celebrated Artift at Drefden, made larger burning Concaves of 
Wood, which produced Effects no lefs wonderful. Even fome have made large Concaves 
of this fort, by properly placing 30, 40, or more fquare Pieces of concave or plain Specu- 
lums, on the under Surface of a wooden Concave, whofe Effects were not much lefs than if 
the Surface had been covered all over with them ; and after this manner may polyhedrous 
burning Concaves, either fphencal or parabolical, of a vaft Size be made. 

In the Philofophical Tranfaclions, at Numb. 483. in the Year 1747, there is an Account of 
a Mirror of one Mr Buffon, a Frenchman, confifting of a great Number of fmall plain Mir- 
rors, each of about 4 by 3 Inches fquare, fixed at about 4 of an Inch from one another, up- 
on a large wooden Frame about fix Feet fquare, ftrengthened with many crofs Bars of Wood 
for the mounting thefe Mirrors ; each of them has three moveable Screws, which the Opera- 
tor commands from behind, fo contrived that the Mirror can be inclined to any Angle in any 
Direction that meets the Sun ; and by this means the folar Image of each Mirror is made to 
coincide with all the reft. Twenty-four of thefe Mirrors thus placed, in a few Seconds of 
Time fet fire to a Compofition of Pitch and Tow at the Diffance of 66 French Feet. Alfo 
a fort of Polyhedron, confifting of 168 fmall Mirrors, or fiat Pieces of Glafs of fix Inches 
fquare each, fet fire to fome Beach Boards at the Diftance of 150 Feet. This was done by 
the Marquis Nicolini. And in another Tranfaction of the Royal Society, Numb. 489, for the 
Year 1748, the fame Mr Buffon fays, he has made a polyhedron Speculum fix Feet broad, 
and as many high, which burns Wood at the Diftance of 200 Feet ; melts Tin and Lead at 
the Diftance of about 120 Feet, and Silver at 50 Feet •, and befides, fays, that Heat is not 
proportional to Light, nor do the Rays come from the Sun in parallel right Lines. 

Whether the burning Speculums ot Archimedes and Proclus, by which they are faid to have 
burned the Enemy's Ships at a Diftance, (fee Zonara's Annal. Tzetza'% variarum Hijioriarum, 
Chiliad. 2. Galen 's Book de Temper amenlis \ and others of the Antients) were contrived af- 
ter fome fuch manner, or whether they be not rather fabulous, I leave others to judge. 
As to myfelf, 1 cannot affcrt, whether it be true or falfe, that Archimedes and Proclus could 
have made Speculums to produce fuch great Effects. 

If a Light be fet in the Focus of a concave fphcrical Speculum, the Rays are parallel after 
Reflection •, fo that the Light of a Candle placed in the Focus, will be ftrongly projected to a 
confiderable Diftance, whereby one may be enabled even to fee to read at the Diftance of %o 
or 40 Yards.

MISCELLANIES. 




I. The Comparifon of the Englifh, French, Rhynland, and Roman Foot. 

F the Englifh Foot be i ; the French Foot will be 1.0654 ; the Rhynland Foot 
1.0284; the Roman Foot 0.970, exprefTed in Decimal Fractions. The above 



*M Proportion of the Englijh and French Foot is taken from the Philofophical Tranf- 
atlions, Numb. 465. 

Mr Huygens, at page 152. of his Horolog. Ofcill. fays, the Paris or French 
Foot is to the Rhynland Foot as 144 is to 139 ; from whence it follows, that the Englijh Foot 
is to the Rhynland Foot as 1 is to 1.0284 nearly, as is exprefTed above •, for fince the French 
Foot is to the EngliJJj Foot, as 1.0654 is to 1 ; it will be as 144 is to 1.0654, fo is 139 to 
1.0284 nearly. The Proportion of the Englijh Foot to the Roman Foot, viz. of 100 to qj y 
or 1 to .97, is taken from Dr Bernard's Treatife of Weights and Meafures. Merfennus they^- 
fuit fays, the Roman Foot that they have in their Library at Paris, taken from the Pave- 
ment of the Capitol at Rome is 14 Lines lefs than their Royal French Foot; that is, the Paris 
Foot Royal is to the Roman Foot, as 144 is to 130. He fays alfo, that a Roman Palm is £ 
of a Roman Foot ; and the Rhynland Foot ufed in many Places in Holland, which he fays is 
thought to be equal to the antient Roman Foot, is only fix Lines, or half an Inch lefs than 
their French Foot. 

II. The Proportion of the Englijh Pound Troy, and French two Mark 16 Ounce Weight, 
is as 16 is 21. The Englijh Troy Ounce is to the French Ounce, as 64 is to 6^. The Eng- 
lijh Avoirdupois Pound and Ounce, is to the French two Mark Weight and Ounce, as 6^ is 
to 68 nearly. Theie Proportions are to be found in the aforefaid Philofophical Tranjaclion, 
Numb. 465. 

III. A French Wine Gallon is to an Englifh Wine Gallon as 464.3328 is to 231, where- 
fore the former is very near double the latter. And a French Wine VeiTel called a Muid, 
containing 300 French Wine Pints, or ^y 4 French Gallons of eight Pints each, is 57.89 Eng- 
lijh Gallons of IVincheJler Meafure. A French Pint contains 48 French cubic Inches. As 
1.2092 is to 1, fo is a French cubic Inch to an Englijh cubic Inch. 

IV. A Jhort Account of the Meafure of the Earth, by various Perfcns. 

The Length of a Degree of a great Circle of the Earth, actually meafured by Eratofthenes, 
an antient Geographer of Alexandria, about 200 Years before Chrifl, (which Meafure was 
approved of, made ufe of, and confirmed by Ptolemy himfelf ) is 500 Stadiums. 

Some Arabian Mathematicians, at the Command of their King, about the Year %in, by 
Miafurement, found a Degree to be ^6 of their Miles, and a little more. 

Alhazen* 



The CONCLUSION. 317 

Alhazen, the Arabian Optician, who lived about the Year noo, fays, in his Eook dt 
Crepufculis, that the Compafs of the Earth is 24000000 Paces. 

Mr Snell, about the Year 161 5. a famous ProfcfTor of Mathematicks at Ley den in Holland, 
found a Degree by Meafurement to be 28500 Rhynland Perches, of 12 Rhynland Foot each. 

Bur, 

Parentis, in the 4th Chapter of his General Geography, has corrected this, and makes it 
to be only 2S300 Rhynland Perches. Parentis alfo gives, in that Chapter, the Manner ufed 
both by Eratofihenes and Snell, in the Meafurement of their Degrees of a great Circle of the 
Earth. Snell" s Meafure by himfelf is to be fecn in his Treatife, entitled, Eratofihenes Ba- 

ta"jus. 

Our Countryman Mr Norwood, a Reader of Mathematicks, in a Treatife publifhed at 
London, in the Year 1702. called the Sea-Man's Praftice, containing a fundamental Problem 
in Navigation experimentally verified, touching the Compafs of the Earth and Sea, and the 
Quantity of a Degree in our EngliJJj Meafure, &amp;c. In the Year 1635. with a Circumferen- 
tor and a Chain mtafuring the Diflance from London to York, and taking the Difference of 
Latitude of thofe two Places, with a Sextant of more than five Feet Radius, found a Degree 
to be 3709 Chains, or 367196 Englijh Feet. 

Mr Picart, and other Frenchmen of the Royal Academy of Sciences, by Order of Lewis the 
XlVth, about the Year 1672, meafured and found the Length of a Degree about Paris to 
be 57060 French Toifes of fix French Feet each. Flis Quadrant for finding the Differences 
of the Latitudes was 10 Feet Radius ; and that for finding the horizontal Angles of the Tri- 
angles of Verification 3 ,' French Feet, for he took his Lengths two Ways, by actual Mea- 
furement, and by Trigonometrical alculations of the Lengths of the Sides of feveral Tri- 
angles, in order for one way to prove the other. See the whole Operation (long and trouble- 
iome enough indeed, if compared to Mv Norwood's) in Mr Picart's Eook, called, La Me- 
fiire de la 'Tcrre ; or, in Dr Jurin'% Appendix to Varcnius's Geography. 

Mr Cajfini, in the Year 1700, by Order of Lewis the XIV, repeating the fame Labour 
over again (likewife two Ways), carried a meridian Line of about 7 ~ Degrees, the whole 
Length of France through Paris, from Dunkirk to the Pyrencan Mountains on the Borders 
of Spain, and makes a mean Degree to be 57292 French Totles : He ufed a Sextant of 10 
Feet, &amp;c. See the Hiftory of the Academy of Sciences for the 1701, as alfo for the Year 
1718. 

The Frenchmen who, in the Year 1737, meafured a Degree at Tornea, under the Arctick 
Circle, make it to be 5743*7 French Toifes. They ufed a Quadrant of 2 Feet Radius, with 
a Micrometer upon the Index, by means of which they have taken Angles to Seconds. 
(But this I am certain, the Nature of an Inflrument of that fhort Radius will not admit.) 
They had alfo a Brafs Tclcfcope about nine Feet long, forming the Radius of a Limb or 
Arch of 5 ',- °, made by the late Mr Gc.o&gt;gC Graham, which they tiled in their Bufinefs. 
There is a Defcription of this ^nftrument at page 124. of tlr. Englijfj Tranflation of Mr Mau- 
pertuis's Treatife of the Figure of the Earth, determined from Observations made at the polar 
Circle. They meafured upon a frozen River, with two Feet of Snow upon it, &amp;c. with 
Rods of 30 French Foot long, and different Perfons meafured a Length of 7406 Toifes five 
Feet to within four Inches, as they fay. See particularly in the above Treatife of Mr 
Maupertuis. 

Now in order to reduce all thefe various Meafures into our Englifh ones, thereby to com- 
pare and make them ufeful, we mult get their reputed Proportions to ours. Mr Norwood, 
in his Sea-Man's Pratlice, page 5, tells us, that Herodotus, Suidas, and others, make a Sta- 
dium to be 600 Alexandrian Feet. And at page 6, he fays, that Here Mechanicus makes five 
Alexandrian Feet to be equal to fix Rontan Feet. But fince above one Roman P'oot is to an 
EngliJJj Foot, as 972 is to 1000, therefore will one Alexandrian Foot be equal to 1.166 Eng- 
lijh Feet •, but as there are 500 Stadiums in a Degree, according to Eratofihenes and Ptolemy y 
and as 600 Alexandrian Feet is a S tadi um, there will be 300000 Alexandrian Feet in a De- 
gree, and fo according to this 300000 x 1. 166 or 349800 will be the Number of EngliJJj 
Feet in a Degree, according to Eratofihenes, beimg 66.25 Miles. Note, Mr Norwood, in 
his Book abovementioned, has mi (look in faying, (page 6.) that the antient Roman Foot was 
greater than the Englijh Foot •, and fo has Snell, and Varenius too. 

Mr Norwood, in his Sea-Man's Practice (at page 29.) fays, that according to Alphraganus y 
the Quantity of an Arabian Mile was 4000 Cubits, or 6000 Arabian Feetj and fo the Quan- 
tity of a Degree, according to the Arabian Mathematicians of ^6 of their Miles, as mention- 
ed above, will be 336000 Arabian Feet •, but, fays Mr Norwood, the Length of their Foot 
is fomething uncertain ; they only fay, it is the Length of 96 Barley-Corns laid fide by fide. 
Now this being granted, I myfelf found upon Trial, that 23 Barley-Corns, laid fide by fide, 
extended nearly three Inches ; and lo, according to this, an Arabian Foot is to our Englijb 
Foot, nearly as 96 is to 92, or as 2 4 is to 23. Wherefore, as 23 is to 24, fo is 336000 
Arabian Feet, to 350608 Englijh Feet, in a Degree, or about 66.39 Englifij Miles. Now 
Mr Norwood reckons a Degree of this Meafurement to be much more, viz. 370222 Englijb 
Feet. But he was milted by Mr Snell, who fays, that by Trial he found one Rhynland Foot 
to be equal to 90 Barley-Corns laid fide by fide, and ^6 Rhynland Feet to be about 91 4 

4 N ' Ev^Jb 



3 i8 the CO N C LU S 10 N. 

Englijh Feet •, whereas the true Proportion of one Englijb Foot to one Rhynland one, is very 
nearly as i to 1.0284. 

Again, Alhazen's Account of 24000000 Paces in the whole Compafs of the Earth and Sea 
may be nearly reduced to our Englijh Meaiures thus j there muft be 66666 - r of thefe Paces 
in one Degree. And as a Pace is by all allowed to be five Feet, there muft be 333^32 Ara- 
bian Feet in a Degree ; but fince above it appears, that an EngliJJj Foot is to an Arabian Foot 
nearly as 23 is to 24, therefore then: will be 347825 Englijh Feet in one Degree of Alhazen's 
Compafs of the Earth, being about 65.87 Englijh Miles. Mr Norwood at page 29. of his 
Sea-Man's Practice, makes this Degree to be more, viz. 367283 Englijh Feet. But herein 
he is alfo deceived by making 90 Arabian Feet equal to 99 4. Englifh ones, when 90 of them 
fhould but be equal to about 93.9 Englijh Feet. 

Again, it is eafy to reduce Mr Snell's Meafure of 28500 Rhynland Perches to a Degree, in- 
to Englijh Feet, by having given the Proportion 1 to 1.0284 of an Englijh Foot to a Rhynland 
one, for there will be 342000 Rhynland Feet in one Degree •, and fo 351712 Englijh Feet, or 
taking Varenius's Corrections of Snell's Meafure, viz. being to Snell's in the Proportion of 
235 to 283, a Degree of Mr Snell's will be 349244 Englijh Feet, or about 66.1 Englijh 
Miles. 

Again, Mr Picart's Meafure of a Degree reduced to Englijh Feet, from the Proportion 
1,0654 to 1, of a French Foot to an Englijh one, will be 364710 Englijh Feet, or 69.07 Em- 
UJh Miles. Mr CaJJini's Meafure of 57437 Toifes, will be 367160 Englifh Feet, or about 6cj\ 
Miles. And, laftly, The Frenchmens Meafure of 57437 Toifes, to a Degree under the Ar- 
dick Circle, will be 36-^656 Englijh Feet, or about69.68 EngliJJj Miles. Now all thefe various 
Meafures of a Degree in Englijh Feet, when brought together, will ftand thus : 

Eng. Feet. 

1. Eratojlhenes or Ptolomy's — — — — — — — 349800 

2. The Arabian Mathematicians, or Abeljeda's — — — — — 350608 

3. Alhazen's ■ — — — — — — — — — — — 347825 

4. Snell's corrected — — — — — — — — — — 349244

6. Mr Picart's — — — — ■ — — — — — — — 364710 

•:. Mr Cajfini's — — — — — — — — . — — — 367160 

8. Mr Maupertuis's — — — — — — — — — — 367656 

Upon which we may obferve, that Eratojlhenes and Snell's Meafures of a Degree, do not 
differ from one another, more than 566 Englijh Feet, or about 188 Yards, although very 
differently obtained, which is fome fort of a Confirmation of their being both right, what- 
ever others have faid to the contrary. Likewife Abeljedas's Meafure does not differ from 
Eratojlhenes but 308 Feet, and trom Snell's but 1444 Feet, the former being 266 Yards, and 
the latter about 481 Yards. Nor does Alhazen's Meafure, which is the leaft of all, differ 
about half a Mile from Abeljedas's •, therefore the firft four, and moft antient of thefe Mea- 
fures of a Degree, are not fo unequal, as to be a fort of Argument for their being rejected. 
The other four modern Meafures of a Degree, by Mr Norwood and the Frenchmen, are 
indeed greater, but difitr from one another, more or lefs. For Example, Mr Norwood and 
Picart differ 2446 Englijh Feet. Note, in page 33, of Mr Norwood's Sea-Man's Praclice, it 
is faid Mr Picart's Meafure of a Degree is 365184 Englijh Feet, as taken from the Philojo- 
fhical tranjaclions, Numb. 112. But this is 434 Englijh Feet too much. Mr Maupertuis's 
Meafure is 901 Englijh Feet more than Picart's. 

Hence, allowing the Earth and Sea to be one Sphere, (excepting all Mountains, and Ca- 
vities not exceeding two or three Miles in heighth Or depth, and which bare no fenfible Pro- 
portion to the whole Diameter,) all the abovefaid different Meafures of a Degree cannot be 
true •, nor is it eafy to know which is the trueft, if it be confidered, 1. That the Antients knew 
as well how to meafure Diftances upon the Ground, as the Moderns. 2. That their Plains 
being fo extenfive, upon which they meafured the Diftances for this Bufinefs, viz. thofe of 
Alexandria and the Fields of Mefopotamia, made their Work eafier and lefs liable to Error, 
than the Lengths meafured for the fame Purpofe by Mr Norwood and the French, in crook- 
ed Ways, uneven Ground, or upon Ice covered with Snow. Moft of thefe uneven Lengths 
being apt to be fet down too great, without much Caution, Diligence, proper Correction, and 
trigonometrical Computation and Verification-, and this trigonometrical Meafure by means of 
Angles near upon the Horizon is fubject to Uncertainty, by reafon of the horizontal Refrac- 
tions, (fee Dr Nettkton's Account of this already mentioned by me) it giving the oppo- 
fite Bafes of the Triangles too great in length. 3. I am of Opinion, the Antients could take 
the Latitude of a Place, and draw a meridian Line by their Gnomons, as exactly as any of the 
Moderns can do by their Sextants and Quadrants, armed with Telefcopes. I do not find Mr 
Norwood had any Telefcope to his Sextant more than of five Feet Radius that he ufed. More- 
over, Mr Hevelius would not ufe Telefcopes to his Inftruments, as thinking they added no- 
thing to the Exactnefs of their Ufe. But I think he was wrong in this. 4. The Abilities of 
moft of the Meafurers, viz. Ptolemy (for at leaft he approved of that of 500 Stadiums to a

The CONCLUSION. 319 

Degree.) Mr Snell, Mr Norwood, Picart, Cajfmi, and Maupertius, fufficiently appear by 
their Works. 

From what I have already faid, and feveral other Considerations, I am fo divided in my 
Opinion, as not to be certain which of thofe Meafures of a Degree is the trueft ; and if it were 
not for the Uncertainty of the exact Comparifon of an Alexandrian Foot to our Englijh one, I 
fhould be apt to think Ptolemy's .vleafure to be as true as any of them. Alfo Alhazen's Mea- 
fure mi^ht in reality come out to be nearer to the reft, if we had the exact Proportion of an 
Arabian 'Foot to an Englifii Foot -, for the Comparifon by Barley-Corns is a little uncertain. 
However, as all the eight Meafures do not differ from one another more than about three 
Miles in a Decree. The Medium of them all feems to be the nearelt the Truth, and I think 
ought to be ufed as fuch, 'till it be found by many and good Experiments either to be more 
confirmed, or to be otherwife; and this Medium is about 67.3 Miles to a Degree. There 
are many other Accounts of the Meafure of a Degree to be feen in Authors of no moment 
to mention here. 

V. Of the Notes which were promifed at the Beginning of the Book of Mathematical Injlru- 
ments, together with a few inflrumental Conflruclions of Geometrical Problems. 

An Ellipfis is a curve lined Space, made by cutting a right Cone or Cylinder through, by 
any Plane, making an acute Angle with the Plane ot the Bafe of the Cone or Cylinder. 

A fpiral Line may be thus defenbed If the infinite right Line AC revolves equally Fig. 25, 
round it's end A, and at the fame Time a Pnint B moves from A equably along that right 
Line, and the Velocities of the Line A C, and that of the Point B along it, be as the Circum- 
ference of a Circle is to its Diam ter, then will the Point B defcribe a fpiral Line, of an in- 
finite Number of Revolutions upon the Plane, whereon the right Line revolves. I have feen 
fuch a Spiral defenbed upon the Surface of a round revolving Table, by drawing a Piece of 
Chalk, or a Pencil, held in the Hand equably along that Surface from the Centre to the Cir- 
cumference. Note, There are many other Species of fpiral Lines befides this here ; but 
this is one of the moft fimple. Or a fpiral Line may be obtained thus, by finding a great 
many Points through whicn it muft pafs. Let B D E (Fig. 26.) be a Circle, whofe Centre Fig. 26. 
is A, and BE, F D, two Diameters croffing one another at right Angles infinitely continu- 
ed ; find a right Line M N equal to the Circumference of that Circle, either by making as 7 
is to 22, fo is the Diarmter to B '\ to M N or elfe by wrapping a String quite about the Cir- 
cumference. This done, divide the right Line M N into a great even Number of equal 
Parts Mp, and the Circumference of the Circle F B E into the fame Number of equal Parts 
by trial •, let B Q^be one of thele Parts, draw the Radius A Q^, and upon it take A P equal 
to the part Mp of the right Line M N, then will P be one Point of the Spiral, and dou- 
bling the Arch B Q_^, and drawing a Radius as before, upon this lay off from A, the double 
el" the Part M p of the Line M N, and another Point of the Spiral will be had ; and by a 
Repetition of thefe Operations, with the Triples, Quadruples, &amp;c. of the equal Arches 
B Q^, and the equal Parts Mp. other Points will be obtained, through which the Spiral 
mutt pafs. AD continued to 1, fo that A P 1 be equal to ~ M N, or a the Circumfe- 
rence : A E to P 2, fo that A P 2 be equal to ' M N •, A F to P 3, fo that A P 3 be equal 
to|MN; A B to P 4, fo that A P 4 be equal to M N, then will Pi, P 2, P 3, P4, be 
other Points of the Spiral. If A P be continued downwards, fo that Ap be equal to A P 2 
-j- A P, then will p be another Point. When Points enough fufficiently near be found, 
and properly joined, one Revolution A P 4 of the Spiral will be had j and another Revolu- 
tion will be obtained, by finding Points through which it muft pafs thus. Continue out 
A P to S, fo that A S be — M N j- A P, then will S be one Point of this fecond Revolution 
of the Spiral. And thus may any Number of Points be found for this fecond Revolution. 
For a third Revolution A S muft be — 2 M N -j- A P, and fo on, then will S be a Point 
of a third Revolution. 

Hence the Nature of this Spiral is fuch, that any Radius A P is equal to the correfpon- 
dent circular Arch B Q^, when the Spiral has but one Revolution-, when it has two, any 
Radius of it is equal to once the Circumference of the Circle B D E F, together with the cor- 
refpondent Arch B Q^of the Circle ; when three, equal to twice the Circumference, added to 
the correfpondent circular Arch B Q^, and fo on. 

Note, This Spiral may alfo be delcribed by a continued Motion, by means of a String in 
length equal to one or more Times the Circumference of the Circle B D E F, having a further 
additional Length equal to the Radius A B of that Circle; for if one end Q^of fuch a String be 
fattened to the end Q^, of a moveable Radius A Q^, and that String be wrapped about the 
Circumference of the Circle, when A B and A Qcoincide, and the other end A of that String 
be extended tightly down the fixed Radius A B, from B to A, (and there bent upwards) and 
that Radius A Quarrying the end Q^ of the String moves round from B to Q, &amp;c. at the 
lame Time that the other end A of the String is perpetually drawn tightly up from A to P 
along that moveable Radius A Qjiow in the Situation A Q^ By this Motion the Point P, 
or end of the String, will defcribe the Spiral, for the part A P of the String is always equal to 
the Arch B O , which is difengaged from as much of the String as is equal to it in length. 

The 



3 2 o The CONCLUSION. 

The Ufe of this Spiral is confiderable in the Solutions of fome difficult Problems rela- 
ting to the Divifion of the Archts of Circles into any Number of equal Parts, or given Ra- 
tio's, rinding the fides of all regular Polygons. Dividing a Circle into two Segments that 
fhall have a given Ratio, proving that the abfolute Quadrature of the Circle is impofii- 
ble, 65V. 

Fig 27. An Example of one Ufe is as follows : To draw aright Line G Q^(Fig. 27.) from a given 

Point G, in the Diameter HE, of a given Semicirle B QJi fuch, that it lhali divide the 
fame into two Segments B QJ3, G O^E, having the given Ratio of M to N. 

Let A H P I be a part of a Spiral, as above fuch, that any Radius A P of it be equal to 
the correfpondent Arch B Qof the Semicircle B Q^E, then will A E continued out to cut the 
Spiral in J, be equal to the Length of the Arch B QE of the Semicircle. Make as M -j~ 
N : M : : A I : R. From the Centre A of the Semicircle, raife the Perpendicular A K — A 
G, and upon A K defcribe a Semicircle, take a right Line or Ruler in length equal to R, 
and always making it pafs through the Centre A, move one end S of it along the Semicircle 
K S, 'till the other end P of it cuts the Spiral in P, and the Semicircle B QjE in O^, join GQ^, 
and the Bufinefs will be done ; for then will the Semicircular Space B Q^G be to E Q^G, in 
the given Ratio of M to N. The Demonftration is eafy, for A S is always equal to the Per- 
pendicular G L, drawn from G upon A Q, and the Space B QJj is always as the Arch B 
Q/f-G L ; that is, as A P ,-, S = R, Csfr. 

Note, This Problem is otherwife constructed in Sir Ifaac Newton's Principia Maihem. 
Lib. I. by means of an Epicycloid, which he tells you there how to defcribe. 

Fig. 18. To trifeel a given Angle A C B About the angular Point C, with any Semidiameter FC 

or CG, defcribe a Semicircle F E G, cutting the fide C A of the given Angle in E ; conti- 
nue out G F, and laying the Edge of a Ruler N E to the Point E, fo turn it that the Part 
N M be equal to the Radius of the Circle, then will the Arch F M be 4 of the given Arch 
E G, or the Angle F C M - A C B. 

Fig. 29. To find two continual mean Proportionals between two given right Lines X and Y. Make the 

rightangled Parallelogram A B C D, having its fides A B, AC, equal to the given right 
Lines X and Y, and defcribe a Circle about this Parallelogram, whofe fides A C, A B, let 
be continued out, and laying the Edge of a Ruler E F to the Point D, turn the Ruler about 
'till it's Edge fo cuts the Circle in G, and the Continuations of A C, A B in E F, that the 
Parts E D, G F of that Edge be equal between themfelves, then will the four right Lines 
X, C E, B F, Y be continual Proportionals. Both thefe Problems are folid ones, as they 
are called, and cannot be conftructed geometrically by the Interferon of right Lines and 
Circles. There are many other Ways of conftrucling them by the conic Sections, well 
known to Geometricians ; but none eafier in the Practice than thefe two above given, being 
in effect by the Interferon of a Circle, and the Conchoid of Nicomedes, a famous curve 
Line, efteemed both by Archimedes and Sir Ifaac Newton, as the beff for the Conduction of 
folid Problems, with regard to the fhortnefs and facility of the Practice, the Curve itfelf be- 
ing almofl as eafily defcribed as the Circle ; and of fuch a Nature, that the part of a right 
Line drawn from any part of the Curve to the fixed Pole intercepted by a given right Line, 
viz. it's Afymptote, is of a given Magnitude. 

A Parabola is a curve-lined plane Space, or Section, made by cutting a Cone by any plain 
Parallel, to any Plane touching the fide of a Cone in a right Line. An Hyperbola is a Section 
or curve-lined plain Space, made by cutting a Cone, by a Plane not parallel to a Plane 
touching the fide of that Cone in a right Line, nor palling through the Vertex of the Cone. 
Note, It is common to call the curve- lined Terminations of the Ellipfis, Parabola, and Hy- 
perbola, by thefe Names, inflead of thefe Planes of Section, which they really are. A Pa- 
rabola opens wider and wider infinitely, according as the Cone whereof it is the Section is 
more continued out, and fo does an Hyperbola too. Although fuch a Section of one Cone 
only, as has been defcribed above, is ufually called an Hyperbola, yet it is but one part of 
an Hyperbola, ftrictly fpeaking, for there is another fuch fimilar Section made by cutting 
the oppofite Cone by the fame Plane, that goes to make up one compleat Flyperbola. That 
is, an Hyperbola confifts of two oppofite fimilar Parts, having their Convexities next to one 
another, and at fome Diftance from each other. The middle Point of which Diftance is the 
Centre through which thofe two right Lines drawn to touch the Flyperbola at an infinite Di- 
ftance are called Afymptotes, and that Flyperbola whofe Afymptotes are at right Angles to one 
another, is called an Equilateral Hyperbola, which of all the different Species is the moft fimpie 
and ufeful. 

The Ellipfis, Parabola, and Hyperbola, are called Conic Sections. If two parallel right 
Lines terminating in a Conic Section be bifected, and a right Line be drawn through the 
Points of Bifection meeting the Curve, either in one or two Points, this bifecting right Line 
is called a Diameter, which will bifect all Parallels to thofe firft mentioned ones. Thefe Paral- 
lels are called Ordinates to that Diameter, and in the Ellipfis and Flyperbola, the middie Poinc 
of any Diameter is called the Centre, and that Diameter drawn through the Centre parallel to 
an Ordinate to any Diameter, is called a conjugate Diameter. That Diameter whofe Ordi- 
nates are at right Angles to it, is called an Axis, and the Point wherein it meets the Curve, is 
called the Vertex. In the Parabola each Diameter meets the Curve in one Point only, and 

they 



The CONCLUSION. 3 ai 

they are all parallel to the Axis. If any two parallel right Lines terminating in a conic Section 
be cut by another right Line terminating in that Section, the Ratio of the two Rectangles un- 
der the Segments of thofe two Parallels, will be equal to the Ratio of the two Rectangles under 
the two Segments of the cutting Line and one Parallel, and the Segments of that cutting Line 
and the other Parallel. And fo if this cutting Line be a Diameter, patting through the Centre, 
the Rectangle under the two Parts of it, cut by any Ordinate, will be to the Square of that 
Ordinate in a conftant Patio, viz. as the Square of that Diameter is to the Square of the 
conjugate Diameter, or as that Diameter is to a third Proportional to thofe two conjugate 
Diameters which third Proportional is called the Latus retium of thofe Diameters. But in 
the Parabola, the Square of any Ordinate is equal to the Redlangle under the Segment of the 
Diameter intercepted between the Vertex and that Ordinate, and a right Line of a conftant 
Magnitude, called the Latus retlum, or Parameter of that Diameter. Moreover, in the Hy- 
perbola and Ellipfis, the Tangent at the Extremity of any Semi-ordinate to a Diameter, and 
that Semi-ordinate will fo cut that Diameter, as that the Rectangle under the Diftances of the 
two Points of Section from the Centre, will be always equal to the Square of half that Dia- 
meter. And in the Parabola any Tangent cuts a Diameter continued out, as far beyond the 
Vertex of that ) Tiameter, as the Semi-ordinate of that Diameter, drawn from the Point of Con- 
tact is diftant from the faid Vertex. In the Hyperbola two infinite Tangents, viz. the Afymp- 
totes crofs one another in the Centre •, and if it be made as the Semi-axis is to the Diftance from 
the Centre of any Semi-ordinate, fo is that Semi-ordinate to a fourth Proportional, and a Per- 
pendicular raifed at one Vertex of the Axis be made equal to that fourth Proportional j a right 
Line drawn through the Centre and the Extremity of that Perpendicular will be one Afymp- 
totc, and the other Afymptote will be had by drawing a right Line through the Centre, ma- 
king the fame Angle with the Axis as the firft Afymptote does. The Foci of an Ellipfis are 
two fixed Points in the great Axis equally diftant from the Centre, by the Length of a mean 
Proportional between the Sum and Difference of T , the great and 4 the letter Axis. And two 
rio-hc Lines drawn from thofe two Foci to any Point of the Curve will be equal to the greater 
Axis. But in the Hyperbola, the Foci are two Points in the tranfverfe Axis equally diftant 
from the Centre, fuch that the Difference of two right Lines drawn from them to any Point 
of the Curve will be equal to the traverfe Axis. In the Parabola, the Focus is a Point in the 
Axis diftant from the Vertex by \ of the Latus rettum. In the Ellipfis and Hyperbola, two 
right Lines drawn from the Foci to any Point of the Curve, make equal Angles with a Tangent 
dr.ivvn through that Point. In the Parabola, a Line drawn from the Focus to the Point of 
Contact of a Tangent, will make the fame Angle with that Tangent as a Diameter drawn 
through that Point of Contact does. In the Hyperbola, if any right Line be drawn cutting the 
Alyrnptotes, as well as the Curve in two Points, the two Parts of this Line intercepted, be- 
tween the Curve and one Atymptote, and the Curve and the other Afymptote, will be equal 
to one another. So that if this Line cuts the Curve in two Points infinitely near to one ano- 
ther, viz. is a Tangent to the Curve •, the two Parts of that Tangent between the Point of 
Contact, and the Afymptotes will be equal to one another. And all Triangles made by fuch a 
Tangent, and the two Segments (from the Centre) of the Afymptotes cut off by that Tangent, 
will be equal to one another. Wherefore every Triangle made by a Semi-diameter drawn to 
the Point of Contact, by half of that Tangent, and by the Segment of one Afymptote cut 
oft" by that half of the Tangent, will be of a conftant Magnitude. And if from any Point 
of an Hyperbola a right Line be drawn upon one Afymptote parallel to the other Afymp- 
tote, the Parallelogram under that right Line, and the Segment (from the Centre) of the 
Afymptote cut by it, will be of a conftant Magnitude. 

I have collected together thefe few Definitions, and fundamental Properties of the Conic 
Sections, for the Ule of thofe who may have fomeOccafion for them, either in the Conftructions 
of Problems, or for other Purpofes, and have not the Books at hand, which treat of them 
fully, and as they lhould be ; nor even know, perhaps, that the Conic Sections have fuch 
Properties. 

The eafieft Way of defcribing by one Operation a Parabola and Equilateral Hyperbola 
by means of Points, is thus, 

Upon the infinite right Line C E (Fig. 30. Numb. 1, 2.) affume two Points A and F, and F'g- 3»» 
through A draw the right Line A B perpendicular to C E. In C E from A take any Point P 
on the contrary fide of A that F is, for the Parabola, but on the fame fide for the Equilate- 
ral Hyperbola •, and in this laft Cafe greater, at fuch a Diftance from A, that F P be greater 
than A F, and from P (Numb. 1.) take the Point Q^in A B diftant from P by the Length 
F P-, but in (Numb. 2.) diftant from F by the Length F P. This done, about the Points Q^ 
F (Numb. 1.) and Q^P (Numb. 2.) with the Diftance F P defcribe two Arches interfering 
one another at M, and M will be one Point of a Parabola G A H, or equilateral hyper- 
bola G F H. The former pafling through the. Point A, and the latter through the Point F. 
About the Centre A with the Diftance A M defcribe a Circle cutting the right Line C E, or 
Axis of the Parabola or Hyperbola in the Points 1 1, and make one Arch I m (Numb, i.) 
and three Arches I m (Numb. 2.) equal to the Arch I M, then will m be another Point ot 
the Parabola, and m t m t m, thre« other Points -of the oppofite Hyperbola's G F H, g f h. 
and by a Repetition of many more fuch Operations, a Number of Points M, m, may be 

4 O found 



3 2,z The CONCLUSION. 

found To near each other, as that being properly joined, a Parabola, or equilateral Hyper- 
bola fufficiently exact, will be formed. 

A Parabola, Hyperbola, and Ellipfis, may be defcribed by a continued Motion. All 
three by the fame way of Operation varied, by means of a moveable Square anil moveable 
Ruler. For if the Angle of a Square be fattened to a given Point, fo that the Square be 
moveable about the fame, and the Interfection of one fide of that Square and a Ruler movino- 
parallel to itfelf, be carried along a given right Line •, the Interferon of the other fide of 
that Square, with that Ruler, will defcribe part of the Curve of the Parabola. But if the 
moveable' Ruler, inftcad of moving parallel to itfelf, moves about a given fixed Point, and 
the fixed right Line be between this Point and the angular Point of the moveable Square, 
fuch an Interfection of one fide of that Square, and this moveable Ruler, will defcribe part 
of the Curve of an Hyperbola. If the two fixed Points aforefaid be both on the fame fide, 
the fixed right Line, part of the Curve of the Ellipfis will be defcribed by fuch a Motion! 
This Manner of defcribing the Curves of the Conic Sections is well known to Geometricians. 
The following Way of defcribing any Hyperbola, by a continued Motion (being that of Mr 
Be Witt's in his Element a Linearum Curvarum) by having the Afymptotcs AE, A F (Fig. 

Fig. 31. 31.) given, as alio a Point B, through which the Curve is to pals is thus ; from B draw 

B G parallel to A E cutting A F in G, take a Bevel D C F, whofe Angle C is equal to the 
given Angle A. In the fide C Q^of the Bevel take the Point Qjit the fame Dittance from 
C, as G is from A, and at Q_ fallen the end Q^ of a Ruler QJ3 always pafling through the 
fixed Point B. This done, move the fide CF of the Bevel along the Afymptote A F, and 
the Interfection P of the Ruler QJB, and the other fide CD of the Bevel, will defcribe the 
part I B K of an Hyperbola pafling through the Point B ; and whofe Afymptotes are A E 
AF. 

Prob. I. The Point B being given, as alfo the Angle E A F, and the Space S, to draw a 

??g. 32. right Line BQ^ to form the Triangle AP Q^ equal to the given Space S. (Fig. 32.) This 

is a noted plain Problem, but I take the eafiefl Way of conftfucting it to be by a parallel 
Ruler, thus : Make fome Triangle A C D equal to S, then take a parallel Ruler, and Jettirg it's 
two oppofite Sides P C, D Q^, always pafs through the given Points D, C, fo move it, that a 
Ruler laid from B fhall interfect thofe it's two oppofite fides at P and Qjvhere thefe fides cut 
the fides A E, A F of the given Angle, then will the Triangle A P QJ)e equal to the Space S. 

Note, The Hyperbola within it's Afymptotes is the only curve Line that is natural to the 
Conftruction of the Problem above, and a fmall Knowledge in the Nature of this Curve, is 
alone fufficient for any one of himfelf, to find out feveral different Conflructions of the Pro- 
blem, as well Mechanical as Geometrical, without any other Affiftance, the Problem being 
in effect only to draw a Tangent to a given Hyperbola within the Afymptotes from a given 
Point. 

Fig. 33. Prob. II. The Lengths of the three contiguous Chords A B, B C, CD (Fig. ^.) inferibed 

in a Semicirle being given : to find the Diaweter of that Semicircle. 

This is an old folid Problem, and it may be conftructed thus : Draw two right Lines 
(Numb. 2.) BH, BF, at ri-ght Angles to one another, and make A Bequal to one of the given 
Chords A B. About the Point B with a Diftance B C equal to the fecond given Chord B C 
defcribe a Circle G C H. This done take a Square A C D, one fide C D of which is equal to 
the third given Chord C D. Let the other fide A C of this Square pafs through the given 
Point A, while the end D of the fide C D moves along the right Line B F, 'till that Square 
becomes fo fituate, that it's angular Point C falls upon the Circumference of the Circle GC 
H-, then will the right Line A D, joining the given Point A, and the end D of the Square 
thus fituate, be the Diameter required of the Semicircle. 

fig. 34. Prob. III. Given the Bafe AB (Fig. 34. Numb. 1.) of a Triangle ABC, the Aggregate of 

the fides AC, B C, and the Length of a Perpendicular BD to the fide B C drawn from one of 
the Angles B to the other fide A C, to confirucl the Triangle. 

This is an old hyperfolid Problem of Mr IVard's, in his Compendium of Algebra, and is 
thus conftructed. Draw (Fig. 34. Numb. 2.) two right Lines F B, B G, at right Angles 
to one another. Make B D equal to the given Perpendicular B D, and about the Point B 
with the Diftance B F equal to the given Bafe A B defcribe a Circle A F H ; this done, take 
a Thread in length equal to the given fides A C, B C taken together, and fattening one end 
of it to the Point B, partly extend it along the right Line B C from B to C, and partly from 
C through the given Point D, 'till it's other end A falls upon the Circumference of the Circle 
A F H. Join the Points A and B, and the Triangle ABC required will be formed. 

3« 2 , 6 Prob. IV. Given the Area of a Triangle ABC, (Fig. 36.) as alfo it's Perimeter, when it is 

inferibed in a given Circle, to confirucl fuch a Triangle. 

This is an old folid Problem to be feen in Mr Ozanam's Mathematical Dictionary, and is 
thus conftructed. Let a Line P be equal to the given Perimeter of the Triangle, and a Line 
Qj:he fide of a Square equal to the given Area ; take three double Squares A E B E H, A D C 
D H, and C F B F H, having three equal fides E H, F H, D H, each being a third Propor- 
tional to 4 P and Q^, and faften their three ends H together, fo as to be moveable about H 
like a Joint. And at any Point A of the Periphery of the given Circle, place two of the oth&lt; r 
fides A B, A C of thofe Squares, fo as to be moveable about the faid fixed Point A. This 

done, 



The CONCLUSION. 3 a 3 

done, fo move the three Squares about, as that the Interferons of the fides A B, AC, with 
BC 'always fall in the Circumference of the given Circle, at the fame Time that a Thread 
equal to P may be extended tightly from A to B, B to C, and from C to A again. When 
this happens, the three fides A B, BC, AC of the three double Squares will be fo fituate, 
as to form an inferibed Triangle ABC in the given Circle, whofc Circuit fhall be equal to 
the given right Line P, and Area equal to the Square of the given right Line Q. 

Note, Mr Ozanam firft obtains an algebraic cubic Equation, in order to conftruct this 
Problem by the InrerfecYion of a Parabola, and the given Circle, but fuch a cubic Equation 
may much eafier be obtained after the following Manner. (See Numb. 2. Fig. 36.) Let the Fig. 36, 
unknown fide AC of the Triangle required be called 2 x, and A C be bifected in G. Let G D 
be called z, and fuppofe DEF to be a Circle inferibed in the Triangle ABC fought. Let 
A B f- B C --j- A C given be = 4 a, and 2 ab — to the given Area of the Triangle ABC, 
alfo let d be equal to the Diameter of the given Circle wherein the Triangle ABC is to be in- 
feribed ; then, (by the Nature of the inferibed Circle G E F) will AE = AD, E B — B F, 
C D -= C F, and fo E B -j- B F = 4 a — 4 x, and F B ~ E B = 2 a — 2 x. Wherefore A C 
= 2 .v, C B = 2 a -T- x — z, AB = 2 a — x -\- z. Therefore by the old Rule of finding the 

Area of a Triangle by having the three fides, it will be &lt;J 2 a — 2 x xx ~- { - zx x — z x 2 a 

ax 1 — x z — abb 

z= 2 a b, or x x — z z x a — x —abb., or z z = p ~ ~" Again, becaufe from 

the Nature of the Circle ABC, the Rectangle under A C and CB"a Rectangle under the 
Diameter, and the Perpendicular drawn from C upon the oppofite Side A B of the Triangle 

2 X X 2 CI X Z 

ABC; we fhall have — = that Perpendicular ; and therefore the Area of the 

a 



Triangle ABC, will hex x 2 a — x — zx 2 a — x-f-z = 2 a b d, or 4. a a — A.a x~\~x x —

Prob. V. To conftitute a Triangle F P G (Fig. 35.) fuch that the three fides F P, F G, P G, Fig. 35. 
and the Perpendicular F H drawn from the Angle F upon the third fide P G, fhall be four arith- 
metical Progreffwnals 

This is the J4th Problem of Sir Ifaac Newton*s univerfal Arithmetick, and a folid Problem. 
AfTume any right Line FG for one of the fides of the Triangle required, and with the 
ends F and G of it, as Foci, with an Axis A B equal to twice that fide, defcribe a Semi-El- 
lipfis A D B whofe Centre is C, erect; the Perpendicular G M upon the Focus G, equal to 
C F or C G, and upon M G defcribe a Semicircle M N G ; this done, take a Ruler G N P 
always moveable about the Point G, and fo turn it about, that the part N P of it beyond the 
Point N, where it cuts the Semicircle M N G intercepted between that Semicircle and the 
Ellipfis, be equal to the given focal Diflance C G, or the Diameter G M of the Semicircle. 
Join the right Line F P, then will F P G be the Triangle to be conftructed. 

Upon F G defcribe the Semicircle F H G. Now it eafily appears from the Conflruction, 
and the Nature of the Ellipfis, that F P, F G, and G P, are continual arithmetical Progref- 
fionals, for F P--j-PG = AB=2F G, and from the Nature of the two Semicircles F H G, 
M N G t it is eafily proved that the Chord GN of the Semicircle G M H is equal to one 
half of the Chord F H, (or perpendicular toGP) for becaufe of the right Angles F H G, G N 
M, as alfo C GM, the right angled Triangles G N M, E F H will be equiangular. Where- 
fore F G : G M :: F M : G N :: 2 : 1, and fo G N = l F H ; and becaufe P N = C G, it 
will be G P = i F 1 1 -j- C G ; that is, 2 G P = F H -f- 2 C G, or 2 G P = F H -{- F G ; 
wherefore F G, G P, F H, are alfo arithmetical Progrefllonals. But F P, F G, G P, have 
been fhewn to be fuch already. Wherefore now it appears, that FP, FG, G P, and F H, 
are four continual Progreffionals. 

Prob. VI. To conftrucl a Trapezium A B CD (Fig. 37.) fuch, that its four fides Jhatt be equal Fig. 37. 
to four given right Lines M, N, O, P, any three of which are greater than the fourth, and whofe 
Area fhall be equal to a given Square whofe fide is C\_ 

This plain Problem is to be feen in Ozanam* s Mathematical Dictionary, where it is refol- 
ved in the worft manner poffible. 

Upon the indefinite right Line A Z, take A D equal to one of the given right Lines M. 
About the Centre D, with the Diftance D C equal to the given right Line P, defcribe a Circle 
K C R. This done let N -j- O, be called r \ N — O, s •, and the Hypothenufe of a 
right angled Triangle, whofe Bafe is A D and Perpendicular D C, be called h. Upon A D 
take D G a fourth Proportional to 2 A D, the Sum of h and r, and the Difference between h and 
r. Alfo take D F a fourth Proportional to 2 A D, the Sum of h and s, and the Difference of 
h and s. Upon F G defcribe a Semicircle F H G. Let K R be a Quadrant of the Circle 

KCR. 



324 ^ CONCLUSION. 

KCR. And making C H a third Proportional to 4 A D and Q^, from R take R S equal to 
C H. Continue out R S to V, fo that S V be equal to R D, and about the Centre V with the 
Semidiameter V S defcribe a Circle T H S, whofe Centre falls at V in R D continued, cut- 
ting the aforefaid Semicircle F H G in H, from H draw H C perpenicular to A D cutting the 
Circle K C R in C. Join D C, and about the Centre A with a Diftance equal to the right 
Line N defcribe an Arch of a Circle. Alfo about the Centre C, with a Diftance equal to the 
right Line O, defcribe an Arch of a Circle cutting the former Arch in B. Join A B, C B, 
then will the Trapezium A B C D, be that required. 

The Reafon of the ConftrucYion will be fufficiently evident from what follows. Join 
A C. Let us call AD, J; A C, z ; D L, x. Then, by a well known Property of a 

Triangle, the Area of the Triangle ABC, will be = J r r r _' z ^~ x z'z^Ts 

__ i s = 4 

-—s/rr—hh-Yidxxbb — ss — idx. Since zz = h b — 2 A x. [by 13. 2. Euclid]. 
Let hh — rr — mm, and bh—ss—nn, then will the Area of the Triangle ABC 
be -IV 2dx — mmxnn — 2 dx. Let m m = 2 dp, and nn— 2 d q, then will the Area of 
the Triangle A B C be = ■— ^ — x x -\- p-j-q x x — p q. Now let V — x x~\-p-yqx x — pq 

be = u. And fo — x x -\-p ~\~ q X x — p q — u U, the Locus of which Equation will be a 
Circle, and by Conftruction D G will be equal top, fince it is made as 2 d : h -j- r : : b — r :p. 
Alfo D F will be equal to q, fince, by Conftruction, 2d: h -\* s : : h — s : q, wherefore the 
Semicircle F H G will be the Locus of the Equation — x x -\~ p -]- q x x- — p q—uu, any per- 
pendicular ordinate LH being u ; and therefore if A B C D be any Trapezium whofe fides 
A B, B C, CD, AD, are equal to the given right Lines M, N, O, P, and from the Angle 
C of it be drawn the right Line C L H cutting the fide A D in L, and the Semicircle F H G 
in H, the Rectangle under 4 A D and H L will be equal to the Triangle ABC. But the 
Rectangle under '- A D and C L is alfo equal to the Triangle A C D, wherefore the Area of 
the Trapezium A B C D, will always be equal to the Rectangle under 4 A D and C L -j- L H ; 
that is, equal to the Rectangle under 4 A D and C H. But becaufe the Area is given, viz, 

equal to Q^, therefore Q= 4 A D x CH; that is, C H is a third Proportional to 
4 A D and Q^, wherefore C H is given. Confequently the Problem will be refolved by 
fo drawing the right Line C H of a given Length perpendicular to A D, that one of it's Ex- 
tremes C falls on the Circle KCR, and the other H on the Semicircle FHG; and this may be 
done by defcribing the Locus of the Point H, or end of a right Line CH always moving parallel 
to itfelf, while the beginning C thereof moves along the Circumference of the Circle KCR; 
which Locus will be the Circle T H S equal to the Circle KCR, the Centre being V, and 
Semi-diameter VS = DR. Where this Circle interacts the Semicircle F H G, will give the 
Point H fuch, that C H being drawn will be of the given Magnitude required. The reft 
is fufficiently evident. 

Note, I have given the instrumental Constructions of the few Problems above, as a Spe- 
cimen of the mofteafy, natural, and obvious Way poffible of performing the Bufinefs, in 
order to invite others to proceed in this Way in the Refolution of difficult geometrical Pro- 
blems, rather than by that ufual one fo long in vogue, of firft obtaining an algebraic Equa- 
tion by means of the given Conditions of the Problem ; and then finding the linear Roots of 
that Equation, which in almoft all Cafes is troublefome, unelegant, and unnatural, and in 
many other Cafes is intolerable, and almoft impoffible •, for Example, how difficult would it 
be, by the common Methods, to find the Diameter of a Semicircle, wherein 5, 7, 9, &amp;V. 
given unequal and contiguous Chords may be inferibed ; and how eafy is it to do this by 5, 
7, 9, &amp;c. fquares with the refpective Number (lefs by two) of given Chords fattened by 
their Extremes to each of the Angles of thofe Squares, fo as to be moveable about. More- 
over, as every geometrical Problem points out the beft and moft fimple Way to its own 
Conftruclion, by the Interfections of fome one Line (ftraight or curve) of a given Order, 
with fome other Line of the fame, or a different Order ; thofe Conftructions are beft, when 
thefe Lines are eafieft defcribed, either by the continual Motion of Rulers, Squares, Bevels, 
particular Adaptions of Figures, Threads, &amp;c. or by finding a few Points of thofe interfecting 
Lines, fo many as to determine the Interfections, and when the preparatory right Lines, Per- 
pendiculars, Parallels, Proportionals, &amp;c. are feweft or none at all. Again, all plain Pro- 
blems which have two Anfwers, may be conftrufted by the Interfections of a right Line and 
a Circle, or by the Interfections of two Circles, but oftentimes the Conftruction will be much 
cafier and fimpler done by the Interfection of a right Line and a conic Section. For Ex- 
ample, Vieta fhews how to conftruct a Triangle, whofe Bafe, Perpendicular, and Sum of 
the fides, are each given, by defcribing one Circle through two given Points to touch ano- 
ther Circle. But this is not the beft ConftrucYion ; for, if with the Extremes of the given 
Bafe, as Foci, with a Thread in length equal to the given Sum of the fides, part of an Ellip- 
fis be defcribed ; then a Parallel to the Bafe at the given perpendicular Diftance from it being 
drawn, will interfect the Curve of the Ellipfis in two Points, either of which will be the Ver- 
tex of the Triangle required j and hence it appears, that this Problem of Vieta'i is no more 

than 



the CONCLUSION. 325 

than drawing that Semi- Ordinate to the Axis of a given Ellipfis, which mall have a given 
Magnitude. And even this may be eafily done without the actual Defcription of any Ellipfis 
at a?l differently from Vietas's Way, upon the Confideration of the Manner of defcribing an 
Ellipfis by an elliptick Compafs. 

Pappus tells us, the Antients preferred Mechanical Cohftructions to ufelefs Geometrical 
ones •, and the great Dr Barrow, in his Optical Lectures, has given feveral rnoft eafy and na- 
tural Confirmations of difficult Problems after this way, by means of the Curve-Lines peculiar 
to them •, and whoever delights in Conftructions, will have abundance of Reafon to be high- 
ly pleafd with the Simplicity and Eafinefs of thefe uncommon fort of Conftructions. I my- 
iclf, in Imitation of Dr Barrow, have constructed many Problems after this way. 

Algebra has really nothing to do in the Conftruction of Geometrical Problems, it's Equa- 
tions being Exprtfiions of an Arithmetical Computation, and accordingly whatever is done 
by means of them is rather an Arithmetical Refolution of a Problem than a Geometrical one. 
Befides, when Equations of this fort arife to above two Dimenfions there is no obtaining 
their Roots in rnoft Cafes, unlefs by a troublefome Approximation ; and to find the firft 
Figures of thefe Roots, in order to get the other Figures, Sir Ifaac Newton long ago contri- 
ved an Inftrument for this purpofe. A fhort Defcription of which is to be found in the Com- 
msreium Epiftolicum (publifhed by Order of the Royal Society, in the Year 1725.) at page 123, 
in a Letter from Mr Oldenburgh, their Secretary, to Mr Leibnitz, dated the 24th of June&gt; 
in the Year 1675. He fays, Sir Ifaac's Inftrument confifts of the Logarithms laid off upon 
parallel Rulers, or concentrick Circles, placed at equal Diftances from one another, three Ru- 
lers being fufficient for cubic Equations, and four for biquadratick ones ; they are fo difpofed, 
as that the rtfpective Co-efficients all lie in the fame right Line, from a Point of which fo 
remote from the firft Ruler, as the divided ones are from each other; a right Line is extend- 
ed over them, with Directions conformable to the Nature of the Equation, by which the 
pure Power of a Root fought is given in one of thofe Rulers.

Chap. 2. of the Micrometer. j^y 

agrees wii; the next nearef! fixed Hair of the other Frame ; or, which Is the fame thing, 
move the Frame EFGH the Length of four Lines, or one third of an Inch, which may 
be eafily known by means of the Objeft-Glafs, which magnifies Objects, and count the 
Revolutions and Parts of the Screw, compleated in moving the faid Frame that Length. 
Finally, make a Table, mewing how many Revolutions, and .Parts of a Revolution of the 
faid .Screw, are anfwerabie to every Minute and Second, by having the Angle fubtended by 
the two black Lines on the Board given, and taking the Revolutions proportional to the 
Angles; that is, if a certain Number of Revolutions give a certain Angle, half this 

imbcr will give half the Angle, fcf*. And this Proportion is exad enough in thefe fmall 
.Angles. 

Now the Manner of taking the apparent Diameters of the Planets, is thus : Having di- 

Ltd the Telefcope, and it's Micrometer, towards a Planet, difpofe the Hairs, by the Mo- 
tion of the Telefcope, in fuch a Manner, that one of the fixed parallel Hairs do jutt touch 
une Edge of the Planet, and turn the Screw 'till the moveable Hair juft touches the opppfite 
ge of the. laid Planet. Then, by means of the Table, you will know how many Minutes 
or Seconds correfpond to the Number of Revolutions or Parts, reckoning from the Point of 
the Plate ov.r which the Index iiood when the fixed Hair touched one Edge of the Planet, 
to the. Point it ftands over when the moveable Hair touches the oppofite Edge ; and confe- 
quently, the apparent Diameter of the faid Planet will be had. And in this manner may 
fmall Angles on Earth be taken, which may be eafier done than thofe of the Celeftial Bodies, 
becaufe of their Immobility. 

This Method is convenient enough for meafuring the apparent Diameters of the Planets', 
if the Body of any one of them moves between the parallel Hairs. Yet it ought to be ob- 
ferved, that the Sun and Moon's Diameters appear very unequal upon the account of Re- 
frccl'on ; for in fmall Elevations above the Horizon, by the Space of 20 Minutes, the verti- 
cal Diameters appear fomething leffer than they really are in the Horizon, and the hori- 
zontal Diamctecs cannot be found, unlefs with much Trouble, and ieveral repeated Obferva- 
tions ; as likewifc the Diftance between two Stars, or the Horns of the Moon, becaufe of 
t ; ;;ir Diu.nal r-.fotions, which appear thro' the Telefcope very fwift. 

If two Stirs of different Altitudes pafs by the Meridian at different Times, the Difference 
of their Altitudes will be the Difference of their Diftances from the Equator towards either 
of the Poles, which is called their Difference of Declination ; and by their Difference of Time 
in coming to the Meridian, the Difference of their Diftance from a determinate Point of the 
Equator, that is, the firft Degree of Aries w;li be had j and this is their Difference of Right 
Afcenfion. 

If the two Stars are diftant from each other, we have Time enough, in the Interval of 
their Paffage by the Meridian and Micrometer, to finifli the Operations regarding the firft, 
before proceeding to thofe of the fecond ; but if they be very near each other, it is extremely 
difficult to make both the Obfervations at the fame Time, that fo the two Stars may be pre- 
cifely catched in the Meridian. But M. de la Hire fhews how to remedy this Inconveniency, 
by only ufing the common Micrometer : for the Obfervation of the Paffage of Stars be- 
tween, or upon the Hairs of the Micrometer, will give, by eafy Confequcnces, their Dif- 
ference of Right Afcenfion and Declination, without even fuppofing a Meridian known or 
drawn. 

But if the Difference of Declination and Right Afcenfion of two Stars that cannot be 
taken in between the Hairs of the Micrometer be required, this may be found in the follow- 
ing Manner. 

We adjuft a Crofa-Hair to the Micrometer, cutting the parallel ones at Right Angles, Fig. i&lt;?. 
which we fatten with Wax to the Middle of the Sides A C and B D. Then the Telefcope, 
and it's Micrometer, being fixed in a convenient Pofitio.h, fo that the Stars may fuccefiively 
pafs by the parallel Hair?, as the Stars A and S, in Figure 10 •, we obferve, by a fecond 
Pendulum Clock, the Tune wherein the firft Star A touches the Point in which the afore- 
mentioned Oofs-Hair A S croftls fome one of the parallel Hairs, as A d. The Micrometer 
being difpofed for this Obfervation, which is not difficult to do, reckon the Seconds of 
Time clapfed between the Obfervations made in the Point A, and the arrival of the faid Star 
to the Point B, being the Concourfe of another parallel Hair BD. We hkewife obferve the 
Time wherein the other Star S meets the Crofs-Hair at the Point S, and then at the Point 
D of the parallel Hair B D. Note, It is the fame thing if the Star S firft meets the parallel 
Hair in D, and afterwards the Crofs-Hair in S. 

Now as the Number of Seconds the Star A is moving through the Space A B, is to the 
Number of Seconds- the Star S is moving through the Space S D j fo is the Diftance A C, 
known in Minutes and Seconds of a Degree in the Micrometer, to the Diftance C S, in 
Minutes and Seconds of a Degree. But the Horary Seconds of the Motion through the Space 
AB, muft be converted into Minutes and Seconds of a great Circle, by the Rule of Pro- 
portion. 

Having firft converted the Seconds of the Time of the faid Motion from A to B, which 
may be here efteemed as a Right Line, or an Arc of a great Circle, into Minutes and Se- 
conds of a Circle, in allowing 15 Minutes of a Circle to every Minute of an Hour, and
